    "117": "Several people come out, among them Neff, carrying his briefcase. Lola sees him and stands up, and as he is about to pass through the anteroom without recognizing her, she stops him. Neff looks at her a little startled. He pushes the swing door open and holds it for her. As she passes in front of him, his eyes narrow in uneasy speculation. Neff comes up level with Lola and leads her towards his office, with the camera following them. He opens the door of his office and holds it for her, and she enters. Lou Schwartz, one of the other salesmen, is working at his desk, but Lola enters, with Neff following after her. Lou gets up and goes out. Neff stares at her tensely, and she turns again to the window so he won't see that she is crying. Neff gets up and goes to her. In the foreground, Neff and Lola are having dinner, with the usual activity of Olvera Street—sidewalk peddlers, guitar players, etc.—in the background. Neff and Lola are driving along the beach near Santa Monica. Neff is wearing a light summer suit, in contrast to Lola's mourning. Apparently, she is telling him a story and now and then she laughs, but there is no sound. There is a close shot of Neff behind the steering wheel, and he is only half listening to Lola. Neff, with his hat on and no briefcase, is walking toward Keyes' office. As he comes up close to the door, he stops with a startled expression on his face. On a chair beside the door sits a familiar figure. He is Jackson, the man from the observation platform of the train. He is wearing his Stetson hat and smoking a cigar, studying something in the file folder. Neff recognizes him immediately, but Jackson does not look up. Neff controls his expression and goes on to open the door to Keyes' office. Neff is just closing the door from the inside. Keyes, with his coat off, is lying on his office couch, chewing on a cigar, as usual. Keyes bounces off the couch like a rubber ball and levels a finger at him. Keyes goes to the door and opens it, and Jackson enters with the file folder. Jackson indicates the cigar he himself is smoking and the file folder he is holding. Keyes remembers he forgot to introduce Jackson and picks up the telephone on his desk and speaks into it. Meanwhile, Jackson crosses over to Neff, and during the ensuing dialogue between him and Neff, we hear Keyes' low voice on the phone in the background. Keyes rejoins them at this point and has opened the door for Jackson, who goes out. Keyes puts a cigar in his mouth and starts tapping his pockets for matches.",
    "1263": "Voldemort glances at the snake, and they dis-apparate. Harry continues to shiver as disheveled and dirty, Hermione and Ron approach him. Hermione turns anxiously to Ron, and he crouches down beside Harry. Harry looks worried as Hermione squats down. Harry closes his eyes and takes a deep breath while his jaw remains tense, breathing through his mouth. Nagini is curled up in a boat house where Lucius Malfoy is present with Voldemort, who examines the skin on his own forearm. When Harry opens his eyes, the others stare at him anxiously as the Death Eaters sweep over the school. A student flies in on a broomstick as a giant swings a scythe, and the others fight on the stairs. Hermione runs through a door, narrowly avoiding a bolt, as Harry beats on a door and shoots a Death Eater. A giant with two-pronged weapons spots the trio, and they run, hiding inside a huge bell lying on its side as the giant's weapon strikes it. Colossal spiders appear scrambling over the rubble, causing them to retreat. Hermione runs between the giants, and they fend off attacks with their wands to reach a quieter area. They stop when they spot a Death Eater leaning over a girl's body, as a werewolf glances up. Hermione casts a spell, knocking Fenrir Greyback through a window. They run through a closed-end walkway with the giants keeping pace, smashing the walls. Racing to the front of the school, they see Dementors flying towards them, when suddenly a shimmering barrier is thrown by Aberforth Dumbledore, holding a wand in his outstretched hand. As Aberforth and his allies turn back to fight, the trio sprints away, running onto a raised walkway and down steps towards the boat house lights where Snape is with Voldemort. Voldemort stares at him as Snape perfects a smile, circling him with his eyes fixed on Voldemort. With a slicing move with the Elder Wand, Snape falls against a glass paneled wall with Harry on the other side. Mouth agape, the snake lunges repeatedly at Snape, thumping him against the lead panned glass, which shakes but doesn't give way, as Harry and the others grab helplessly outside. Snape's bloody hand slides down a window and falls limply to the floor as Harry and the others enter the boat house to find Snape still alive. His lower jaw trembles as Harry moves towards him, kneels down, and leans forward to staunch a wound on Snape's neck. The dying Snape turns his head to look at Harry, who gazes deeply into his eyes as a tear rolls down Snape's cheek, while Hermione rummages in her bag and pulls out a small phial.",
    "10": "Brad stands, ready to usher Lester out, as Lester stares at him, powerless. A moving van is parked in front of the colonial house next door to the Burnhams', while a Mercedes-Benz pulls into the Burnham driveway with Carolyn driving and Lester in the passenger seat. As they get out of the car, Carolyn scopes out the movers next door who carry furniture toward the house, and then she heads into the house, followed by Lester. Lester, Carolyn, and Jane are eating dinner by candlelight, with red roses bunched in a vase at the center of the table. Lester suddenly turns to Jane, who looks at him as if he's lost his mind, while Carolyn watches closely. Carolyn gets up, heads toward the kitchen, and is gone. Lester notices Carolyn looking at him critically and remains quiet, staring at his plate, before getting up and starting after Jane, taking his plate with him. Jane stands at the sink, rinsing her plate when Lester enters. Jane turns and stares at him, waiting for him to finish; he looks to her for help, but she's too uncomfortable with the sudden intimacy to provide any. Viewing through greenhouse windows, it's apparent Lester and Jane's interaction is not going well, although we can't hear them. Jane puts her plate in the dishwasher and leaves, and as we follow her out the door, the camera jerks back to Lester calling after her. His point of view, on video: through the kitchen window, Lester is seen at the sink, rinsing off his plate and muttering to himself. Close on the face of Ricky Fitts, illuminated by the screen of his digicam as he videotapes; Ricky is eighteen, but his eyes appear much older, with a wounded quality beneath his tranquil exterior. Lester turns off the faucet, and through the kitchen window, it's clear Ricky is no longer there. Lester's head jerks up as he realizes he's being watched, dries his hands, and tosses the towel on the counter, where it lands next to a framed photograph of Lester, Carolyn, and a much-younger Jane at an amusement park. Throughout all this, Carolyn keeps repeating to herself, arranging her sales materials on a desk, then stripping down to her undergarments. We see Carolyn working with fierce concentration as she cleans glass doors overlooking the patio and pool, scrubs countertops in the kitchen, perches on a stepladder to dust a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom, and vacuums a dirty carpet that will never be clean. Finally, Carolyn stands in front of the mirror, wearing her suit once more, applying lipstick.",
    "654": "Peter nods and stands there with a stupid smile and a blank expression; once again, he simply nods and turns to watch her go as she gives him a little wave, and with a dejected look on his face, Peter walks off down the street. Later, he enters the apartment he shares with Harry, where Norman Osborne is on the phone. Peter saunters over to Harry, who looks up at him before looking a little sheepish as he turns to them both and reads the Bugle's reward for a Spider-Man photo. An armored car hoist ensues, with a camera suspended in a web, and Spider-Man swoops in, floors four robbers, flips another over the shoulder in a double move, kicks a gun from a robber's hand, and jumps on him. He then turns to the camera, and a photograph of Spider-Man swinging off a roof, crawling down a building, saluting the cops is shown to the Bugle's editor, J. Jonah Jameson. Peter hands back his photographs to a girl at a desk, who writes a check, and Peter has his camera slung around his neck. Across the city in the high-rise Oscorp building, Norman is chairing a meeting; he rises and faces the other ten board members, glares at Henry Balkan sitting directly opposite him, while the older man sips from a cup of coffee with his gaze fixed on Norman, who wipes his mouth with the back of his hand as a lopsided grin appears on Norman's face. Colorful balloons and costumed revelers fill Times Square, and Peter's there with his camera, kicking away with it. He aims it at a balcony high up on a massive stone building, where he sees Harry with MJ, who's wearing a high-colored Chinese dress. Harry places his fingertips on her chin and leans in close to try and kiss her, but she turns her head away. Down below, Harry sees Peter neck-craned watching, and MJ and Harry turn to go inside. Peter senses something and looks around uneasily as Harry meets an Oscorp board member who's in a wheelchair, then Peter is disturbed and shifts his gaze under the sky. Beyond the Times Square building with a singular wireless cubed top and other advertising hoardings, an object is moving toward the crowd, and everyone turns to look up as Balkan watches through binoculars. Astride the glider is a figure in a stolen green flightsuit like a goblin with a sharp-featured head, long pointy ears, large yellow eyes, nose, and bare teeth. The glider circles the tall singular building, then heads towards the balcony, weaving this way and that, past giant balloon figures floating above the festival, and the laughing goblin throws something at the building with the balcony, causing explosions that rip out the windows and the floor below the balcony.",
    "552": "Indy finally manages to pull himself atop the tank once more where he punches Vogel over the side, then peers down to Henry, still inside the tank. Indy pulls Henry and Brody from the tank. Vogel pulls himself back atop the tank armed again with the shovel which he swings at Indy, who ducks and grabs Vogel's arm. As Indy winds up to punch Vogel he catches Brody in the face on the backswing, then completes the movement and knocks Vogel down. Vogel's hat sails in and falls to the floor. Before Indy can answer, Vogel is up and swinging with the shovel. Indy ducks but the shovel catches Henry sending him over the side and onto the moving tread. Indy grabs his whip, knocking Vogel aside. As Henry speeds toward the front of the tank to certain doom, Indy, with lightning speed, whips out his bullwhip, wrapping the end of the whip around Henry's right ankle. Sallah draws his horse next to the treads. He tips his fez to Henry. Vogel now punches Indy in the back and grabs him around the neck. Still, Indy refuses to let go of the whip. Sallah reaches out to Henry. Sallah manages to hold onto Henry as he brings his horse to a stop just at the cliff's edge. Indy finally frees himself of Vogel's grasp, twisting his arm painfully away from Indy's neck, then landing a hard blow to Vogel's head. Looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, his face filled with horror. We see his hat blow off and sail over the cliff's edge. The tank trundles over the cliff and plummets to the bottom. Henry, Brody, and Sallah look down at the flaming wreckage of the tank. Looking dazed and bewildered, Indy staggers up behind them. He joins the others at the edge of the cliff, looking down at the wreckage below with a bewildered expression. Finally, Henry becomes aware of his presence. He just looks at Indy, overcome with emotion. Finally, he throws his arms around him. And he becomes aware of his father's embrace. He hugs his father back. Brody and Sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation. Henry pats Indy on the back and Indy collapses, sitting hard on the rocky cliff edge. Unaware, Henry, Sallah, and Brody start to walk away. Henry turns and walks toward the horse with Brody and Sallah. Suddenly the fedora, borne on the wind, blows into scene and lands at Indy's feet. Donovan peers through binoculars to see the Canyon of the Crescent Moon. He lowers the binoculars and turns to Elsa. Now Elsa peers through the binoculars. Indy, Henry, Sallah, and Brody ride into the canyon. Now we turn a corner and they see the hidden city.",
    "823": "Cal waves, and his friend knocks back the wine. The guy, Bernie, eyes him anxiously, then looks down and puts a Macy's bag on the bar, causing Cal to frown, bewildered. Bernie gets up, Cal shrugs and smiles, and Bernie heads out of the bar. Jacob is at the table with one woman, while Cal is woeful. Jacob is listening as Cal glances over at him, and Jacob beckons him. Cal looks over his shoulder for someone else, but Jacob beckons him again. Cal regards Jacob thoughtfully, picks up his drink and cologne, and heads over to Jacob's table just as the woman gets up to leave. Cal nods and sits back down, lowering his glass and staring as Jacob takes a swig of his drink and nods at Cal. Cal studies him, and Jacob cocks his head. Cal nods, and Jacob raises his glass and drinks, prompting Cal to follow suit without using his straw. Jacob beckons to the woman, and Cal looks around. Jacob points at Cal, then gets up and heads off with the pretty dark-haired woman, who smiles at Cal. Cal turns to watch them leave, then relaxes into his chair and sucks on his straw. Molly rushes in front of the TV and starts dancing as Cal and Robbie lean against the kitchen counter, with Robbie letting his head flop onto his hands. Jessica smiles at Robbie, who fidgets awkwardly and looks down. In the mall, Cal ascends on an escalator and strolls through the mall. Hannah and Liz are at a bar with a group, and they all raise their glasses. The guy, who is dark-haired and a bit gawky looking, kisses Hannah on the lips, and Hannah smiles excitedly. Hannah looks over at him and smiles as Liz heads off. Hannah regards her boyfriend, who is playing with his phone and sitting next to another guy doing the same thing. Hannah's smile fades, and her eyes dart as Jacob stands by a glass barrier on the roof terrace of the mall. He bites into a piece of folded-up pizza, dressed smartly in a dark suit, brown shoes, and sunglasses. He leans on the barrier and peers over, looking up and chewing slowly as Cal approaches, wearing a baggy striped polo shirt, blue jeans, and running trainers. Jacob checks his watch and shrugs, then throws Cal's trainers over the barrier, slaps him on the cheek, and marches off. Cal smiles with disbelief, then suddenly relents and takes out his wallet. Jacob looks down at the wallet dryly, then frowns incredulously at Cal. Cal tries on various shirts and ties with Jacob by racks of sunglasses, accumulating loads of shopping bags as his credit card is swiped in a store. In a beauty product store, Cal's credit card is swiped again.",
    "1012": "A motorbike speeds past, and Charles reacts to the exhaust bank. Friday, a female servant, zips up the back of the Queen's black dress and hands her a pearl necklace, which the Queen takes, looks into a full-length mirror, and fastens around her neck before studying her reflection with a fixed stare. As the Queen descends some stairs, Prince Philip emerges from a nearby room. Looking troubled, the Queen descends the stairs, rushes into the courtyard, puts on a head scarf, and gets into the driver's side of a nearby Land Rover, which then pulls away. Three bodyguards quickly jump into a nearby car and follow her. Alastair bursts into Tony's office, goes to the door, and Tony looks up at Alastair as he leaves the room. The Queen's Land Rover enters the grounds of a country estate, followed by the bodyguards' car. The Queen emerges from the Land Rover, gazes around, and a middle-aged man in a cloth cap emerges from a nearby door. On seeing the Queen, he removes his cap, unlocks the door to a small, stone building, and opens it for her to enter. The Queen removes her sunglasses and glances at something inside: the stag, which hangs from the ceiling by its feet at the center of the room, skinned and with its head removed, with a patch of blood under the body. The Queen sees the stag's head and antlers arranged side-by-side on a nearby table, gently touches the side of the stag's head, and, with her face turned away from the man, catches her breath. The Queen closes her eyes, composes her features, turns to face the man, looks at the stag's body again, and moves towards the door, which the man opens. Video footage shows a carpet of flowers around the gates and walls of Buckingham Palace, with crowds swarming outside. Inside a plane, the Queen sits and stares out of a window in contemplation until Robin appears and stands before her. The Queen turns back to the window while Robin stares at her before the Queen turns back to him. Robin leaves, revealing the Queen Mother sitting opposite the Queen. Alastair is handed a sheet of paper, sits at his desk, and video footage shows the Queen arriving at Buckingham Palace. Black cars drive up to the palace and past crowds gathered behind barriers; inside one car, the Queen and Prince Philip watch the onlookers. In his office, Alastair scribbles some notes on the sheet he was given and hands it to Tony.",
    "702": "Harry holds out a hand, and Peter clasps it firmly. Harry nods, and Peter gets to his feet. They spin round to face their enemies. Venom flies at Peter. Harry swings Peter like a club to hit Sandman. He blasts Sandman's arm with flames from his sky stick. Sandman tries to grab Harry, but the monster's huge arm shatters like glass. Jameson's in the crowd below. He tries to take a photograph. The camera's empty. Jameson glares at the girl. Peter and Harry duck Sandman's huge fists. Above them, the cab plummets towards Mary Jane. The cab misses her. She hangs on by a thread. Harry and Peter fly towards her on the sky stick, weaving past the sandy hulk. The thread breaks, and Mary Jane tumbles. Peter slues the sky stick round. Being onto each other, they surf past Sandman, and Peter leaps off the sky stick and catches her. The watching crowd go wild as he swings away on a thread carrying Mary Jane in his arms and lands back on the half-built skyscraper. He nods through his torn mask. Sandman grabs at Harry. Peter kicks sand in Sandman's eyes. Sandman lumbers round, bemused, then punches Peter with his massive arm, sending him flying up to one of the upper floors of the half-completed building. He's out of Sandman's reach. He fires rockets from the sky stick. They hit their target, and the enormous sand creature staggers back, crumbling and disintegrating. As his huge left arm crumples into the ground leaving out of dust, the crowd whoop their delight. High up on the skyscraper, Peter, his Spider-Man mask badly torn, his eye and mouth quite visible, looks around for Venom. As Peter turns his way and that, Venom grabs him from above and hurls him into a girder. Peter falls on his face. Venom lassos his wrists with two black threads and holds him to his knees. He whacks him with an iron bar. He hits him twice more, ripping the mask right off. Venom holds the jagged metal bar to Peter's neck. Venom's tendrils engulf Brock's face. As he goes to stab Peter, a pumpkin bomb cuts into him. Harry flies up. Venom snatches the sky stick from under him. As Harry falls, he gets a rack of long metal tubes that fall to the floor. Peter still trapped watches as Venom puts his hands to his ears and seems to half-disintegrate. Peter remembers hitting himself on the bell when he tried to tear the black suit off. Venom leaps down Peter, wielding the sky stick as a weapon. Harry steps in between them. Harry looks down at the two blades protruding through his chest. Venom hoists him up into the air and tosses him away.",
    "631": "He switches it on as Merrill kneels beside him. Merrill removes the pickaxe from under the doorknob and pulls open the door. Gingerly, he starts to climb the gloomy stairwell leading up into the kitchen, thick rays of sunlight pouring through irregular holes punched into the wooden planks across the window. In the basement, Graham watches as Merrill tentatively reaches the top of the steps and looks around. Merrill turns left and disappears from Graham's view. Merrill reappears, looks down the stairwell, and nods. Graham carries Morgan slowly up the stairs and into the kitchen, where chairs are strewn across the floor, and the fridge door is open. Bo follows her father and then wanders out into the hallway as Graham carries Morgan through the dining room and into the living room, staring at the broken planks across the windows. A table lamp underneath one window is on its side. A picture hanging below a mounted baseball bat is askew, but otherwise the room is untouched. Graham lays Morgan gently down on the sofa. Bo comes back in. She does a little dance. She swings her arms and thrusts her hips. He looks down at Morgan. He heads to the cupboard under the stairs. Graham unplugs the set and wields the TV trolley down the hallway into the living room. He maneuvers it into position and crouches down to plug it in. He stares in horror at the reflection on the screen, a tall humanoid form silhouetted against the window, holding Morgan across one of its arms. Graham slowly stands and turns round to face the creature. Merrill comes in from the dining room and stops in his tracks, dropping the syringe. Merrill steps forward. The creature, with its highly domed head, stares between the two men. Graham looks at the alien's lower arm, which is wrapped around Morgan's back and matches his shirt fabric. Two of the creature's four clawed digits are missing. Graham remembers using the knife outside Ray's pantry. The alien holds its other hand out over Morgan's face, tilting its hand up at the wrist joint. A sharp spike slides out of the bottom of the wrist, the alien holding it above Morgan's nose. Merrill, Graham, and Bo stand rooted to the spot, staring in abject horror as the alien looks down at Morgan and then up at Graham. Graham studies the creature with its smooth-skinned earless head, an odd-shaped mouth, dull gray teeth exposed. He glares into the alien's hooded eyes as he remembers driving to the scene of the accident, Caroline in the road waving her arms. Graham narrows his eyes slightly as he remembers crouching by the front of Ray's pickup, his wife's head resting on the bonnet.",
    "1": "Jane looks at us and sits up as we're flying above suburban America, descending slowly toward a tree-lined street. We're looking down at a king-sized bed from overhead: Lester Burnham lies sleeping amidst expensive bed linens, face down, wearing pajamas. An irritating alarm clock rings, and Lester gropes blindly to shut it off. He rolls over, looks up at us, and sighs, then sits up and puts on his slippers. Lester thrusts his face directly into a steaming hot shower, and from outside the shower, his naked body is silhouetted through the fogged-up glass door; it becomes apparent he is masturbating. Close on a single, dewy American Beauty rose, a gloved hand with clippers appears and snips the flower off as Carolyn Burnham tends her rose bushes in front of the Burnham house. A very well-put-together woman of forty, she wears color-coordinated gardening togs and has lots of useful and expensive tools, while Lester watches her through a window on the first floor, peeping out through the drapes. In the fenced front yard of the house next door, a dog barks repeatedly, and a man in a conservative suit (Jim #1) chastises the barking dog. A second man in a conservative suit (Jim #2) comes out of the house as Lester watches all this from the window. Jim #1 walks toward the fence to greet Carolyn, and they continue to chat, unaware that Lester is watching them. Jane is seated at her desk, working at her computer when outside, a car horn blares. Jane stuffs items into her bag and studies herself in a mirror, shifts to get a good profile of her breasts, then shuffles out of the house, her backpack slung over her shoulder. Lester hurries out the front door, carrying a briefcase. Jane gets in the car, and Lester's briefcase suddenly springs open, spilling papers all over the driveway. He drops to his knees to gather everything as Carolyn looks down at us contemptuously but also bored, as if she gave up expecting anything more long ago. Lester smiles sheepishly, trying to lighten the moment as Carolyn drives with Jane staring out the window and Lester asleep in the back seat. He's later staring at a computer monitor and talking on a headset phone, with a beleaguered expression on his face at odds with the light, friendly tone of his voice. Lester sits at his workstation, a beige cubicle surrounded by identical beige cubicles, when Brad, a dapper man in his thirties, approaches and observes Lester, who is unaware of his presence. Lester disconnects the call, obviously irritated, turns around, and smiles perfunctorily. Brad, seated behind his desk in his big corner office, faces Lester, who sits across from him, looking small and isolated.",
    "861": "Underwater, a French tricolor is visible. A wooden galleon is being hauled into a dry dock in rough seas, listing heavily to its starboard side. Lines of men in the dry dock pull on heavy ropes attached to the ship, with those in the center waist-high in water. Others are positioned at higher levels. The men are scruffy, unshaven prisoners who grunt as they pull in unison, with rough, chained hands moving the rope. A grave-looking man in a blue uniform named Javert watches from above on the quay side, staring intently at one particular prisoner who avoids his gaze. The ship is now in the dock, and the prisoners begin to file out. Javert stops one, the same prisoner he had been watching closely. This tall prisoner, who has a beard, closely-cropped hair, and a stoop, turns back from a broken flagpole on the ground. Another prisoner is stopped from following him. The flagpole is long and thick, and the prisoner heaves, squatting and raising one end onto his shoulder. He struggles to his feet and, grimacing, lumbers forward under Javert's cold gaze. The flag, still attached to the pole, drags through the water as the prisoner reaches Javert and drops the pole. Javert's eyes remain fixed on Valjean, who staggers away from the dry dock. Valjean, using a stout staff, plods across rocky terrain towards a cross on a mountain summit. He passes the cross and looks ahead as the sun begins to rise. He walks up a snow-covered hillside, silhouetted against the skyline, with a satchel over his shoulder. Stepping onto a ledge, he glances at the mountains and stops by a farmer upon seeing men at work. The farmer reads them as Valjean removes his woolen hat. As Valjean leaves, a fleshy-jowled town hall officer speaks to a guard. On the street, children throw stones at Valjean, who later warms his hands at a fire in an inn. Valjean is then attacked outside, punched, and kicked. Wandering through a churchyard, he lies down by the church, where something startles him: a bishop holding a lamp. Valjean frowns, then crouches by a blazing fire and eats at a table, shoveling food. He stops momentarily to stare at the bishop and two women by the table. On his feet, he watches as one woman places silverware in a cupboard. Later, lying in bed, he stares up at the ornate ceiling before going to the cupboard. As the bishop sleeps, Valjean stuffs silverware into his satchel.",
    "877": "Nick gives Paula a look and then takes the plate of spaghetti over to where Kate is sitting at the far end of the table and sets it down in front of her. As Leah and Bernadette hungrily tuck into their food, they watch Nick and Kate, who, while doing a crossword in the paper, sticks a pencil into her neat bun and takes a mouthful of the pasta. She looks up at Nick petulantly as he walks back over to Paula. Kate glares at Nick, then, with a face like thunder, stands up and storms out. In her office, Kate slices a menu in half and gets back to her paperwork. Later, in the busy kitchen, she goes over to Nick, who dips a spoon into a pan and holds it out for Kate to taste, but Kate has her own spoon and walks off. Nick tries the sauce and looks pleased, later stirring another pan. Nick smiles as he chats with Leah, while Kate notices the two of them talking and looks over at them disapprovingly. Leah throws her head back and laughs, causing Nick to catch Kate's eye and hold out a pan offering her a taste of the food he's cooking, but she shakes her head dismissively and wanders off. A selection of mouth-watering desserts are arranged neatly on gleaming, white plates, including a circular chocolate pud garnished with raspberries, a delicate chocolate teardrop topped with a swirl of cream, and an immaculate fruit tart. Kate uses a blowtorch to caramelize a fourth dessert, then turns away from her workspace and almost collides with Nick, who puts a plate down on the worktop and picks up a squeezy bottle of dessert sauce. Kate picks up another bottle and begins to decorate a plate, briefly looking up at him. She picks up a delicate spun-sugar cage and gently positions it over a white chocolate mousse on a bed of sliced strawberries, as Nick watches over her shoulder, unnerving her. She breaks the cage, then picks up the dessert plate and a plate containing a second sugar cage, and moves to the other side of the worktop, as Nick stares at her contemplatively. She walks off to the walk-in fridge, where Bernadette hurries out. Kate leans wearily against a shelving unit and looks up as Nick enters the fridge and walks up to her, but she looks away from him. Nick removes his apron, and they leave the fridge. Kate turns to Leah, who looks back at her pleadingly, and then eyes Nick coolly before turning on the blowtorch. Nick walks off past her as Kate absentmindedly holds the blowtorch to her side, causing a tea towel tucked into her apron to catch fire, which she throws to the floor and stamps out.",
    "1068": "Drover, Magarri, and Goolaj gallop across a plain while Japanese fighters fly over Mission Island. One plane dives down towards it, and squatting in his cell, King George raises his head and looks up. On the beach on the island, Nullah looks skywards as four planes peel away from the mass of fighters and swoop towards him. Sarah walks into the army operations room and looks at Cath with concern, while Nullah continues to stare at the planes. King George stands in his cell as the planes dive towards the children on the beach, and Nullah's eyes widen with fear as he sprints across the beach just as bombs fall on the Mission. A priest hurries to the radio hut, but a plane targets it, and as the bomb obliterates the radio shack, King George looks out through the barred window of his cell. Fletcher signs the contract to buy Faraway Downs, then turns and walks out onto the balcony surrounding his office at the top of a high clock tower. Dutton pauses, hearing the noise as fighters appear in the sky over Darwin. On his balcony, Fletcher watches the approaching black dots in the air as planes peel off from the formation to start their attack. Sarah stands up and slowly removes her headset as she stares out of the window, and then a bomb explodes just outside, engulfing her in smoke, flame, and flying glass. The planes, with the red rising sun on their wings, swoop and dive across the town, as soldiers desperately try to get organized. A bomb bursts outside the prison and fire billows into King George's cell, prompting Captain Dutton to bellow orders as policemen let prisoners out of their cells. Soldiers climb into a truck while King George walks out of the prison. As the soldiers stand helpless in their truck and smoke billows over the town, King George walks slowly out through the burning prison gates. A bomb scores a direct hit on a ship, causing fire and black smoke to erupt from the superstructure, while pillars of fire leap skywards as the bombs fall. King George stands and watches the destruction rage all around him, the old magic-man staring around impassively at the plumes of fire and bomb bursts, as the planes continue to completely obliterate the town. The Drover and Magarri sit on their horses amid the smoke and blazing buildings, with Drover staring in shock at the carnage. Fires blaze in the darkness as a pall of smoke covers the town. The burning building collapses as they ride to find Sarah. The Carney house is ablaze, with firefighters vainly trying to tackle it. Drover's eyes widen in horror as a group of men restrain him from walking into the blaze, and Captain Dutton looks in shock at the stretcher his men brought in.",
    "948": "The shadow of a boy cycling a bike with a dumpy alien in the handlebar basket passes in front of a full moon. A small robot races back and forth through long grass, under a cloudy sky. The robot stops and blinks. Sparks shower in the Lillian Steel Foundry. A detached house on a snowy street has a police car on the drive, and a boy, Joe Lamb, sits on a swing in the garden. He's about 14 and glumly looks down at a locket that he's holding. A wake is being held inside the house. Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk look at Joe through the window. Some other boys stand by a buffet table. An American 1970s yellow Coupe with a black vinyl roof pulls up outside the house. Joe, from the swing, watches as a good-looking man with shoulder-length blonde hair, Lewis, gets out of the car, glances at Joe, adjusts his hair, and goes into the house. Joe watches as his dad, Jack, bundles Lewis outside and shoves him into the back of the police car on the drive. Jack, a dark-haired man of about 40, sees an apprehensive Joe watching him, then gets in the patrol car and drives it off with its lights flashing. Joe watches as it disappears up the road and looks back down at the locket he's holding before snapping it shut. Excited pupils spill out of Lillian Middle School as it closes for the summer holidays, bicycles are taken out of a bike rack, and Joe is amongst the throng of pupils. One boy from the wake, Charles, comes over to him. Joe looks shocked, as in their movie, a boy, Martin, plays a detective character while another boy, Cary, is a zombie. Martin pulls a gun, but Cary knocks it from his hand. They tussle, and Martin shoves Cary back onto some spikes on the wall, impaling him as blood spills from Cary's mouth while Joe and Charles watch. Joe leaves, and Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk exchange a look. Outside, Joe cycles across the quiet residential street to his house where Jack's patrol car is on the drive. Joe goes inside, makes his way through the kitchen to the living room, and finds his father weeping in the bathroom and shuts the door on the shocked Joe. Later, Jack and Joe are at a table in Carol's Diner. As they eat, Jack hands Joe a leaflet, and Joe looks unconvinced while Jack takes a pull on a bottle of beer and regards Joe sincerely before turning his attention to the pamphlet.",
    "1035": "Ryan and Kara go to the Sunday School room, where Ryan peers through a window in the door. Inside, Jim is sitting in suit trousers, a white shirt, and a maroon waistcoat, reading a children's book. Ryan turns to Kara, who raises her eyebrows, urging him to go in. Jim looks up from the book, and Ryan shuts the door, his eyes roving before he sits down and shrugs. Jim nods and raises his eyebrows, while Ryan smiles and Kara, watching, smiles back. Kara ushers Jim into the room where Julie sits being consoled by the other bridesmaids. Jim walks over to Julie, kneels down, takes her hands in his, and she smiles and nods before they hug each other. Watching from the doorway, Kara glances at Ryan as an usher hands guests the order of service, and they take their seats in the church. In the vestry, Alex helps Ryan get into his suit, and they sit watching as flower girls walk down the aisle, while Jim stands waiting with the bridesmaids. Everyone looks around as Julie walks down the aisle, arm-in-arm with Jim's uncle, and then Julie and Jim walk up to the priest, who conducts the ceremony. Everyone stands watching as Jim slips the wedding ring onto Julie's finger, and she beams. Ryan sits with Alex's hand in his as Julie and Jim light candles. Jim lifts Julie's veil, they kiss, and everyone applauds as Julie and Jim walk up the aisle, arm-in-arm, with Julie waving her bouquet. Everyone lines up outside for photographs, and later, at the reception, Julie and Jim dance together while guests wave tiny wedding bells. Alex and Ryan smile and laugh together, and Julie and Ryan dance cheek-to-cheek as the dance floor fills. Alex and Ryan dance together, with him pulling a goofy face and falling back into her arms, then they play pat-a-cake. Ryan looks serious and waggles his arms while Alex shimmies from side to side. Julie tosses her bouquet over her shoulder, and one of the bridesmaids catches it. Later, Alex and Ryan slow dance together, and as the guests start to leave, they sit together with Ryan handing Alex a bouquet of flowers, making her crack up. Ryan helps Alex on with her jacket, and they leave. In the hotel lift, Alex and Ryan kiss, and the next day, at the airport, they face each other smiling while holding their wheelie cases. Alex's smile drops for a moment, and she walks off as Ryan watches her head to her Departure gate. In Omaha, Ryan walks along the hall and lets himself into his apartment, stops for a moment in the sparse white room, opens the closet to hang up some shirts, and in the bathroom, puts his toothbrush in a glass. Finally, with Natalie, Ryan walks along a line of cubicles where workers talk to people on video links.",
    "1268": "A blast deflects onto the ceiling, bringing stone beams down onto the stair as Harry steadies himself with a Basilisk fang in hand. Voldemort spots Harry and fires, causing him to fall onto a lower staircase and drop the fang, which Voldemort destroys. Harry then disappears from Voldemort's sight as the Dark Lord dis-apparates. Nagini slithers across a landing, is hit by a stone, and turns to look over the edge of the stairs where Hermione stands alone and throws another stone as Nagini descends. The unconscious Neville comes to, sits up woozily, and is oblivious to the mayhem of battle around him, even as a burning body floats past. He turns his head and sees the Sword of Gryffindor on the ground behind him. Voldemort lands and takes aim as the walkway collapses, causing Harry to drop to the floor below. As Harry scrabbles away, strips of Voldemort's black cloak twist around his wrists and neck, restraining him, and Voldemort reins him in. Nagini advances on Hermione, who retreats with a basilisk fang in hand, while Ron also wielding a fang creeps up the stairs towards the snake, which turns on him, causing him to escape but drop the fang. The snake rears up between Ron and Hermione. In another part of the school, Bellatrix and Ginny are dueling until Molly takes Ginny's place. On a narrow platform, they exchange energy blasts with Bellatrix seemingly having the upper hand, but Molly advances wildly and strikes Bellatrix several times. The stunned Death Eater raises her hands in the air, and Molly wields her wand once more, causing Bellatrix to explode into tiny black fragments, after which Molly grins. On the walkway, Voldemort uses physical strength against Harry, slapping and kicking him as Harry scuttles backwards. High on the ramparts, Harry flings his arms around Voldemort's neck and jumps off the edge with him. They plummet from the heights, struggling for supremacy, clawing at each other and soaring above the school. Harry seems to split Voldemort's head in two, revealing only black smoke, and as they land in the courtyard, they roll away from each other across the cobbles, lying on the ground some distance apart. Energy spent, each crawls towards his wand, with Voldemort reaching the Elder Wand just before Harry reaches his. On their knees, they fire at each other, with a burst of green energy from the Elder Wand meeting a burst of red from Harry, resulting in a bright white ball of light. Inside, Nagini chases Hermione and Ron downstairs, and as they fall, Nagini raises her head with her mouth open.",
    "1284": "Helen and her escort walk past two agents pushing an empty wheelchair towards Klaatu's room as the lift doors slide open. Inside the lift is Klaatu in a wheelchair with four agents, manacled to the chair, and pushed down a passageway with pipes lining one wall. He's pushed into a room where the agent bringing up the rear checks the passageway before entering and closing the door. The room is large, with a man in glasses sitting at a table covered with electronic equipment, and Klaatu is pushed up to the table. Electrodes are placed around his body and attached to his temples, and the operator activates the polygraph. The agents leave the room and join others standing guard outside at regular intervals along the walls of the corridor. The man studies his equipment as the operator stares at the electronic traces on his flickering screen. Klaatu turns to look at the man, while the polygraph operator stares fixedly at his screen through glasses perched on the end of his nose as his screen blurs and distorts. Needles trace wave patterns on scrolling graph paper, and Klaatu eyes the interrogator steadily. The man returns his stare with a frown, then reaches out to his console, and is thrown backwards by the charge. Half lying under the table, he twitches, then slowly slides back upright, staring blankly. Klaatu focuses his vision down the electrode cables, wiring to a security camera overlooking an agent standing guard, then channels through to another camera and another guard. Two more suited agents walk along the corridor as Klaatu closes his eyes. The agents clamp their hands over their earpieces, and all collapse to the floor in agony. Still seated but wearing a suit, Klaatu looks up as the lights flicker and the power fluctuates all over the building. Helen looks up in alarm, then puts on her coat and grabs the sample of Klaatu's fatty outer skin. The alien, now standing, turns to the catatonic polygraph operator sitting in his underwear, removes the electrodes, and the operator collapses on the table. Klaatu strides down the corridor past the agents who are still writhing in agony while Helen, glancing around warily, runs down a corridor full of shadows cast by the flickering lights. Klaatu enters the lift, walks down a railway line in an industrial area, with flame flaring from a stack at a refinery behind him, and arrives on a railway station platform. In slow motion, he walks alongside a train, then into the busy station concourse. He walks calmly through the teeming crowds and looks up at the departures board where all the trains are delayed. A guy with a beard jostles through the crowd and snatches a ticket from a man's pocket as he brushes past him.",
    "447": "The raincoats swaying slowly. The camera approaches one of them. From the pocket projects a bottle of whiskey. He is wiping his parched mouth. He puts the handkerchief back. He fishes the coat check from his pocket, buries it in his fist, fighting the foolish impulse. He rises and, to the irritation of his neighbors, leaves his seat amid some disapproving shushings from the row behind. He puts the check on the counter. The attendant looks up from a newspaper. The attendant takes the check and leaves. Don rolls his program and sticks it into the sand of the cuspidor. The attendant returns. The attendant holds a short leopard coat and a lady's small umbrella. Don looks. Don's nervousness is mounting. He is biting his lips, unable to find another argument. He shoves the leopard coat and umbrella close to Don. The attendant has returned to the other end of the counter and resumed his doze. He takes his coat rather brusquely, thrusts the leopard coat at her. Don takes the coat, feels it hurriedly to make sure the bottle is still there, and starts away. Helen is left with the leopard coat and his bowler. Don comes back, takes the hat, starts away again. His patience exhausted, Don stops again, takes the umbrella and tosses it in Helen's direction. Helen, who is getting into her coat, can't catch it. It falls right next to her. Don stands abashed. He goes back, picks up the umbrella. As they go on talking, they walk from the cloak room, through the vestibule, to the street, Don carrying his coat over his arm. There is a split second of indecision but it is ended by Don's awareness of the bottle in his raincoat. He is unfurling his raincoat in order to put it on before he steps from under the marquee. Helen is about a step and a half away when there is a crash. On the sidewalk lies the pint of whiskey, broken. She stops and looks down, as does Don. She goes. Don looks at the broken bottle, then after Helen. With sudden decision he calls after her. It is dark and the rain has settled to a drizzle. He joins her, takes the umbrella out of her hand and holds it over them both as they go down the street. As we have left it, empty save for Nat and Don. Sunlight outside. Nat is now taking the chairs from the tables and arranging the bar for the afternoon and evening trade, while Don leans back against the bar, the jigger of whiskey in his hand, and goes on talking. Don drinks. It is filled with the routine activity of a big commercial hotel on a hot summer day.",
    "264": "Gale and Evelle, both covered in blue, are screaming in rage, fear, and incomprehension as blue dollar bills snap and flutter around the inside of the car. The car is swerving wildly as Gale drives blind, with the inside of the windshield covered with blue paint. He reaches forward to wipe clear a patch of windshield, and as the blue paint is smeared away, we see Hi and Ed's car parked broadside in the middle of the road. Hi and Ed are in front of it, with Hi aiming his scatter gun and Ed a revolver. Ed runs over to Gale and Evelle's car, throws open the back door to look for the baby, but comes out only with Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Evelle is staggering around in shock, looking in disbelief at his own blue body. Hi and Ed climb into their car and peel out. Sitting placidly in his car seat in the middle of the road in front of a bank is Nathan Jr. As the camera focuses on Nathan Jr., it booms up to show the empty street beyond him while the crack of return fire and furiously squealing brakes are heard, culminating in a loud explosion that snaps off the siren wail. The police car is apparently history, and beyond the crest of the road ahead, a ball of flame has leapt up with the explosion. As the explosion echoes and fades, the deep rumble of an approaching engine is heard, and Lenny Smalls' motorcycle appears over the rise. Framed against fire and smoke, he is coming directly toward us and the baby. As they top a rise from the other direction, we see the baby sitting in the middle of the street, with Lenny fast approaching from the background. The extremely low wide shot, locked down to the speeding bike, shows us rushing toward the rear of Nathan Jr.'s car seat. With a clank of chains, Lenny's hand drops down into frame, palm forward, tensing to scoop up the car seat that we are almost upon. In a low shot with Nathan Jr. in the foreground, he is scooped up and out of frame as Lenny roars by. Roaring along, Lenny hooks the car seat over his handlebars. Approaching, Lenny saws a shotgun out of his back holster and levels it at the oncoming car, sighting down the gun and swinging it around as he approaches the car. The shotgun spits orange flame, and the windshield explodes in as Lenny roars by, with the baby on the handlebars in the foreground and the road rushing by beyond him. The bike banks into a hard turn, shooting through where the windshield used to be, cutting in at the end of the skid as the car rocks to a halt.",
    "603": "Draco is in a cluttered room, he pauses, looks around, tossing an apple, and turns as he hears creaking behind him. He hauls down a heavy cloth cover, revealing a tall triangular cabinet similar to the one in Borgin and Burke shop, and studies it closely. A lone student flies over the Quidditch stadium as Harry and Ginny stand facing the Gryffindor triallists, who all turn toward them. Ron stands stiffly wearing a protective leather helmet, and from the stands, Hermione waves to him. Cormac swaggers up to Ron, catches a fly, slaps Ron's arm, and marches off, leaving Ron looking miserable. Cormac flies confidently towards a circular goalpost as Ron almost slips off his broomstick heading for the opposing goal, watched closely by Lavender. Cormac smirks, catching Hermione's eye, and she glances away, then back as the trials begin and two players collide and fall. Holding a round leather Quaffle, Ginny aims it at Cormac's goal; he punches it away with his right hand, kicks another, and punches a third with his left hand before grabbing hold of the next Quaffle. It's Ron's turn to protect his goal; he punches and kicks out wildly, deflecting shots, but a Quaffle unseats him, leaving him dangling from the end of his broomstick as Lavender gets up on her feet rooting for him. Ron regains his seat on the broomstick, and watched by Hermione, clings on anxiously as two chasers zoom past Harry and Cormac smirks confidently. Hermione whispers into her hand, smiles as Cormac is jerked sideways, and the Quaffle flies past him through the goal. A Quaffle aimed at Ron hits his head and bounces away as he swings helplessly. In the Gryffindor common room, Hermione pulls a face as Ron glances at Lavender, who waves to him and glares at Ron. Harry closes it and gets up, Ginny grabs it from him, Hermione and Ginny stare at Harry who shifts awkwardly, Ginny tosses the book back, and Harry walks away as both girls watch him leave. In his room, Harry sits at a table with the book open in front of him, notes scribbled all over its pages. Walking in the snow, Flitwick passes the trio near the Three Broomsticks where Harry sees Draco, who walks out. Ron spots Ginny with Dean Thomas, Hermione looks over at them as Ginny and Dean kiss at their corner table. Ron turns, clenches his jaw, scowls at Harry, leans on the table, raises his eyebrows, glances at Hermione, and points to his upper lip. Hermione wipes the butterbeer froth from her lip with her sleeve, then gazes at Ron, and on the way back, Leanne and Katie are walking ahead of them.",

The PATH over the SUMMIT is in FULL VIEW of the ORCS. FRODO stays CLOSE to the ROCK WALL, masked by SHADOWS. Behind FRODO, SHELOB APPEARS! With hideous STEALTH, she follows FRODO. FRODO slowly climbing the STONE STAIRS, his GAZE and CONCENTRATION on the ORC TOWER. Behind him, SHELOB lurches into a HORRIBLE SCUTTLE down the SHEER ROCK FACE. FRODO suddenly senses the LURKING MALICE. He SPINS AROUND: Before he can react, SHELOB VICIOUSLY STABS FRODO in the NECK with her monstrous abdominal STINGER! FRODO instantly goes LIMP.

    "291": "Jeff is sitting on the wheelchair near the bar, a drink in his hand. He starts to take a sip from the glass when Lisa comes out of the kitchen. She is an ethereal beauty, in a sheer peach nightgown, covered by a gossamer matching kimono. She turns gracefully in front of Jeff, and he lowers his drink. Instead of increasing her sobbing, this news quiets, momentarily, the woman who owned the dog. Her hands go down to the railing of the fire escape, gripping it fiercely. The guests at the songwriter's party begin to move silently back to the studio apartment, and the people move off their balcony into the apartment. The woman almost screams at the people now, as she looks up at the apartment. The husband leans over the fire escape and motions Miss Lonely Hearts to place the dog in the basket, which is already lowered. Miss Lonely Hearts puts the dog in the basket and watches as the husband draws it slowly up. The dog moves closer to the fire escape, slowly, the husband pulling the rope in hand over hand. The dog reaches the fire escape, and the husband tenderly takes it out of the basket. She breaks out sobbing anew and returns to her apartment and out of sight, the crying growing fainter with her retreat. He turns to carry it into the apartment. The newlyweds draw their shades again. The landlord moves away from the window. Miss Torso goes back to her apartment. Miss Hearing Aid turns down the volume of her hearing aid and goes back to her apartment. Jeff and Lisa are at the window, and he is holding one of her hands. Jeff speaks without looking up. Thorwald's apartment. The only light that can be seen in it is the glowing end of a cigar in the center of the room, back from the window -- as if Thorwald was sitting quietly on his sofa, smoking. Lisa looks down at Jeff. He nods solemnly and then turns back to the window, as both he and Lisa look again towards the dark apartment, with only the unmoving glow of a cigar showing in the center. Thorwald's apartment. Jeff, Stella, and Lisa are grouped at the window, looking out. The camera is behind them. Jeff holds the long-focus lens to his eye. In the bathroom, Thorwald is wiping the enameled wall with a damp cloth. He rubs at particular spots now and then. We see the upper part of the bedroom window, belonging to Thorwald. The lower part of the window is covered by a wall. Over this, we hear. Jeff lowers the camera with a long-focus lens. We now see their faces. Neither he nor Lisa makes any comment.",
    "1304": "Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her, kneels down, and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms. The woman smiles for the first time and hands him the wrapped child. The doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him while the woman, unable to see her baby, watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child. The doctor finally glances up, looking shaken, and makes eye contact with the woman for only a second, causing a chill to go through her body. He looks to the three saleswomen in the room, his hard stare unsettling them, and the older saleswoman speaks up. Everyone becomes very still, the mother looks like she stopped breathing, and the baby screams. The doctor whispers something we can't hear, looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in, and Mathison turns back to the mother. The woman looks over the one being offered and then points to the Sports Illustrated peeking out of the seat pocket, and David pulls the magazine out and gives it to her. David waits until the opposing train passes. The woman goes back to her magazine, and Kelly looks up from her Sports Illustrated, her striking blue eyes gazing at David. She holds up her hand, taps the diamond ring on her finger, leading to an awkward silence. Kelly gets up, balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles, and starts to the back of the car, leaving David sitting alone looking like he's drowning, but there's no water. David feels a stare, glancing up to see the little girl spying on him from between the seats. He leans towards the window to avoid eye contact, his hand reaching into his coat to slide out his wedding band, which he puts back on. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed, and his head bounces lightly against the window, but the shaking of the glass never allows his eyes to completely close. He sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger and looks out the window, where the scenery blurs as it flies by. David turns, noticing some of the other passengers reacting as the train picks up speed, with the normal bumps of the tracks becoming amplified and the train going faster. David's eyes move to the seat in front of him to find the little girl no longer watching him. David looks to the passengers across from him, seeing the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as a boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down, his floppy brown hair spreading out in a circle in front of his red face.",
    "373": "Young Jenny Hill watches barefoot Edward leave Spectre for the first time. Finally realizing who this woman is, before he can say anything more, Edward pulls the door shut behind him as he leaves, but it breaks off in his hands. Inside, Jenny looks out, surprised and annoyed. Edward tries to lift the door back on the hinges, but they snap off. The door frame buckles and the whole shack creaks. He tries to lean the door against the frame, but it keeps slipping. He leans the door a different way; it holds for a beat then falls in, smashing a small table. Karl pushes against the side of the house until it fits. Holding nails between his lips, Edward puts in new windows himself, a white picket fence. In every detail, it is impossibly charming. Edward is screwing a hat rack into the wall in the foyer while Jenny leans against the doorframe, listening to his story and watching him with deepest affection. Finished with his work, he takes his hat off the chair and hangs it on the rack. Perfect. A look between them. With that last job done, there's no reason for him to be staying any longer. Does she really mean it? She comes closer, but Edward holds his ground. She takes his hand, lifting his hat up to the peg. She's very close—just a half-inch from kissing him when—Edward gently holds her back. She freezes, stunned and humiliated, then pulls away. With that, he begins to leave. She finds a pen and hastily signs the deed to the house, handing it to him. With a look, he thanks her, then goes. Edward takes a final look at this perfect little town. He climbs in his car and starts the engine. As we watch, the swamp begins to overtake the house, swallowing it in a tangle of vines and mossy branches. Shoots burst up through the planks in the porch. Snakes slither through the marsh. Day becomes night. Will and Jenny are still sitting at her table, a pitcher of iced tea between them. Will smiles to hear it called that. Jenny is working herself into more of a state by not talking. Angle on Will, sorting through his swirling thoughts, he turns to see his wife at a payphone. She hangs up. She was calling him. How can she answer? He half-smiles, realizing the idiocy of his question. Of course, his father's not going to be okay. Dr. Bennett smiles as he checks Edward's chart. A long silence, just the sounds of the hospital, doctors being paged. Will half-smiles. Patting Will's shoulder, Dr. Bennett leaves. We stay on Will and his father for a long time, then Will takes his pen and starts making a list.",

Other owners look at John, and with a smile, the tanned bikini beauty unclips the leash on her pet boxer. Others follow suit and a huge Rottweiler charges into the surf. John grins as the dogs play together in the shallows and more join the fun. An owner throws a Frisbee for his border collie. John grins as the dogs splash around. Bikini girl looks concerned. Marley is circling in the shallows, preparing to poop. Other owners watch in horror. The big Rottweiler owner closes his eyes in shocked disbelief as John lunges for Marley. The big man summons the Rottweiler and a police 4x4 noses onto the beach. The officers, in shorts and ball caps, get out of the vehicle. At night, John arrives home in the Volvo with Marley. Marley and John enter the darkened house. Grinning with embarrassed delight, John scoops up Connor as his two boys run forward to greet him. Jenny comes forward, holding Colleen and kisses him and brings in a huge square cake covered in candles. Marley immediately puts his paws on the table and starts eating the cake. The pool is covered with floating flower candles. John feeds Marley cake. She takes off her dress and grins, naked, in front of him. He grins as she takes a running jump into the pool. He unbuttons his shirt. He cannonballs in, surfaces and swims towards her. As they cuddle naked, Marley swims past. John's putting items from his desk into a box. He hefts the box under his arm and walks towards Arnie, who's standing outside his office. He pats Arnie on the shoulder and the older man leans forward and gives him a half hug. John walks away, grinning. Their people carrier drives through green fields and lush woodland. Marley is leaning out of the window as the Grogans drive down a country road. Marley bounds up the steps to the large stone-built house and headbutts a stone bird table. He knocked the table off the porch. John's at his desk in the cavernous offices of the Philadelphia Inquirer daily news. John joins the kids and Marley at the bedroom window. Huge garden is covered in snow. They all pile outside wrapped up for the cold. A snowball fight starts, then Jenny and John pull the children on a sledge while Marley trots alongside. Little Colleen falls off. Marley attacks their snowman. John looks at his wife, then they smile and hug. John walks upstairs and switches off the lights. He looks in on sleeping Colleen, then checks on the boys in their bunks.",
    "1376": "Ron gasps as Hermione storms off, and Harry is walking up some steps. He reaches the top and bumps into Cho who has come around the corner. Ron is being helped into the room, looking shaky, and he shakes his head as the Patil twins walk past. Ron gets dressed in front of a mirror, looking panicked and uncomfortable in his ridiculous dress robes. Harry walks in dressed in a more conventional suit and sniffs at his clothes. Harry and Ron walk down the stairs into the hall, with Ron fidgeting with his outfit, and they approach the Patil twins. Hermione enters the room all dressed up, walks down the stairs, and Viktor Krum takes her hand as they walk together and dance. Soon others join in, including Dumbledore and McGonagall, Mr. Filch and his cat, and Hagrid and Madame Maxime, while Mad-Eye Moody sits on the sidelines drinking. The crowd is jumping, but Harry, Ron, and their dates sit some distance away looking miserable. Hermione comes up after a great time with Viktor and then walks off. Harry walks up, and he and Ron walk away. They return to the old house, where a sleeve is rolled up to reveal a marking of a skull and snake on the arm, and Harry wakes up. Floorboards creak as someone walks up to his bed, and he chuckles and dances off. Harry nods as he takes his clothes off and gets in the bath, with his golden egg on the side. The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around, gets in the water, and laughs, embarrassing Harry. Mad-Eye Moody appears in the doorway as Neville emerges from behind a bookcase. The Weasley twins shout and take bets as Harry walks along with Neville, carrying green plant life in hand. Harry puts the gillyweed in his mouth and starts choking when the cannon fires and the champions enter the water, with three diving in while Harry is pushed. Underwater, the effects of gillyweed take hold, making Harry's hands and feet webbed. Harry flies into the air like a dolphin to the crowd’s cheers, then swims among the fish and rocks, still searching. He finds Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons tied by their ankles. Cedric takes Cho with him, and Harry sets about freeing Ron and Hermione as vicious merpeople appear. What looks like a shark approaches at high speed, but it has legs, revealing it's Viktor, who takes Hermione and heads for the surface.",
    "63": "At this question, he rises and looks through the doorway. Escobar sees him and ignores him. Evelyn looks up to see Gittes standing in the doorway only a foot or two from her, and she stops cold. Escobar is right at her back. They look at one another for a long moment, and Gittes says nothing. She finishes, looks plaintively at Gittes, and Evelyn nods slightly as Escobar coughs. Gittes picks up the sheet and pulls it back, revealing eyes open and a face that is badly cut and bruised. They begin to walk slowly, and again have to move out of the way as some other corpse is being wheeled out of one of the Coroner cubicles. Morty is wheeling in another body with the help of an assistant. Morty pulls back the sheet, brushes some sand from the man's face, and laughs. As he begins to move the body into the refrigerator, he breaks into a wrenching spasm of coughing and Morty shrugs. The Boy doesn't answer, but then nods. The horse snorts, and The Boy rides slowly on. Gittes scrambles up the embankment to note the direction the storm drain by Hollenbeck Bridge takes. It is headed above toward the Hollywood Hills, where the sun is setting, along the flood channel. It is dark now and Gittes follows the channel with the car spotlight. The road is dirt, with heavy clusters of oak trees and eucalyptus everywhere. Another turn reveals a pie-shaped view of a lake of lights in the city below, over the road, bolted. He turns at a fork in the road which allows him to continue following the flood channel. The road is narrower and Gittes drives more slowly. The chain-link itself actually extends over the flood channel and down into it, making access along the channel itself impossible. Gittes backs up, turns off the motor, the car lights, and the spotlight. Alone light overhead on tension wires is the sole illumination. Gittes gets out of the car, clubs the fence near the Flood channel itself. Lights from the reservoir still higher above can be seen. Gittes carefully works his way up through the thick foliage toward a second and large chain-link fence. He dives into the flood control channel, which is at this point about four feet deep and six feet wide. Gittes loses himself among the ivy in the channel and starts to lift his head to catch the direction. Then he's inundated with a rush of water which pours over him, knocks off his hat, and carries him down the channel, banging into its banks, as he desperately tries to grab some of the overgrowth to hang on and pull himself out, but the force of the stream batters him and carries him with it until he's brought rudely to the chain-link fence.",

He then stands watching a row of lockers, where Yayo, now soaked with sweat, is still here, and he stares at one of them as we push in. He starts to move for it, then looks off, and we tilt down to her ankle, noticing a bulge, while we quickly tilt down to the guy's ankle, noticing a similar bulge. She is dressed casually in slacks and a blouse, tapping to some unheard rhythm with what looks like a bulge near the ankle. He lights a cigarette, looks off screen, and freezes as Yayo leans against the railing, giving a look at the Bear. Bo Catlett leans on the railing, looking down at Yayo again, and Bear looks at him as Chili points to a star on the map. They both look to the front door where a tall, skinny woman with wild, jet-black hair stands. Karen starts to answer, but Nicki is already hustling Chili inside, and Chili steps inside to check out some photographs, most of which are of Martin. Way off in the background, there is a view of the huge backyard, which somehow makes Karen feel better. Chili follows her gaze, and we see that he hugs her and hangs on, leaving Nicki and Chili standing there like idiots, while Karen fights a smile, and Nicki nods solemnly. A gardener blows leaves as Martin's extensive photography collection lines the walls, done in cracked oils, the whole bit, while Martin, Karen, and Chili all sit on white couches. Martin is checking out Karen, nodding, and brings his hand back, nodding, lost in thought, while Karen looks like she wants to throw up, ready to give up. Martin cracks himself up, and Karen and Chili crack up with him, Karen leaning into Chili, as Chili watches the movie star hunch over, narrowing his shoulders but keeps looking at Martin. Karen shakes her head as for a few moments he holds his hands together in front of him, getting a shifty look in his eyes, and she looks away, fighting a smile. Karen watches as Martin stares at Chili, his expression gradually becoming deadpan and sleepy, and Martin nods, giving Chili a nice dead-eyed look, while Chili exchanges a look with Karen, who sits back now thoroughly enjoying Chili's manipulation of Martin. Chili sits back, and Karen is starting to enjoy Chili's handling of Martin, as she looks at Martin and shakes her head, then looks at Chili as he sits back, while Martin looks at Chili. Harry looks up to see Bo Catlett, dressed up as usual, standing there with the Bear, who is wearing a Hawaiian shirt.",
    "15": "Lester, still listening, looks like he's about to implode. Jane covers her ears and starts singing to drown her out. Jane's singing stops, and panicked, Lester scurries down the hall. Angela crosses to the window and looks out. We see Angela standing at the window in her underwear, looking down at us. We're across from Jane's window, looking in. We zoom toward her, even as Angela poses in the window; we're clearly not interested in Angela. Finally, we settle on the small make-up mirror where we see a reflection of Jane, back at her computer. Ricky sits in darkness with his digicam, videotaping. She's smiling. Then suddenly the drapes close and she's gone. He lowers the camera and smiles, then something below catches his attention. Through a window on the side of the Burnham's garage door, we see Lester, still in his suit, digging through shelves against the back wall. Lester digs through stuff stored on the shelves, searching for something as if his very life depended on it. Suddenly we hear someone trying to open a locked door. Moving swiftly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and switches on a light. His room is a haven of high-tech. A state-of-the-art multimedia computer crowds his desk, and high-end stereo and video equipment line the shelves, as well as hundreds of CDs. There is easily twenty thousand dollars worth of equipment in this room. Ricky opens the door. The Colonel stands outside, eyeing him. The Colonel holds out a small plastic cup with a cap. He disappears down the hall. Ricky smiles, shuts and locks his door. He puts the plastic cup on the shelf, then crosses to a mini refrigerator in the corner of his room and takes out a cup-sized Tupperware container from the freezer, already filled with urine, albeit frozen, and places it on a saucer to thaw overnight. Carolyn lies sleeping. Lester is awake, staring at the ceiling. After a moment, he gets up, taking care not to disturb Carolyn, and walks toward the bathroom. The room is filled with steam. Lester looks around, confused, then focuses on: Across from us, in a pedestal bathtub, is Angela. Rose petals float on the surface of the water, obscuring her naked body. Lester kneels by the bathtub like a man in church. She arches her back and looks up at him provocatively. Lester gives her a hard look, then slowly slips his hand into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen and she throws her head back. Close on Carolyn, her eyes wide, listening to the rhythmic brush of Lester's hand as he masturbates under the covers. She flips over and faces him. Carolyn gets out of bed, repelled.",
    "1064": "At dawn, an orange glow silhouettes two people and a tree. His grandfather grabs his fishing pole as the boy lies wide-eyed on the bottom while a White man in a suit falls face-first into the water. The man floats lifelessly over the boy, his blood staining the water, and then sinks to the bottom. The boy breaks the surface and sees a horse panicking in the water, reaches out, and the horse swims towards him, allowing him to stroke its muzzle. He climbs on the horse's back, urging it out of the water. Wearing only shorts, with his long hair streaming, he rides through a dusty landscape with thinly spread trees and rocky crags, continuing through a settlement of wood buildings and animal pens. Bonfire smoke mixes with the dust in the air, and an animal skull hangs from a dry branch. Spotting an overloaded truck approaching, he dismounts and looks worried, sprinting through the settlement called Faraway Downs. He hides in a water tank as a man tries to grab the horse, peeking through a crack as an elegant woman in a bonnet and long coat strides towards the house. A woman rides a horse, and a car pulls up at a large country house while a man in a bowler hat gets out. She frowns, her blue eyes glittering, and screws up a telegram, later looking out of an airplane window at a port with a moored ship. A red-bearded speaker is sent sprawling, making the rough-looking crew in a bar nervous; Drover downs a drink and up-ends his glass as an Aboriginal man approaches, while the pipe-smoking barman glares. Coolly, the barman closes the sealing doors as Drover is busy with Bull with the red beard. Meanwhile, Sarah marshals her porters, brushing past disdainfully and striding on. Drover is thrown over the bar but comes up swinging, with the brawl in full swing as Sarah approaches the pub. As she walks in, the fight spills out the back. Upon entering the pub, she notices the barman's raised truncheon and an old drunk in the corner. The barman rolls his eyes as she heads for the door, walking out just as Drover hurls Bull into her luggage. They hit each other with the suitcases, one bursts, sending underwear flying. Carney watches with binoculars as she approaches in horror through the brawlers, rubberneckers, and flying undies. Drover breaks a case over his opponent's head, and Bull goes down. Sarah looks appalled at the exhausted Drover as his black friend gestures that she is behind him.",
    "247": "Brett still can't speak, and Jules savagely tips the card table over, removing the barrier between himself and Brett, who now sits like a political prisoner in front of an interrogator. Jules takes his .45 and presses the barrel hard into Brett's cheek as Brett regresses on the spot. Jules' eyes go to Vincent, who smirks, leading Jules to roll his eyes and shoot Brett in the shoulder. The two men then empty their guns at the same time on the sitting Brett. We fade up on Butch Coolidge, a white, 26-year-old prizefighter, who sits at a table wearing a red and blue high school athletic jacket. Talking to him off-screen is everybody's boss, Marsellus Wallace. A hand lays an envelope full of money on the table in front of Butch, who picks it up. Vincent Vega looks really cool behind the wheel of a 1964 cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. The front entrance is unlocked, revealing the Dapper Dan fellow inside: English Dave. Vincent, carrying the black briefcase from the scene with Jules, steps inside, and English Dave slams the door in our faces. The spacious club is empty this time of day as English Dave crosses to the bar with Vince following. Butch shakes hands with a huge figure with his back to us, the infamous and as of yet still unseen Marsellus. English Dave smiles to himself and puts Vince's coffee in front of him. Butch does a slow turn toward Vincent, and as he turns his body, Vincent walks forward out of frame, never giving Butch another glance, before hugging and kissing the obscured figure that is Marsellus. Butch wisely decides that since this asshole is a friend of Marsellus, he better let it go for now and is snapped out of his ass-kicking thoughts. He pays English Dave and walks out of the shot. A woman who seems to have a fondness for earrings, with both ears pierced five times, and rings in her lips, eyebrows, and nose, is seen. Jody, Vincent, and a young woman named Trudi sit at the kitchen table of a suburban house in Echo Park. Vince has been letting the conversation go through one ear and out the other until the last remark catches his attention. Jody looks at him and states something as if it were the most obvious thing in the world, then continues talking to Trudi, leaving Vincent to ponder the truth of her statement. Vincent takes out a roll of money large enough to choke a horse to death and his case of works (utensils for shooting up) as he cooks his heroin.",
    "1202": "John walks down the front path of the house with a pool and palm trees at the front, where there's a large new car in the driveway. He unsmilingly bends down and picks the newspapers up off the drive. Holding a baby, he snaps at Marley, who's paws up on the breakfast table and taking an interest in Patrick's food. John frowns at the implication, and the moment's captured on camera. He arrives back home at night, driving his old blue Honda and parks up behind their new people carrier. Gloomily, he glances up, and through a window, sees Jenny holding the baby with Marley bouncing around, playfully. He leans back thoughtfully in the driving seat. Jenny spots him sitting in the car and gestures to him, asking if he's actually going to come indoors. He gets reluctantly out of the car. He sits with a blank expression. Jenny and Patrick sit glumly side by side at the table as John goes and sees to the baby. Marley is next to Patrick, eyeing his food, as she's trying to wrestle a book away from him. John shakes his head as Marley savages the book. Later, Jenny tucks the baby into his cot, then goes over to kiss Patrick, who's snug in his little bed. She shuts the blinds and leaves the room, easing the door closed behind her. She walks softly on bare feet to her and John's room, where Marley is lying on the bed. She puts a pillow next to the dog and lies down on her back. Marley lies with his head in her lap, gently wagging his tail. She claps her hands to her face in frustration and stomps to the boys' room as Marley blunders excitedly from one window to another, knocking over a lamp and pulling down a blind in the process. She puts the baby in his high chair, and Marley knocks Patrick over. John gets home, and Marley's chewing a toy on the sofa. He hands a bag of dog food to Sebastian. There's a pile of boxes, and he looks out of the window at the city as Sebastian nods awkwardly. Back home, Jenny's dozing on the sofa when John walks in. He sits opposite her, and she eyes him, shaking her head. He smiles quizzically at her. Jenny's holding a newborn baby, smiling as a nurse pushes her in a wheelchair. Colleen sleeps in a swinging seat as the rest of the family and Marley play ball in the pool. He picks up the phone in the kitchen and walks back outside wearing a towel. John runs on the beach with Marley, and they jog past a tanned young woman in a skimpy bikini. John stops for a breather.",
    "945": "They step into their cabin, where champagne is on ice. Watson sees a woman with the conductor in the corridor, then turns back to Mary, who is smiling as she hands it over. The train speeds through the night, clouds of steam and smoke belching from its funnel as it races along. In their compartment, Watson and Mary are kissing, but they move apart as a steward with a bottle of wine enters. As the steward slides the door shut, the lights go out, and he draws a knife and lunges at Watson. Watson grapples with the steward, while Mary gets Watson's gun and aims it at the steward's hand. Watson opens the exterior compartment door and grabs the steward by the scruff, throwing him off the train. Mary sits, and Watson takes the gun from her hand, puts his finger to his lips, and then opens the door to the corridor. He sees the woman, who was wanting to use the onboard lavatory while at the station, punch a couple of the soldiers and then shoot two more. The woman is Holmes in a bad disguise. As Watson holds off the soldiers in the corridor, Holmes looks out of the open exterior door and shoves her out of the carriage as they go over a bridge. Watson shuts the door to the corridor and sees Mary has gone. Watson looks out of the window, then at Holmes. As Watson grapples with Holmes, he rips his blouse off as soldiers come in, one aiming a rifle at Watson. Holmes remembers back to earlier, applying lipstick in the corridor as the conductor walks past him while he stands outside the lavatory. Watson watches the exchange. In it, Holmes looks through a grill into the next carriage and sees the soldiers readying their guns. He takes the chain of the cistern, then removes one of the taps from the basin and uses it to open the cover on a gas valve. Holmes decants phosphorous into a container and opens the gas valve, leaving the loo just as the train enters a tunnel. In the darkness, Holmes placed phosphorous dust over the soldier, replaced a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick, and shoved the lipstick case into the muzzle of one of the men's rifles. In the present, the soldier with the rifle pulls the trigger, causing the gun to explode and set fire to the other soldier's phosphorous-dusted clothes. Holmes sets a booby-trap on the door and removes his skirt. Bare-chested, Holmes climbs out of the compartment and shims along the side of the carriage, followed by Watson. They edge their way along the train as a soldier makes his way into Watson's compartment, unwittingly triggering the booby-trapped grenade.",
    "566": "Behind him, six more men in black, all wearing black suits and sunglasses, come over the hill, and Kay barks a few orders to them. He holds up the neuralyzer, and the agents peer closely at it. Kay reaches into his pocket, puts on his own black sunglasses, and pushes a button on the side of the neuralyzer. A blinding flash, a tenth of a second long, sears the agents' eyeballs, and they stare blankly. Kay gestures behind him, where the men in black are now using fire extinguishers to douse the flames they themselves started, and the agents look around, confused. Dee has moved away from them all and is sitting on a rock, staring up at the night sky, his sunglasses dangling idly from one hand. Kay steps away from the group and finds him, sitting down next to him. He looks up at the million stars shining overhead and pulls his neuralyzer from his pocket, looking down at it. These belong to James Edwards, a NYC cop in undercover street clothes. In the background, about ten feet behind, are two other cops trying to keep up, but Edwards is a lot faster. A pair of feet running belongs to a man we will know as the perpetrator. A new set of feet comes into frame as they run down the bridge that traverses Park Avenue in the low forties. The Perp veers to the left and, seemingly oblivious to the fact that it's a thirty-foot drop, he hurdles the guard rail and drops to Forty-first Street below. Edwards is surprised by this maneuver but doesn't waste a second. A double-decker bus, one of those cheesy sightseers that hold up midtown traffic, appears as he too hurdles the guard rail and lands on it. The bus, of course, is completely filled with Japanese tourists, and it seems like every single one of them has a video camera. Edwards pushes through the crowd and pulls out his badge that hangs from a chain under his shirt. Edwards is about to slap the cuffs on the Perp when the Perp blinks. Edwards is thrown for a moment, which is all the time the Perp needs to pull out his weapon, which is the strangest-looking gun you've ever seen. Reacting quickly, Edwards bats it out of the Perp's hand, and the weapon smashes into the stone wall surrounding Central Park and shatters into a million pieces. WHOMP! The Perp kicks him in the nuts, then scrambles to his feet and takes off again. Edwards staggers after him, in pain. The Perp leaps over a moving car towards the Guggenheim Museum; Edwards tries to follow, but a bus pulls in front of him. After it passes, the Perp is gone.",
    "292": "Finally, Stella blurts out as Lisa turns away from the window, and Stella also turns, interrupting her. Jeff, who is still staring out the window, has a look of sudden discovery on his face and calls quickly, turning halfway around and pointing. We see Lisa moving behind him toward the shelf as he adds, then he turns back to the window, holding out his right hand to the side, waiting for the box and viewer. The camera pulls back a little as Lisa comes up and places the box and viewer in his hand. Jeff opens the box, which contains color slides, and holds one or two of the slides up to the light as Lisa looks down at him curiously and Stella comes forward from the background. He squints out through the viewer, then looks away a moment without it before looking back through the viewer. Jeff takes the viewer from his eye, hands it to Lisa, who raises it to her eye. Through the viewer, we see the identical view out of the window, then the viewer moves away, and we are left with the same scene but not quite so still, as a slight breeze stirs the foliage. Jeff looks up to a puzzled Lisa, and all three ease back in awe as Lisa, still looking out, says something. Suddenly Stella begins to chuckle, but her face sobers as she answers their unasked question while Jeff looks at Stella. Halfway through Lisa's speech, Jeff begins speaking, and Lisa suddenly appears at the ground floor door below Thorwald's, hiding and pressing back against the wall tensely. In the corridor above, Thorwald returns frustrated and comes out onto the fire escape directly above Lisa, who is aware of him and immediately retreats into the doorway, disappearing down the lower corridor as Thorwald searches his fire escape. There is a sigh of relief from both of them, and Jeff hands something to her as Stella's brow knits a little, seeing something, and she reaches for the long-focus lens. She lifts it to her eye and opens a small brown bottle, taking out four red capsules which she places on the white tablecloth of her little table in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, where a candle burns in a holder, and other lamps also light the apartment. Miss Lonely Hearts is dressed in sedate street clothes and seems quite at peace as she sits at the table, and by the light of the candle, proceeds to open a black-covered book and read it. The print is fine, and she bends over it a moment, looks up at the capsules, and returns to the book while Stella and Jeff are heard over. She comes down the stairs as Lisa comes up to the two of them.",
    "1043": "Enrique approaches a security checkpoint and a female officer, who calls next. He notices a couple whispering and keeps his eyes on the young couple. As he approaches them, the short cropped-haired man walks away, and the two exchange looks as Enrique strides up to the pretty long-haired woman, Veronica. He grabs her hair and pushes her against a pillar; she holds his head. As she hugs him, he hands her her bag. Enrique reluctantly lets go of her hand and moves away, stopping to glance back. She blows him a kiss. Enrique turns and walks to the security barrier, where he shows his ID and is allowed through. He marches through the podium as the Mayor shakes the President's hand. The Mayor goes to the lectern, and Spanish flags are waved. Enrique rubs his palms together and reflects on Veronica's assignation. The young man leaves her, and Enrique looks up as the Mayor finishes his introduction. President Ashton steps forward and raises his arms wide at his sides, then staggers back and falls. Enrique jumps up onto the podium and runs across it, only to be tackled by Barnes. Matthews and Holden lead Enrique away, as the man in the checked shirt videos it. Enrique spots Veronica striding through the crowd and watches her keenly. She catches sight of him and holds his gaze. His eyes move down from her face to the bag he brought through security for her, which she tosses under the podium. An agent leads Enrique away, but Enrique elbows him in the face and takes the agent's gun. Smoke fills the plaza as Enrique sits up, and Holden, leaning beside the fallen Mathews alongside Barnes, glances across and sees him. Enrique holsters the agent's gun, and Holden gives chase. Enrique rounds a corner with Holden and another agent in pursuit, and Holden shoots in the air. Enrique rushes out into the street, darting into the road as an ambulance approaches, where Veronica sits in the passenger seat. He stands gooping and is hit by a car, but he gets to his feet and runs. Holden and the second agent, Parsons, chase Enrique into an arcade, where he shoves people out of his way. Enrique sprints upstairs and dashes into an apartment building, with residents on the staircase delaying the secret service agents. Enrique runs onto a balcony and leaps from it into a courtyard, and Holden and Parsons reach the balcony railing. They race along the balcony as Enrique dashes away from the apartment building and sprints along the street, looking behind constantly. Dodging traffic, he crosses the road until he is hit by another car, then runs across a road to an underpass carrying highway traffic.",
    "607": "A young blond boy sits cross-legged in front of the large wooden TV set on screen in black and white. Seated guests clap as a movie clip plays at an award ceremony. A man is seated nearby. Sophie is slender and beautiful. A woman on stage reads her name, seated beside a gobsmacked Sophie. Sidney cracks a wide smile and claps. Shapely raven-haired Sophie rises from her seat, Sidney turns to the camera. A smartly dressed man and woman rise from a nearby table. Camera phone pictures of Ricky Gervais. Sidney stands at a red rope barrier. He has a pig on a lead. She looks around nervously. He grins as she lifts the barrier. Alison leads Sidney and the pig away. The Haymarket Hotel. Sidney is dressed as a waiter with a fake mustache. Britney wags her curly tail. Sidney tosses her a canape, and she snaffles it down. Obscuring his face with a tray of canapes, he saunters into the party past the Nazi Clipboard woman. He sits by a pool chatting with Thandie Newton. The brown-haired hotel manager knocks on Sidney's room door. He enters to find that the room has been trashed. Chocolates and booze bottles litter the floor by the open fridge, and upturned furniture is strewn about the room. Unseen, Britney trots out of the hotel room and scurries down a corridor to a lift. The electric doors close. Thandie smiles coyly. She bursts out laughing and pats him at the thigh. Britney wanders out of the lift. Thandie smiles flirtatiously. He sips champagne. She gives him a sultry look, and he grins as he lets out a bashful sigh disturbing the fake mustache. Noticing this, Thandie frowns. Britney urinates on a lady's red high heels. The PR Nazi pushes through the crowd. Sidney spots Britney. Thandie stands. Bouncers approach. Sidney scampers. The PR Nazi watches hawkishly. Thandie shrugs. Two bouncers give chase. A woman is pushed away. He takes a running jump and a photographer snaps him mid-flight. The postmodern review has a photo from the newspaper in which Clint Eastwood has him in a headlock. He hears the phone ringing, and staff arguing in the next room. Holding a lit cigarette, Sydney strides into his busy living room come office. A cover of postmodern review disparages Sharp's editor. The writers have gathered in a frenzy to watch the fight brew. The women flaunt and flip the fax machine over. An airplane soars through the blue sky. At night, the glimmer of a taxi staring out the window as he's swept through. He gazes, wide-eyed, at a sign over the entrance of a theater, cruises through Chinatown. His smile fades as he sees a helicopter.",
    "846": "Looking through the passenger side window, he sees the skiptracer lying groggily against the wheel. The side door bursts open and Diana rolls onto her feet. Blood drips from her nose. She hugs him. He glances back. A tractor-trailer plows through the rental car, tearing it to pieces. Sandy stands motionless with his gaze fixed on the wreckage. Sandy looks at her and softly nods. Later, he drives the beat-up van along a narrow dirt road. In an office, Big Chuck sits across from Marisol and Julian. Big Chuck's smile fades. Chuck eyes the thugs. Julian slams Chuck's head against the desk. Diana searches the van. The temperature gauge rises. Sandy pulls over as steam wafts from the hood. Sandy steps out and approaches the steaming hood as Diana duct tapes the unconscious skiptracer. She takes a sip. She touches his pecs. Her nose grazes his beard. Sandy props the hood open and lets steam vent out. He stares at the sign, then opens the van. The skiptracer breathes deeply in his duct tape restraint. Now, a state trooper waves on traffic past Sandy's wrecked sedan. As Julian and Marisol cruise by, they overhear a witness. Now, Sandy talks on his cell as he and Diana walk along a deserted road. He shoots Diana a look. She looks away. At night, a pickup truck approaches. Her thumbs. He shows her his phone. Later, they start a fire. He looks up and she shuts her eyes. Sandy shrugs. Sandy lies on his side next to the fire, and Diana snuggles up behind him. She pulls her arm away. A snake slithers toward them. The snake moves closer. He glances back at Diana as the snake slithers into his pants. He springs up and fumbles with his jeans. He pushes his pants off. Sandy tosses his jeans into the woods. A snake lowers from a tree. It drops onto his shoulders. She dips the stick into the fire. She swings the stick. The snake tightens around his neck. The snake watches the flame, then bites into Sandy's neck. Diana whacks it with a stick, and Sandy drops to the ground. She hits it a few more times, then tosses away the stick. Diana grabs the snake and tugs at it, as Sandy pries the reptile's teeth from his neck. Diana tosses the snake away and shakes her hands. In the morning, a cargo train passes by a rusty disheveled station. Diana applies makeup while Sandy lies on a bench in a pair of dirt-covered khakis. Sandy wakes up and reaches for his neck. Diana watches him with a smile. He walks away. He moves to the ticket booth. He looks back at Diana and paces.",
    "1346": "The boys look at each other, afraid, and in quick close-ups, they rewind the film and rip it. In a wide shot of the neighborhood, in the distance, military trucks, jeeps, and buses drive, while neighbors come from their homes in the mid-ground, filled with confusion and talk, with more vehicles arriving. As we boom down, we see Joe and Charles trying to make sense of this as Joe calls to a passing adult, Mr. Harkin, who points out something to Joe. Joe turns to look, and we pan across the scene with various shots of military buses stopping, soldiers ordering and assisting people onto vehicles, all carrying as many belongings as they can. Others load up cars quickly, strapping belongings to the roof, and more people in a panic run to find others who are lost. Orders are being barked, residents can be heard complaining and arguing, walkies squawk, and PA announcements blare as soldiers check their wrist bands. Joe passes an arguing man and soldier. A thousand people have been accounted for so far. Louis lies in a cot in the triage unit, which had fifty beds transferred from the hospital, staring off, head bandaged, eyes open, muttering to himself, as tired, hung over, injured, and in shock as he is. Joe is looking everywhere for his dad and finally sees Louis, hurrying to him. Louis grabs Joe's shirt and pulls him close, speaking in a voice desperate and heartsick. Joe's mind is on fire as he absorbs this, whispering back to Louis, who looks at him with hope. They look at him like he's from Uranus. Jen, Charles’ sister, lies on her cot making her Columbia House Records choices, while Charles is in her face. Jen suddenly closes her magazine, staring suspiciously at him and looking right at us, vulnerable yet seductive. Donny, utterly stunned, is now seen as we move past Donny moving through parked cars, with Joe, Charles, Cary, and Martin keeping up, and the boys ducking as soldiers pass by. In a small, tiled room with no windows, Jack, up all night, pissed off but bored being pissed off, pounds on the door, doing so again until it finally unlocks and opens. A 32-year-old humorless, armed soldier stands there, and Jack is led down a dilapidated, narrow hall with a soldier holding a semi-auto behind him, aimed at Jack's back. As Jack passes an open door, he spies an empty office, through the window of which are a few military vehicles and a handful of airmen on the tarmac. Jack's mind races as he approaches the bathroom at the end of the hall and turns, only to be slam-flattened by Jack, who kneels to him, pushing in close, eyes wide, mind racing with the question of what the hell happens next.",

Now, on a backyard trampoline, Debbie's youngest does a flip while Debbie and Sadie look on. Sitting on a toilet, Pete plays online Scrabble until Debbie opens the door. She lifts her brow with a skeptical nod before snatching his computer tablet and leaving. Later, Pete stands onstage, and in the audience, Pete's goateed friend and Barb share a table with Debbie. The silver-haired man in the amber-tinted glasses takes the stage with a backup musician while at the table, Pete sits by his wife, his boyishly ardent gaze fixed on the stage. Debbie sighs as the music producer bobs his head, mouthing along with the lyrics. Debbie turns away discreetly to yawn as Pete briefly lip syncs at her, and Debbie's eyes close. Later, Pete drives his wife home and pulls over as the fire truck passes in the opposite direction. Debbie watches with a smirk as two other emergency vehicles drive by. Back at home, they enter Sadie's room where Debbie takes Sadie's MP3 player, sets it in a dock, and Sadie smiles as her mother dances. Charlotte bounces up and down, and Sadie grins, then bops her head as she gets up and joins them. Looking on, Pete takes a seat as his wife and daughters dance, and standing, Pete replaces Sadie's music player with his own. Debbie and the girls halt, and as his wife and daughters look on, Pete sways awkwardly, letting his head rock side to side. Debbie gestures toward their glum-faced daughters, and eyeing them, Pete takes his music player from the speaker dock. In the morning, Debbie rushes to the kitchen island, where Pete eats breakfast with the girls, and preparing their lunches, she glares at her husband. Later, Charlotte runs upstairs at a school as Debbie and Charlotte pass a pregnant woman with long, gray hair. They reach a classroom where Debbie hugs an old woman. Later, Debbie ducks down in her car as she smokes a cigarette, blowing smoke out the window and pulling away. Now, a laptop shows a young Graham Parker performing in his heyday, and Pete watches with a mustached 30-something and a hip, young woman. He glances toward his office where Graham heads out. Now, at a home office, Pete plucks a sitar. At night, Debbie faces a laptop as she and Pete lounge in bed, viewing video from the store where Desi's hook-up takes her from behind. Debbie averts her face and hits Pete with a pillow. Now, Charlotte bounces in the doorway across the bathroom between the girls' rooms, and her own hand snatches her out of view as she collapses with her feet sticking out.",

Jack and Fabrizio run up a gangplank. Carrying sacks over their shoulders, Jack and Fabrizio dash into the ship. They run onto one of the upper decks and wave to arm lockers from a railing. Black smoke belches from one of the Titanic's four stacks. Hundreds of passengers wave to the people on the dock below as tugboats pull the Titanic away from the shore. Turning up clouds of silt on the dock, a bearded man turns a crank on a movie camera as the ship glides forward. White seagulls appear no larger than insects as they flutter past the Titanic's massive crowd. Four rows of portholes line the sides of the ocean liner, which glides past a small two-manned sailboat. Inside the Titanic, a brown-haired woman herds a young boy and girl up a corridor. Jack and Fabrizio pass in the opposite direction. Jack enters a berth, and Jack's roommates exchange puzzled looks. In her cabin, Rose unpacks a painting. A porter carries in a pair of suitcases as Cal enters from the adjoining promenade deck. As a porter wheels in a safe on a dolly, Cal jams a bottle of champagne into an ice bucket. As the Titanic cruises in open water, the white-bearded captain steps up beside the first officer. Murdoch strides into the wheelhouse. Moody pulls a telegraph lever to a head full in the engine room, and the needle on an identical machine moves to the same position. Men dash along catwalks as turning gears pump huge pistons up and down. The mustached foreman turns the wheel connected to several steam pipes in the smokey boiler room, which is covered in coal from large furnaces. A needle rises on a steam pressure gauge. Pumping pistons move faster and faster, slicing through the ocean. On deck, Jack and Fabrizio growl against the railing. Behind them, Captain Smith stands on the uppermost deck outside the pilot hub. First Officer Murdoch steps up beside him, and the captain glances at him and grins. Jack points towards something below, where a dolphin swims ahead of the ship. Other dolphins join the first one, zooming through the clear water like zig-zagging torpedoes. One dolphin leaps out of the water. Jack smiles as he gazes down at the dolphins, and behind them, a crew member hands a teacup to Captain Smith. He sips his drink while gazing out to sea. From the boiler room, men dump wheelbarrows of coal beside stokers who shovel the fuel. An engineer leans over a railing as massive pistons pump on either side of it.",
    "11": "She stares at her reflection critically and says this as if it were a threat, then notices a smudge on the mirror and wipes it off. The front door opens to reveal Carolyn, greeting us with the smile she thinks could sell ice to an Eskimo. Smiling, Carolyn leads a man and woman into the living room. They're thirtyish, and they've seen a lot of houses today. The man and woman glance around the dark room, unimpressed, and the woman wrinkles her face, skeptical. Carolyn enters, followed by a different couple in their fifties, and stands with another couple: African American, late twenties. The woman is pregnant. Carolyn stands by the pool next to two fortyish women. She locks the sliding glass door and starts to pull the vertical blinds shut, then stops. Standing very still, with the blinds casting shadows across her face, she starts to cry: brief, staccato sobs that seemingly escape against her will. Suddenly she slaps herself, hard, but the tears continue. She slaps herself again and repeatedly until she stops crying. She stands there, taking deep breaths until she has everything under control, then pulls the blinds shut, once again all business. She walks out calmly, leaving us alone in the dark, empty room. We're at a high-school basketball game where teenage boys play a fast and furious game. One team wearing pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket. Perky cheerleaders jump up and down as the crowd goes wild. Seated in the bleachers, next to the high school band, is a group of about twenty teenage girls, dressed in pale blue and white uniforms. Among them, Jane sits next to Angela Hayes. At sixteen, Angela is strikingly beautiful, with perfect even features, blonde hair, and a nubile young body; she's the archetypal American dream girl. Carolyn drives with Lester slumped in the passenger seat, and Carolyn stares at him, unsure of how to respond. The uniformed girls now stand in formation on the gym floor, and in the crowded stands, Lester and Carolyn find seats. They're well-rehearsed, but too young to carry off the ambitious Vegas routine they're attempting. Lester, watching from the stands, picks out his daughter. Jane performs well, concentrating, while dancing awkwardly next to her is Angela. Suddenly Angela looks right at us and smiles, a lazy, insolent smile. We're focused on Angela now, and everything starts to shift as the music acquires an eerie echo. We zoom slowly toward Lester as he watches, transfixed. The light on Angela grows stronger, and the other girls disappear entirely. Lester is suddenly alone in the stands, spellbound, as Angela looks directly at us now, dancing only for Lester. Her movements take on a blatantly erotic edge as she starts to unzip her uniform, teasing us with an expression that's both innocent and knowing, then.",
    "822": "Hannah beams at him as she is already halfway towards the door and putting her coat on, while the handsome guy, Jacob, stares after her with a smile. Cal drives along a dark street with Jessica in the passenger seat, who gazes down uncomfortably before she glances up at Cal, who’s focused on the road. She hangs her head and gazes down again, and with trepidation, she glances at him again but looks away again. He shakes his head, she nods, and he smiles. Cal claps a hand over his mouth, puts a hand to his head, and then pulls up outside a house. Jessica frowns and nods, as she, tall and slightly gangly, stands outside a house and watches as Cal drives off, her brow pinched forlornly. People are leaving the upmarket bar where Hannah and Liz were, while Cal sits at the bar, resting his head on his hand, and stares down glumly, drumming his fingers on the countertop. Cal smiles gently and turns to look at a woman on his left, leaning towards her as she turns to him, but he shakes his head. She’s talking to her friend as Cal taps his glass on the bar and laughs at his own joke, looking over at Jacob, who’s making a bunch of women laugh. Cal sucks his drink through a straw as a balding man makes his way through an open-plan office and knocks on a glass door where his colleague fakes surprise. Cal heads out as his colleague pats him, and he closes his eyes as everyone in the office gives him a round of applause. It’s raining outside, with two chairs and a table in a pretty garden with white and red rose bushes, along with a wooden bench and a climbing frame. Cal stands by a rental truck and stares ahead, solemn-faced, as Emily pinches the bridge of her nose with tears welling in her eyes, and she nods. He looks her in the eye, she reels slightly, their gaze lingers, then Cal gets in the driver’s seat of a rental truck, closes the door, and Emily watches as Cal reverses. She walks along by the truck, her arms folded, then looks down. Cal’s back at the same bar, which is busy with people chatting, and he sits alone at the counter, drinking a vodka cranberry through a straw. He spots Jacob opposite him, eating a burger and chips alone at the bar, and Jacob wipes his mouth with a napkin and then gets up. Jacob puts on his suit jacket and glances over at Cal, who quickly lowers his gaze and sips his drink as Jacob makes his way over to a table of young women and starts chatting to them. Cal shakes his head disapprovingly and lets out a sigh as a middle-aged man in a shirt and tank top comes in.",
    "498": "Cole's attention is drawn back to the bed by his mother's voice, where he finds her laying, her face showing deep sadness as she speaks in her sleep. He touches her face with his tiny fingers while holding her stare with trembling eyes. After some time, he opens his mouth to speak, taking a while before the words come out. On a downtown Septa public bus, Malcolm and Cole are among the passengers, wearing suits. Cole leans his head against the glass of the scratched window, taking in the passing scenery, as Malcolm slips back into silence. The city bus maneuvers through the old Philadelphia streets, heading downtown, past rows of parked cars extending onto the streets. A somber crowd, including people in suits and dark dresses, moves in and out of a home's front door. Cole and Malcolm join the visitors, slowly walking towards the doors. A frail, little four-year-old girl in a dark dress sits on swings outside the house. Inside, the packed home is standing room only with mourners. The air is filled with dozens of hushed voices. Cole quietly stares at the door, waits for a long time before reaching for the doorknob, then gazes into the girl's bedroom. He sees a hospital bed near the window, walls covered with get-well cards and drawings, and shelves filled with puppets. Next to the shelf is a puppet stage and a camcorder on a mini tripod. Cole approaches the shelf, picks up a finger puppet dancer, and places it in his pocket. On the girl's desk, he notices a large collection of video cassettes. Carefully reading the labels, he moves towards the closets, watches as the girl's hand retracts under the bed, and stays very still. Waiting, he slowly bends down, his hands touching the floor, then tilts his head to look under the bed, seeing the emaciated little girl who had come to his tent, curled on the floor glaring at him with bulging eyes. She suddenly moves, thrusting a jewelry box forward, which slides across the floor and stops at Cole's feet. They stare at each other in the room, thick with mourners, most gathered around the girl's mother, a young woman in her late twenties. Malcolm observes breathlessly from the doorway as Cole navigates through the adults across the room. The girl's father, Mr. Collins, a thin man in his late twenties, is seated on a reading chair next to a TV.",
    "119": "The cylinder goes on revolving, but no more voice comes—only the whir of the needle on the empty record. At last, he remembers to replace the horn. Neff has just come out of Keyes' office. He walks slowly back towards the reception room entrance, then stands there looking out through the glass doors. All the employees have now left. Neff is entirely alone. He moves as if to go out, then stops rigidly as his face lights up with the excitement of a sudden idea. He turns quickly and walks on to his own office and enters. Neff walks across to his desk, lifts the telephone, and dials a number. Neff hangs up and stands beside the desk with a grim expression on his face, takes a handkerchief out, and wipes perspiration from his forehead and the palms of his hands. The gesture has a symbolic quality, as if he were trying to wipe away the murder. Over his face comes the commentary. The lights are turned on. Phyllis is coming down the stairs. She wears white lounging pajamas, and she is carrying something small and heavy concealed in a scarf in her right hand. She reaches the front door, opens it slightly, fixes the catch so that the door can be opened from outside. She switches off the porch light and the hall light. She moves towards the living room, where there is still light on. Neff comes through the arch and walks slowly towards her. Neff sits down on the arm of the davenport, close to her. Neff gets up from the davenport. He listens to the music for a moment. Phyllis just stares at him. He goes quietly over to the window, shuts it, and draws the curtain. Neff takes a few more steps towards her and stops again. Phyllis is silent. Her expression is tortured. Neff goes on until he is close to her. Quietly, he takes the gun out of her unresisting hand. Phyllis puts her arms around him in complete surrender. Neff draws her close to him. As she comes out of the kiss, there is realization in her eyes that this is the final moment. Out of the shot, the gun explodes once, twice. Phyllis quivers in his arms. Her eyes fill with tears. Her head falls limp against his shoulder. Slowly, he lifts her and carries her to the davenport. He lays her down on it carefully, almost tenderly. The moonlight coming in at the French doors shines on the anklet. He looks at it for the last time and slowly turns away. As he does so, he puts his hand inside his coat, and it comes out with blood on it.",
    "699": "A short time later, he takes a suitcase from under his bed and opens it to reveal his red and blue Spider-Man suit. He holds it up and gazes calmly at the spider emblazoned across the chest on its ribbed web, and his anxious eyes quieten. Up in his mansion, Harry turns off the TV and paces past a roaring fire with a hand clasped to his forehead. He stops in front of the portrait of his father and half turns his head to look at Peter, who is in his Spider-Man suit but without the mask. Lit by the glow from the fire, Harry turns around fully to face Peter, revealing ugly burns on his right cheek and a scar across his eye and throat. Harry looks impassively at Peter, then shakes his head. Peter turns away, rebuffed, and leaves by the balcony. In the goblin layer, Harry picks up the green goblin sword from among the debris on the floor. With the disfigured side of his face in shadow, a tear glistens in Harry's good eye, and he nods. Bernard softly withdraws. A huge searchlight picks up the yellow cab ensnared in a web high above the New York streets. Encaged in the cab, Mary Jane looks around nervously. The cab rocks and plummets down the web like a fish being tipped out of a net, then comes to rest on a lower web. A little girl in the vast crowd points up, and a wave of heads turn to face Spider-Man swinging down on a thread. Spider-Man leaps onto a building with the Stars and Stripes fluttering behind him, then launches himself towards the action. He swings up a lamppost, past the reporter, Jennifer Dugan. Spider-Man launches himself through the air, the night lights twinkling all around, and lands on the bonnet of the yellow cab. Venom swings into Spider-Man and knocks him through the windscreen, tearing off the roof. Spider-Man clambers onto the boot as Venom's mask slithers off his face like a tangle of snakes to reveal Brock, who grabs Mary Jane. Brock sends Spider-Man plummeting to a lower web. Spider-Man's wrists are lashed to the web with webbing fired by Brock, who lands on top of him and tears off the Spider-Man mask. Peter's eyes widen as a truck suspended above the yellow cab starts shedding its load of breeze blocks, which rain down like giant hailstones, ripping a door off the cab. Mary Jane tries to maneuver a breeze block lodged in the cab while Peter struggles to free himself. Mary Jane raises the breeze block above her head as the symbiote mask wraps itself around Brock's face. She drops the breeze block, hitting the snarling Venom on the head.",
    "181": "She can only stare in horror at the sight of her dead friend. It is almost as if our eyes have suddenly begun to adjust to the darkness and we see the outline of a man standing right behind her. The outline becomes more and more clear. Laurie suddenly moves away from the corner. The shape lunges out at her. He lunges again with the knife. He lunges at her suddenly with the knife. He stands there holding up the piece of material, then raises the butcher knife and moves for her. The hand grasps a piece of Laurie's blouse and rips it. The knife slices across her arm, ripping her flesh. She screams and spins around. Laurie bumps back into the railing. She leaps backward to avoid the blade and slips over the edge of the railing. The camera pounces down from the second floor and slams into the floor. The camera moves with her as she backs away, screaming at the top of her lungs. She hits the floor and rolls over, holding her leg painfully. It is the shape, wearing the mask, the butcher knife in his hand, gleaming. The shape moves to the top of the staircase and starts down toward her. Then she looks up at the staircase. She pulls herself up off the floor and hobbles into the living room. The shape races down the stairs. She moves for the kitchen. She crawls to the kitchen, rolls inside and slams the kitchen door behind her. In a flash, she leaps up and clicks the lock. She sees the kitchen window over the sink. Laurie slowly climbs to her feet and limps toward the back door. Her hand tries the door. Desperately she tries the door, glancing behind her. There is a pounding on the door from the other side. Suddenly, the kitchen door explodes, the middle of it breaking. The shape reaches through, groping for the lock. The shape's hand reaches for the lock. The shape's hand grabs the lock and clicks it open. The shape pushes the door open and leaps into the kitchen. With a heave, she opens it half-way. She can only get it three-fourths open. She drags herself roughly out the window. Laurie picks herself up from the ground and runs as fast as she can, limping across the backyard, camera moving with her. She looks behind her. She trips on the fallen lamp and falls to the floor. She passes the driveway and scurries into the neighbor's backyard, up to the back door of the house. She pounds furiously on the door. Laurie continues to pound on the door. The back porch light comes on. Through the glass in the back door we see an old woman dressed in a nightgown approach.",
    "762": "Elijah anxiously stares around and spots a man on the other side of the road from the dark brick stadium, then sees the man stride down into the subway. Elijah waits for a car to pass, crosses the road against the traffic lights, and the skirt of his coat flaps open to reveal a purple lining. He almost skips across the street in his anxiety, grabs the handrail to steady himself, and silhouetted against the daylight, he stares down the long steep staircase at the man striding into the tiled station. Elijah watches the man disappear into the station, looks down, and launches himself down the stairs. Using his stick and hanging onto the rail, Elijah tries to stay balanced, but his feet don't land accurately, and he slips. His glass stick flies downwards, and he is sprawled on the stairs on his back with his head downwards. Looking upside down into the station, he sees the man glance back before vaulting the ticket barrier. As the man's jacket flips up, Elijah sees a silver gun with a black grip under it, and his eyes flicker and close. On a sunny afternoon, a white bus stops on a hill at a suburban street, and David gets out still in his security uniform of a green jacket and maroon cap, carrying a holdall. He turns and walks slowly and smiling towards a small green park where a group of boys are playing American football on the grass. Joseph runs up some steps to join David, while the other children mill around a young man with a crew cut, admiring his muscles. They turn and walk away together, Joseph with his hand on his father's back. In the dim light of a basement, David, wearing a light grey sweatshirt, is laying flat on a narrow bench, pushing up a weight's bar. He straightens his arms, lets the bar down onto a pair of supports on either side of the bench, and sits up. Joseph, his fringe hanging to his eyebrows, gazes down at David, who looks around at the weights on the ends of the bar. David looks away, walks behind to the weights, and then sits on a bench, looking down while Joseph moves from one end of the bar to the other. David lies back on the bench, grips the bar, lifts it off the supports, frowning, and lowers it to his chest. As he starts to push it up, his mouth contorts with effort, and a large vein stands out on his forehead from between his eyes up into his scalp. His arms quiver, and his head trembles as he lowers the bar to his chest and pushes it up again. He reaches full arm extension and drops the bar back onto the supports.",
    "1036": "Ryan is distracted, sitting in front of a computer screen, and he puts on a headset. In a meeting with Craig and other employees, Ryan looks at the schedule for the Gold Quest Conference on his laptop. At home, he takes a couple of whiskey miniatures from his fridge and stands looking out of a window with a drink in his hand. A large video screen outside a Las Vegas hotel displays a caption. Ryan waits in the wings of a packed conference hall, and smartly suited, he puts his backpack on a table and steps up to a lectern. Computer-generated backpacks revolve on the screens behind him, and Ryan looks out across the room full of seated delegates. Lost in his thoughts, he hangs his head, then shakes it slightly before looking up and smiling to himself. He taps his thumb on the lectern, walks off past a backstage guy, and leaves the building. Ryan runs through the airport, dragging his case with one hand, while a boarding pass flaps in the other. He reaches a Departure gate, gets the pass checked, and goes through. On a jet, Ryan gazes out of the window at the nighttime lights of Chicago. In a flurry of snow, Ryan picks up a Hertz rental car, signs, gets in, and drives away. Ryan drives along slush-covered roads, glancing at a piece of paper in his hand and scanning the streets. He pulls up, leaves the lights on, and gets out of the car. Jogging along a pavement, he walks up to a large suburban townhouse and rings the doorbell. Ryan steps back, puts his hands in the pockets of his long black coat, and tries to act casual as Alex opens the door. His cheeky smile quickly fades when he sees two young boys run up the stairs behind Alex. Mortified, Alex stares at Ryan, who slowly backs away as she shuts the door. Ryan turns and goes. In a hotel room, he sits staring out of the window into the night and sips a large whiskey. Ryan's solitary figure is framed by one of the row of tall windows in a nondescript hotel block. Ryan arrives at the airport, drags his case through the busy terminal building, swipes his card at the self-service check-in, and takes the shuttle train to his gate. He perches on the edge of a seat, looking morose, when Alex calls him from her car. Ryan looks tearful, and tears well up in his eyes. Ryan opens his mouth as if he's about to speak, but instead shuts his eyes and hangs up, looking deeply hurt. On his flight, Ryan sits staring into space, and a stewardess hands him a glass of champagne.",
    "1359": "Overmyer enters and crosses to Nelec, who reviews a folder, but then Nelec sees something outside: the kids. Jack's cruiser pulls up, and Joe spins around as Jack arrives, grabbing his camera from Charles and saying firmly to Joe. Joe is stunned and instantly humiliated in front of Alice, and he's taken back to the squad car. Jack opens the car's back door, Joe gets in, and Jack slams it shut, then throws the camera and tripod into the passenger seat and slams that door before heading to the house and leaving Joe in the back. Nelec heads outside, and Jack moves to him; this lands on Nelec, and Jack heads off. Jack stops and turns to uncomfortable Nelec. Joe, his breathing heavy, sits in the car with his heart pounding, watching his father move over to talk to Nelec, close again, while Alice watches him sympathetically. The door opens, and Jack enters, letting Joe pass him. Joe closes the door hard and says angrily but restrained. Jack turns to leave, but Joe, enraged, says something that makes Jack stop, stunned, as Joe's heart pounds. Jack moves close to Joe, intimidating, and Joe steps back, feeling Jack is intense. Jack suddenly stops himself, realizing what he's saying and to whom he's saying it, but somehow, in this moment, he can't be a better father than law officer. More upset at himself than Joe, he heads out. Joe rides up a hill, revealing the town cemetery, and sits with his back against his mother's grave, holding her open locket and staring at it. But then he hears a sound and turns, hearing a deep and low sound in the distance. Joe is motionless. He stands, pulls out his flashlight, and aims the beam down the rows of graves toward the big caretaker's shed in the distance. He hears another intense, low sound, then a high pitch hit like metal on wood, and Joe backs up, nervous. Another odd sound occurs, which transitions us to Jack's squad car arriving at the abandoned airfield. Jack's car pulls up, and he gets out. Suddenly, the three large military trucks' headlights come on, all aimed at Jack; he is blinded and tries to see past an IV and medical machinery. He's looking at someone we don't yet see; in the background, Overmyer stands, watching. Nelec is quiet and simple. Now we see who he's talking to: battered and scraped, he lies in a medical bed, afraid but defiant. Dr. Woodward swallows and feels that his time on Earth is coming to an end no matter what he does here. By the door, Overmyer is quietly putting on his black gloves, while Nelec offers a vague, searching smile.",
    "1302": "Graham puts Bo down in the hallway and she stands close to him as the four of them stand quietly in a tight group. Morgan looks at his father, unable to speak, and all four look up. Merrill looks up the stairs at the boarded bedroom doors as Graham takes Morgan's hand and smiles down at his son, who smiles gently back. The group of four turns and watches the top of the stairs, and Merrill's eyes move quietly above the bedroom doors to the ceiling of the upstairs hallway, where he stares at a rectangle with a tiny rope hanging from it. Morgan and Bo are frozen watching a set of long fingers reach under the front door, which change to the exact color and texture of the yellow cracked paint on the door. Graham and Merrill arrive in the front hall, and Graham takes Morgan and Bo by the hand, leading them quickly down the hall as Merrill backs away while watching the top of the stairs. Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement, closing the door behind him, which has no lock. The basement is lined with metal shelves cluttered with canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, and outdoor tools. Merrill rummages through the shelves frantically as Graham puts his ear to the door and listens. Merrill moves to another set of shelves, knocking things to the ground, and there is scratching against the door. The doorknob turns, and Graham grabs it with both hands as the door begins to push open. A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling, the only light in the room. Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground with a three-foot wooden handle, holding it up in the air. He turns and rushes in Graham's direction, clipping the light bulb with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room. Merrill turns the channel knob and checks all the stations, listening to the light hum from the speakers. Graham steps into the beam of lights, looks at the door, and then turns to face the lights. Graham looks at Merrill's corner of the darkness as Morgan moves his beam onto Merrill, putting the flashlight on the ground and rolling it across. The flashlight comes to a stop in Graham's palm, and he picks it up. Merrill slowly catches his breath and reaches over to his side to grab the remaining flashlight, training the beam. Merrill looks at his nephew turning gray as Graham pulls Morgan closer to his body and talks into the child's ear.",
    "507": "They are both quiet for a second. Louise goes a little faster. Hal smiles. The surveillance man motions to Hal to keep it going. Louise's eyes get wide as she hears this. A FINGER reaches up and presses down the lever and hangs up the phone. She has her finger on the lever. Louise is still standing there holding the phone. Thelma stops and looks at her. Max, still holding the phone, is surprised by this outburst. Louise is surprised to be hearing this from Thelma. They are both quiet for a moment. Louise starts the car. They lurch into reverse then screech forward as they tear off down the road. As they fly down the road, Louise and Thelma both get quiet for a second. They are both laughing. The car is still flying down the road. The sun is coming higher in the sky now. They come to an intersection in the middle of nowhere. They turn off onto a dirt road and pull to a stop. The Trucker reaches over and opens a glove compartment crammed full of condoms. He grabs a few and shoves them in his pocket. He turns off his engine and gets out of the truck. He walks up to the car. Louise and Thelma get out of the car. Louise nods. This is not what is supposed to be happening. He is getting a little panicky. Louise pulls the gun they stole from the State Patrolman. He looks at the gun. Louise looks at his truck off in the distance. She points the gun at it, takes a second to get a bead, then shoots two of the tires flat. The truck slowly sinks as the air escapes from the tires. Louise and Thelma look at each other. They both turn towards the truck and fire rounds into the tankers until they explode in a huge ball of fire. The truck driver screams at the top of his lungs. Louise starts the car and starts driving in circles around the truck driver. Thelma and Louise are both howling at the top of their lungs. A steady stream of state police cars pulls out of the parking lot with lights flashing while other policemen are running to their cars still parked in the lot. It does look like an Army. More police cars have joined, and from every direction, police cars are swarming across the desert, although none are in front of them. Thelma is looking way up ahead in the distance. Behind them is a huge wall of dust created by all the police cars following them. In front of them, looking larger every moment, is the awesome splendor of the Grand Canyon.",
    "979": "A postman arrives and hands Benjamin a telegram on the front porch, which Benjamin opens as the postman leaves. Clouds part to reveal a view of Paris from above, with the Arc de Triomphe in the center of the Place de l'Etoile, around which twelve roads extend. Benjamin leaves a taxi and strides through a grassy courtyard, climbs a flight of stairs, and approaches a nurse at a reception desk. He sits down opposite the desk as the nurse makes a call. Meanwhile, a woman leaves her apartment, and a black cab stops. A man takes the cab as she turns to lock her door. Daisy sits on the stage and kicks her legs while a cab breaks sharply. The man inside sits up, and she combs her hair. The nurse ends her call, and Benjamin rises to his feet and enters a hospital ward where he strolls past bed-bound patients. He plows into a woman's room and approaches her hospital bed where she lies with her face bruised and her right leg elevated in a metal frame. She opens her eyes to see his image blurred. He sits down, smiles warmly, but his face falls while she hides her face. He looks at her as she fights back tears. Benjamin looks at the floor, then stares at Daisy, who has her head turned away and her eyes closed. A moment passes, and she turns her head to find he's gone, as a dangling triangular support sways above her, which she grasps sharply. Caroline reads on and then leaps up and goes, wearing a harrowed expression. Her aged mother meets her eye with her wrist bent unnaturally across her chest. Caroline sits back and picks up the diary. Meanwhile, Benjamin sails on a calm lake and leaves a woman's doorstep, as a dark-haired young woman puts on her shoes and hurries out of Benjamin's bedroom. She stops dead, seeing the elderly resident staring at their rooms and at her. Benjamin, fresh-faced with short cropped hair and wearing a bright white T-shirt, stares wistfully, then goes to his window. He alights his sailboat and strolls casually on the wooden jetty, drives a blue motorbike parked outside, and is watched by Queenie from a high window as he crosses the lawn past a guy raking up dead leaves. He removes his cap and glances up at Queenie as he strides towards the main building and jogs up the steps on which he was left as a baby. He pauses on the porch as Daisy stands behind him, and he turns to see her standing in the doorway opposite, dressed in black with her hands knitted together at her waist.",
    "104": "Lt. Dan lifts his pant leg to display his metal leg as Susan shakes Forrest's hand. Jenny steps forward and kisses Lt. Dan's cheek, and the group is seated as they watch Forrest and Jenny take vows on the front lawn. Forrest Jr. stands next to Jenny as the wind blows fallen leaves across the ground. Jenny, Forrest, and Forrest Jr. walk toward the house, holding hands as they walk. Forrest steps into Jenny's bedroom carrying a tray with breakfast on it, and looks at Jenny as she sleeps. Slowly she wakes up and looks at Forrest. Forrest looks up into the sky as the rain stops, removes his helmet, and the stars emerge from behind the clouds. He stands on his boat, looking at a deep orange and red sunset. Forrest runs along a highway and later along a desert highway as a lake reflects the mountains and the sky, and the morning light casts an orange glow over the desert. Jenny looks out the window, and Forrest looks at Jenny, who then reaches over and takes his hand. Forrest stands under the old oak tree where Jenny has been buried, trying to hold back his tears, and watches as her dad's house is knocked down by a bulldozer. He looks at Jenny's grave marker, which reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March 22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend. Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest as they sit together, and Forrest looks down as he sobs. Forrest tries to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong, but when Forrest Jr. serves the ball, Forrest dives and misses it. They sit on a log by the river and fish, and Forrest looks down at the grave marker, placing the letter next to fresh flowers. As he steps back and looks at the grave, a flock of birds flies overhead and lands in the tree, and Forrest turns to watch. The bus drives toward them and stops; the door opens, and Forrest Jr. walks toward the bus. Forrest stands up as Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver, recognizing her as the same driver, only older now, who drove Forrest to school as a boy. Forrest Jr. waves to his father, and Forrest nods approvingly as Forrest Jr. gets on the bus, which then pulls away. Forrest stands next to the mailbox, sits down, and the camera cranes down to reveal the feather lying at his feet. A gust of wind picks the feather up.",
    "641": "In an interrogation room, a corpulent policeman blows cigarette smoke across the table into the face of a terrified, sweating, young male prisoner. The prisoner, Jamal Malik, blinks rapidly as the smoke stings his eyes. The policeman suddenly lunges across the table. A question appears on the screen. Hands scatter Rupee notes onto the floor. The show's host turns to Jamal, standing in the wings of the studio. Jamal and the host walk to their chairs positioned at the center of the studio stage. Back in the police cell, the policeman forces Jamal's head into a bucket of water. A beautiful young woman stands on a train platform. She looks up and smiles. The inspector enters a room where Jamal is suspended off the floor by his wrists. Srinivas reluctantly sets up a car battery with jump leads beneath Jamal's dangling feet. Srinivas attaches the jump leads to each of Jamal's big toes. Jamal glares directly into the eyes of the inspector. The inspector moves to the other side of the room, as Srinivas switches on the battery. The inspector approaches the now limp body of Jamal again and notices that Jamal's eyes are closed and that he's dribbling. The inspector looks closely at his face. Jamal stares. Both the policemen turn slowly toward Jamal. He spits blood. A group of scruffy young boys in filthy t-shirts and shorts play cricket on a runway. Jamal, seen as a young boy here, trips and fails to catch the ball. The other boys slap their heads. They brandish long truncheons. The gang of boys suddenly disperses in all directions. Another boy turns to make a rude gesture at the security men. They clap a high-five. The boys clamber across a rubbish tip, up over corrugated rooftops and down into the narrow alleyways of their slum. The security men dismount and give chase on foot. The security guards struggle to follow the tiny boys as they wind and weave through the filthy, narrow streets between shanty buildings. Some boys throw rubbish from the roofs onto the heads of the guards. A determined guard perseveres in chasing Salim and Jamal down a walkway and past a river swollen with rubbish, plastic bags, and green slime. The boys run along a sewage pipe, followed by the guard hot on their heels. The boys run headlong into a Mercedes. Javed, the local gangster, sits in the back, shouting and angry at the boys. The boys run off as the guard then collides with the car. He backs away apologetically, holding his cap in hand. The boys taunt the guard, turn a corner, and suddenly run into their mother. She drags the boys to school.",
    "1206": "A montage of news images shows a pair of large military-style trucks driven in tandem along a dirt road, the first with a single soldier standing in the back and the second with a whole troop. The trucks pull up, and the troops, dressed in khaki fatigues and wearing wide-brimmed hats with a gold-colored Burmese military emblem, order a group of terrified and cowering peasants off the truck and onto the road while brandishing rifles. The troops pass cash among themselves, as an officer in dark glasses sits coolly smoking a cigarette in one of the trucks. A soldier walks in a nearby paddy field and tosses a primed grenade, causing the villagers to cower. The soldier then primes and tosses two more grenades, which splash harmlessly on sodden ground, before stopping about 100 yards from the truck. The peasants are pushed at gunpoint to the edge of the field and begin to half-run, half-stumble across the paddy field towards the solitary soldier as the troops watch impassively, and the commander pulls on his cigarette. One of the peasants is blown to pieces, leaving the rest to stand still. The commander nods to a soldier, and at the command, the troops open fire, shooting down the peasants. Low clouds hover above mountains, with a verdant valley edged with ferns and a small stream running through it. Captions in military white type appear as a mustachioed local man in a baseball cap and striped T-shirt pokes undergrowth with a stick, joined by a second man wearing a bandana and a red shirt, and a third man, John Rambo. Rambo, dark-haired, heavy-set, muscular, and sullen-faced, wears a khaki smock and a red paisley bandanna. Rambo pushes his stick, which has a hook on the end, into the greenery, where a cobra rears in the grass. The men, identified as snake-wranglers, surround the cobra as it lunges at them in turn, with Rambo ultimately scooping up the snake by its neck and securing it in a sack. The trio return to a small boat moored on a sandbank where the stream widens into a river, sloshing through shallow water as Rambo leads the men up the boat's gangplank. The boat is on a lake, silhouetted against the sun, where Rambo stands on the prow with a bow and arrow. His arrow has a line attached, and he draws the bow-string, fires into the water, and pulls out a large fish, which has been skewered by his arrow. On a river, the boat passes a small canoe with two men and a small boy, and one of Rambo's friends hands a fish to the small boy.",
    "1319": "Gin attaches the cables, then leans down to Gin. Behind Jesse, in Men's Wear, is Lois, wearing a frown of pruney disapproval, and, seeing that he's not looking, she inexplicably nudges a table of sweaters a few feet over, which makes a loud SQUEEEEEEEAK, but it's too chaotic on the floor for anyone to notice. Satisfied with her placement of the table, Lois heads out the door. Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales deeply, and Marcus grimaces. Jesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled ARM, triggering an LED readout labeled ARMING to count down from 30 seconds. Marcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room, reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Lois bought, and aims it down into the room, causing the huge bank of VCRs to power down. Marcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct as Willie stares at the safe and continues to stare, licking his lips. Meanwhile, Marcus emerges from a stockroom with a cart to begin his shopping spree, starting in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere scarf, while Willie applies a stethoscope to the safe, tapping with one hand and listening intently. Marcus moves to Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin. Willie applies and then pulls back a drill from the safe, batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door, and is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock. Marcus keeps leaping at the mannequin, swings at its knees with a golf club, and, having chopped it down, drags off its stole. Willie uses a plasma welder on the safe, returns to batter it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each swing, and then hunches at the back of the safe, stethoscope to its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles. Through the stethoscope, hollow THUNKS are heard followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK, and Willie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment, he rises, and one can see the safe door finishes creaking open as Marcus enters the room. Willie looks at Marcus, who starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the Santa sack. A big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant is seen, and Willie's hand hesitates between this elephant and a purple one behind it, finally taking the pink one after briefly leaving with the purple. Willie turns around holding the stuffed elephant to find Marcus and Lois standing there, with Lois presenting a grotesque picture: she has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, and an abdomen exerciser.",
    "1155": "Krum strides past wearing a singlet, followed by a group of giggling girls, and Hermione looks flustered. In class, Ron whispers to Harry, and Snape clips his ear. Fred passes Ron a note and then throws the crumpled note at Angelina, pointing to her, miming dancing, and then pointing to himself. Angelina gives him a thumbs up, and Fred winks at Ron. Snape swipes Ron and Harry with a book, and she gets up, hands her book to Snape, and returns before stalking off. Snape hits them again. A blanket of snow lies over Hogwarts as Harry, hands pushed deep inside his pockets, runs up the stone steps to the owlery and stamps the snow off his boots. At the door, he almost bumps into Cho coming out, and they sidestep each other in the doorway. Harry swallows hard and later lies moodily in the common room, clutching the golden egg. Ron is led in by Ginny, and Harry runs after Parvati and Padma on the evening of the Yule Ball. Lights shine from the Durmstrang galleon on the frozen lake as excited students gather in the entrance to the great hall. The girls wear long gowns, and the boys dress robes. In his room, Ron adjusts his tatty robe and stares at himself in the mirror. Harry comes in wearing a smart black robe and a white bow tie, sniffs his armpit, and looks in the mirror again. On the stairs, Ron hurries Padma away, and she follows reluctantly. Harry spots Cho with Cedric as Parvati sees Hermione slowly descending the stairs. Harry turns his attention from Cho and sees Hermione looking like a princess in pink, her hair softly curled as she smiles at him shyly. Krum is in dress uniform with a fur-trimmed cloak over his shoulder, clicking his heels and bowing. Hermione takes his arm and gives Harry an excited little wave as the huge doors swing open. The Triwizard competitors and their partners process into the great hall, with Harry looking very apprehensive as he walks stiffly beside Parvati. Padma stares at Hermione as snow falls from the enchanted ceiling. Clutching Harry's arm, Parvati waves to her friends as he clutches her waist and she guides him around the floor. Harry lifts her awkwardly into the air and swings her around while Dumbledore leads Professor McGonagall onto the dance floor. Filch dances with his cat, and Viktor Krum swings Hermione high into the air as Cedric dances past with Cho. Neville confidently takes to the floor with Ginny and spins her around with ease. Exposing his metal leg, Mad-Eye Moody sits in an alcove wearing a kilt and a ferret sporran, swings from his hip flask, and gives a shudder. Hagrid sidles over to the towering Madame Maxime and gives her a wink, gesturing towards the dance floor.",
    "1053": "Darcy is striding towards Pemberley, his wet shirt clinging to his broad chest, as his groom leads the horse behind him. The groom goes off in one direction, and Darcy in the other. He emerges from the trees into a field filled with buttercups and makes his way down the hill towards the large lake fronting Pemberley, its classic lines reflected in the still waters. Lizzie is also making her way down to the lake, lost in thought, and she turns to see Darcy striding out of the woods towards her. Darcy stops dead in his tracks, bows, then continues on his way just as the Gardiners come down the hill towards Lizzie, who's looking a little unsettled. Darcy hurries down some steps into the courtyard, quickly pulling on his coat, pauses for a moment to decide which direction to go, then marches off through an archway, where he catches up with Lizzie. He walks off and Mrs. Gardiner takes Lizzie's arm, and they set off after Darcy and Mr. Gardiner, who are walking a few paces ahead. When they stop to look at the view, Lizzie hangs back, and Darcy comes over to her, leaving the Gardiners to their admiration of the countryside, and he and Lizzie walk on together. Lizzie keeps her gaze averted from him as the party continues their walk through the trees, with Lizzie and Darcy a fair distance ahead of the Gardiners. Later, Darcy is helping Lizzie up into her carriage and as the carriage draws away, Darcy stands watching it. Lizzie turns to see him grow ever smaller in the distance. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery, with smooth rocks sculpted by the wind and the beautiful countryside of the Peak District stretching out to the horizon. Lizzie is walking down a narrow, cobbled street, and a young woman leans out of a top window of a building as Lizzie passes below. Lizzie looks surprised, goes inside, and heads straight into the parlor, where Mr. Darcy is sitting waiting for her. As soon as he sees her enter, he leaps up from his seat, bows in greeting and Lizzie curtsies in return. He indicates a young woman standing on the other side of the room, and Lizzie goes over. The two ladies curtsy, and Mr. Darcy nods and leaves the room. Lizzie looks at Georgiana and smiles. Mr. Bingley enters the room, Georgiana curtsies, and leaves them to it. That evening, Mr. Darcy watches Lizzie with adoring eyes as she plays and sings at the piano, with a number of guests gathered in the drawing room to listen, including Mr. Bingley, the Gardiners, Louisa Hurst, and Miss Bingley, who has a sour look on her face.",
    "915": "Alvin nods and heads off as Pete and Homer swagger off. Dillinger leans toward Red, who eyes the brunette in the red dress as she returns to her table. Anna leads a young woman to Red, then follows Red and Veronica as they stroll away, leaving Dillinger alone. He stares at the brunette in the red dress, who laughs and beams. The gang leader sips his drink and stands, keeping his eyes locked on the exotic woman. He strides resolutely through the crowd, halts just behind her, and leans onto her chair. She looks up at him, and he gives his head a stunned shake. Her bright red lips smile coyly, and she grins at the other women seated at her table before sashaying off with Dillinger. He warily locks eyes with her, then looks away. Billie leads the way to the dance floor, where he takes her hand, and she places her other hand on his shoulder. They sway together as Billie smiles. Dillinger gazes off shyly, then finds her lovely face, and Billie stares back defiantly. Her dark eyes probe his as they sway with the music, and she allows a faint smile. Dillinger summons up a breath and arches his brows, and her smile broadens. On stage, the songstress gazes out over the crowded dance floor. Later, Billie and Dillinger stride through the club's foyer, with Billie wrapping her crimson jacket tight around her body. They step outside, and she winces against a gust of wind as Dillinger turns her to face him and drapes his overcoat over her shoulders. She grins bashfully and continues down the sidewalk with his jacket and arm around her. In an elegant restaurant later, Billie uneasily scans her surroundings, then looks to Dillinger, smiles, and glances at a female diner. The snobbish woman gives her the eye, and Billie's smile briefly falters. Dillinger flashes an amused smile and sits back but then breaks off, eyeing another table. Billie and Dillinger lock gazes, and under Billie's thick, dark eyelashes and graceful nose, a faint smile curls the corners of her lips. Dillinger stands and holds her chair as she gets up, then guides her through the restaurant with a hand at her back until they face a coat check counter. At a bar, a stocky man with slicked-back hair notices them. Dillinger glances at the man over his shoulder, then leans toward Billie and steps away. Billie, irritably shifting her gaze, then glares at him and yanks on her coat before she storms out. The two men shake hands as Nitti, a lean man with dark, slick hair and a handlebar mustache, slouches as he eats. A short, husky man with olive skin and a toothbrush mustache approaches Dillinger, and they shake hands before D'Andrea leaves.",
    "1124": "Two eyes staring are followed by Rufus Scrimgeour, the Minister of Magic, being photographed at a press conference. At home, Hermione reads the headlines in the Daily Prophet while Harry Potter's uncle, Vernon, drags a suitcase to his car as Harry watches from his bedroom window. Outside the rebuilt Weasleys' home, Ron stands staring over the wreath beds toward the horizon as his mother and sister, Ginny, are busy in the kitchen. Ron glances briefly behind him before turning back to the wreath beds. Hermione's parents watch TV as she looks at them sadly and raises her wand, causing the tip to glow. The images of Hermione as a baby and a young child slowly fade from view in the photographs on the mantelpiece. Hermione's eyes fill with tears as she sees herself disappearing from every photograph in the home. Harry's Aunt Petunia sits in a car, staring blankly, while Uncle Vernon looks nervously at the sky and Dudley clambers into the backseat. Harry stands alone on the path watching them go. Standing outside her front door, Hermione looks back for a moment, then with her head lowered, walks down the path and strides along the street, her long wavy hair ruffled by a breeze as she carries a small beaded bag. A Death Eater, a dark shadowy figure, zooms over the countryside towards a large manor house on a country estate, descending to the ground. The Death Eater walks towards the gates, waves his wand to make them evaporate, allowing him to step through, his face somber with dark, lank, shoulder-length hair, and the gates reappear behind him. Snape enters a bare storeroom and climbs a flight of stairs to where people are seated at a long table in front of a blazing fire, and at the end of the table, a woman hangs horizontally in mid-air. Snape sits close to Voldemort as a huge snake glides on the floor beside Pius Thicknesse. Voldemort turns to Snape and she shrinks back. He passes behind the Malfoys as Lucius Malfoy turns his face twitching as he reaches for his wand, his hand shaking as he holds it out to Voldemort, who runs his fingers over it, then snaps off its handle. Snape watches keenly as Voldemort discards the handle, and Lucius trembles while Voldemort points the wand at the floating woman, who pleads with Snape as he stares coldly. Voldemort flicks the wand and she falls dead on the table, causing Draco Malfoy to wince and a single tear to fall from Charity's eye. Voldemort strokes the snake, which glides onto the table and slithers towards the dead woman, its tongue flickering and mouth opening wide. Albus Dumbledore falls from the astronomy tower, floating gently downwards.",
    "356": "The screaming Nazgûl fall from the sky in flames as the ground shakes so violently that Frodo and Sam can barely stand. Frodo stumbles, and Sam helps him up. Frodo smiles, and Sam looks down at Frodo, whose face is at peace with his burden destroyed. Frodo and Sam crawl onto a rock as lava streams towards them, and in seconds, their rock becomes an island in a sea of molten lava. Frodo shuts his eyes and then glances at Sam, who is weeping. Frodo wraps an arm around Sam's shoulder as the two tiny hobbits wait to die amid the cataclysmic landscape, with lava erupting around them and fireballs raining down from the sky. The scene slowly fades to black. Gwaihir, the great eagle, flaps towards the camera, bearing Gandalf on his back and followed by two more eagles. The eagles bravely fly amid the raining ash and molten rocks and snatch Frodo and Sam from the rock. Frodo's face can be seen as the fiery volcano recedes away beneath him, and the wind ruffles his hair before he passes out. Frodo's eyes flutter open, and he looks around slowly; his eyes alight on Gandalf, whose face breaks into a smile. There is laughter as Merry and Pippin run in, jumping on the bed and hugging Frodo. Gimli and Legolas enter the room, their joy plain. Aragorn joins them, and the Fellowship is complete. Finally, Frodo's eyes fall upon a figure standing apart from the others: it is Sam. Frodo's and Sam's eyes meet. The scene sweeps over the Minas Tirith walls, racing towards the top of the city through a blizzard of white flower petals as Minas Tirith is restored and gleams white. Soaring up, the scene reveals the Court of the Kings, crowded with 4000 people cramming the wide path leading to the tower. The Crown of Gondor glints in the brilliant light as Gandalf places it upon Aragorn's head. Aragorn smiles up at Gandalf and slowly rises, turning to face the crowd, who cheer and clap for their king. The cheers of his people are deafening as Aragorn sings for them, then walks in slow procession down the white-paved path while the crowd bows their heads in respect to their new king. Aragorn passes Eowyn and Faramir, who bow before him, and Éomer steps forward to bow in respect. Trumpets sound as a procession of elves, dressed in shimmering silvers and whites, led by Legolas, approach the king. Legolas gestures behind him, and Aragorn’s eyes scan among the elves. A banner is carried aloft bearing the White Tree of Gondor in full flower. The ranks of elves part, revealing Arwen, her eyes shining. Mortal now, but deeply in love, she is carrying the standard of Gondor. Aragorn kisses her as Elrond looks on, his face breaking into a smile. Aragorn and Arwen embrace, then walk through the crowd towards four small figures who stand nervously at the end of the procession.",
    "559": "Donovan strides across the room toward Indy, exuding confidence and power while dressed in a tuxedo, and shakes hands with Indy. Donovan goes to a table where an object is wrapped in cloth, throws back the cloth revealing a flat stone tablet about two feet square, inscribed with letters and symbols, and puts on his glasses to make a closer examination. Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses as Indy reads. Suddenly, Indy stops and looks up at Donovan with a startled expression, then rubs his chin with a dubious expression as he takes the glass of champagne Donovan now offers him. Indy stiffens slightly at the mention of his father and nods. The door opens and Mrs. Donovan, a matronly woman in an expensive evening gown, steps into the room. Donovan leans over and kisses her cheek, and she sighs to herself and returns to the party. Indy, meanwhile, has turned his attention back to the Grail Tablet, obviously hooked by its archaeological promise. He moistens his finger with champagne and rubs it over the Tablet, as Donovan steps up next to him. Indy has to shake his head at Donovan’s apparent lack of judgment. Donovan produces an ancient leather-bound volume with very brittle pages, and Indy views the manuscript with considerable interest. A Ford coupe speeds down the tree-lined street and pulls up in front of the house. Indy climbs from the car and hurries up the walkway, with Brody a step behind. They climb the porch, notice that the front door is ajar, and exchange a quick look of concern as they enter. Indy approaches the half-open front door, pushes open the door, and enters the house, calling out. Indy opens one half of the curtains dividing the hall from the sitting room to reveal the place has been ransacked. Brody sees Indy's face and opens the other half, and they walk into the room. Brody picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk, and Indy turns to see the pile of torn papers and envelopes. He immediately empties his pockets of his own mail taken earlier in the day from his college office and finds the envelope with the Venice postmark. Indy uncovers a small book that looks like a journal or diary and flips through it, finding page after page of handwritten notes and drawings. Brody glances at it with great curiosity. As Indy asks the question, he turns to a painting on the wall depicting Christ on the Cross, his blood being captured in a golden chalice, and a second painting showing Eleventh Century Crusaders plummeting to their deaths over a high cliff, with one Crusader floating safely in midair because he holds the Grail in his hands.",
    "1362": "Mike exits the stage door and walks into the alley, followed by the confused camera crew. As Abby looks horrified, the phones in the control room start ringing off the hook, and realizing her defeat, Abby sighs and grabs the microphone for Mike's earpiece. On the monitor, there is a slightly puzzled look from Mike, but he lifts the girl's finger and licks the Jello off it. As Mike waves to the camera, he's pulled into the Jello pool and the girls rip off his shirt. Mike walks in, covered in Jello, to find Abby standing there, arms crossed, quietly containing her rage, and she walks off. Confused by her reaction, he follows. Close on Stuart, wearing a grave expression, Abby nods, uncomfortable. Strategically placed cardboard suns and clouds cover her bosom. Abby covers the cat's eyes, then looks away, but a moment later, she's looking back in the window, to see Colin step out of the shower. Abby leans closer to see Colin start flossing, wearing only a towel, and she freezes. Mike approaches them, and she turns and walks off. Abby enters her office, and Mike follows her. Colin, in a white doctor's jacket, talks on the phone while going over patient files. Mike picks up the extension and listens in. Abby glares at him, but she can't stop him. A concerned look from Abby as the phone rings, she thinks, looks at the phone again, and she answers the phone. A confused look from Colin as he talks on the phone. Abby hesitates, there is a long pause, and then Mike hangs up the phone and hustles her out of the room. Night has fallen on the condo complex as Abby enters, looking amazing in a little black dress and slingbacks, and she grabs his ass. Switching tactics, Abby slips into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm, leans into him seductively, gives him a look, leans in closer, and then he shoves her away. Mike leaps over the couch and hides as Abby walks over to the door and opens it. Colin stands there, and she hustles him out the door. Abby realizes she's spoken aloud and blanches, waiting for Mike's instructions, she grabs a napkin and starts rubbing his khakis. The Jumbotron camera follows the guy catching the fly, then finds Abby and Colin, pans over to them, and it looks like Abby is giving Colin an enthusiastic hand job. The entire stadium, ballplayers included, stop what they're doing and stare. Colin gives a wave and walks toward his condo. Abby pretends to enter her house until she sees Colin close his front door, then she turns around and rushes over to Mike and throws her arms around him, embracing him, and Mike pulls back, a little uncomfortable.",
    "653": "Under a moody blue sky with tearing white and gold clouds, a woman in Grecian style robes holds aloft a shining torch. Pages of comic magazines flip by, with words like \"bap\" and \"boom,\" and finally the word \"marvel\" appears. A ray of blue light shines, and the scene cuts to starring Tobey Maguire. It feels like someone is punching through a red, smoky tunnel, but the spider's web is always present. A muscular arm and a clenched hand are entwined in the web as the hand stretches up to catch more silk threads. A sharp-featured head, resembling a mask with long pointed ears, a humped nose, barred teeth, and a jutting jaw, appears. The opening titles continue with an animated background of skyscrapers. Two hands touch fingertips to fingertips, the picture spins, and window frames appear, revealing a large guy eating a doughnut. A youth chases a school bus, which stops to let him on; he has dark hair and spectacles. The pasty-faced young man, Timothy, makes his way down the bus while a girl with her hair in bunches and big spectacles puts her books in the empty seat beside her. Flash Thompson, with his arm around Mary Jane, nods to another student as the doughnut eater shakes his head. Young Parker keeps walking, his eyes fixed on Mary Jane, not noticing a leg stuck out in front of him, causing him to tumble to the floor and his specs to fall off. The yellow school bus rolls on, arriving outside Columbia University. As Parker approaches Mary Jane, she smiles and waves, but he realizes she was greeting her girlfriends behind him, leaving him embarrassed. A Rolls Royce pulls out, and a sulky young man clamors out to address Parker. Peter and Harry turn away, with Peter pointing his camera as Flash Thompson bumps into him. Harry goes over to Mary Jane, and Peter overhears their conversation. Harry turns to Peter and grins as the spider hovers above. A teacher leads Harry away, and Peter stares at the curious Mary Jane standing in front of the display of spiders in their transparent plastic cages. Wide-eyed, Peter gazes forlornly at her as she moves to the side of the display, and he stands in front of a TV monitor. Unbeknownst to them, the missing super spider begins to ease its way down a silky thread from its newly spun web while Mary Jane continues to pose with notes in hand. The spider inches its way down towards Peter, and as it settles on his hand, Mary Jane's friend calls to her, and she turns to leave. The spider bites Peter, who shakes it off, sending it landing on the gray carpeted floor where it scuttles away. Peter examines the bite, noticing a circle of red around the already swollen area on the back of his hand.",
    "1320": "A dark shape, growing and coming down fast, appears in the reflection as a dark figure in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. After a moment, he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, a shaved head, and deep-set eyes. He quickly checks his surroundings, seeing nothing but brick walls above him. Then the rain starts to hammer down, and Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body, dashing toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the street just in time to see a fleet of police cars tearing around the corner, sirens wailing, heading his way. He runs his finger along its edge. Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath, which is covered with dark tattoos. As his coat falls to the ground, we drift over to the brick wall behind him where we see Michael's shadow crouch over. The rain pounds harder, seemingly as punishment from the heavens. The glint of a knife comes down fast, and then silence. Michael, his face tight with pain, puts his trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, and stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street. SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass and bursts in. He tosses a first-aid kit into the sink, then his trench coat falls to the floor; under the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two horrifically open wounds running between both shoulder blades. He threads a needle, not with thread but with fishing wire, and begins to stitch the wounds closed as blood pools on the cement floor around his feet. Trench coat and shirt back on, Michael races along endless racks of guns, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise as if he's trained his whole life for this. Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit. The place is locked up tight, with a metal gate over the front doors and bars over the windows. Two cops, world weary, cruise through downtown. Burton stares out at the city's rain-soaked denizens with a deep hatred for the shadows looming in doorways and the streetwalkers. He holds his finger up like a pistol, aiming it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one. In the distance, the pop-pop of gunfire is heard. The police radio crackles with urgent chatter and many voices talking at once as Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground. Slowly, Michael places his palms on his skull.",

In an office, Debbie faces her gynecologist. Debbie cocks her head, her mouth twitching. She stares, her head tilted to the side. Averting her woeful gaze, she rubs her fingers across her throat. The doctor's smile fades. Fighting tears, she nods then shakes her head. Gazing upward, Debbie rubs her brow and throat. She strokes her forehead. Now, the sunlight casts a bright glow off of Debbie's long, golden blonde hair as she drives. Pouting, she lifts her chin and leans back against the headrest. She takes a deep breath. Debbie props her elbow on the windowsill and rubs her knuckles against her temple. She starts to smile, then presses her lips together and blinks back tears. Debbie takes the steering wheel in both hands and allows a hopeful smile. In his office, Pete sits at his desk glowering. He presses his lips together. Going to a wall, he takes down a framed piece of artwork. Now, Pete clutches the crude pen and ink drawing as he stands at his father's front door. On a stage, kids paint a set. Sadie's parents watch from a row in the back. Debbie stares at him. Now, the school's outdoor walkways bustle with kids around Sadie's age. Walking a more isolated path, Debbie spots a blonde boy with a prop. She steps in close.",

Elijah smiles even bigger. Audrey's eyes become utterly still. David stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the bathrooms and concession stands and back again. David stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against the wall. His shoulder leaves the wall. He steps out into the stream of people. Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move. David's eyes are looking down -- his expression still -- like he's listening. He's in the heaviest part of the movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass. And then it happens. A stocky woman bumps into him. Joseph turns to the thermometer boy. David nods. David stares at the white-haired nurse.

Joseph follows him with the barrel of the handgun. David stops moving. Joseph stops moving. Joseph's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face. Joseph looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks. Joseph starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back. Joseph freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Audrey then back to Joseph. David becomes still as his words register. David looks unsteady all of a sudden. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly. The top of the man's head doesn't move. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back. As he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair. The Ponytail man walks up to Elijah. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans over. The Ponytail man shakes his head, moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics. Elijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books.",
    "1099": "He steps on the cigarette. Having just pulled the cover over the car, he stares at Ashley incredulously, and steps over to the door. He spits and walks out. Ashley rolls her eyes. Walt opens his front door to a teenager, Thao. Walt slams the door and turns to the priest. Walt shoves past the fresh-faced priest, Father Janovich. Next door, a steady stream of Southeast Asian Hmong people walk up to the front door. Most carry plates or bowls of food. As mourners leave, Walt uses jump leads to get a woman's car started. Mitch drives up in a Toyota Land Cruiser. Walt straightens up and stares at the silver four-by-four as it departs. Walt puts his jump leads on a garden table, and walks up onto the back porch. Looks across at his neighbor and their friends gathered in the garden. Walt snarls. An elder in ceremonial dress prepares to slaughter a chicken. Next door, a grandmother talks to a middle-aged man. The extended family gather before the elder, Kor Khue. He shakes a hoop with metal rings on it. Beside him is a young woman holding a baby, which is wrapped in a brightly embroidered papoose. He lays the hoop on the carpet and throws a horn split in two into it. Thao walks out of the back door. With cupped hands, Kor Khue gestures to the mother and child. Beside them, the father raises his hands. Next door, Walt sweeps his drive with a broom. His Labrador Daisy scampers down the front steps. Walt looks at next door's garden as Thao walks up his front steps. The grass is thin and parched. Grandma sits on the porch and watches Walt. Grandma mutters to herself. Glaring at her, Walt spits. Grandma spits copiously. Walt grimaces. Inside, he leans down to Daisy by the front door. Walt opens the door to Father Janovich. Walt shuts the door. Thao wanders along by a high chain link fence, browsing through a book. A large black sedan with side exhaust pipes rolls up. Two heavy-duty Latino guys lean out of the window. Thao keeps walking. Thao smiles. A white car with five South Asian guys in it stops up ahead. The driver, Spider, has long black hair and wears a bandanna. He sees Thao. Spider drives down the road and stops beside the black sedan. He and the guy he was talking to, Smokie, lean out of the window. A Latino guy has a revolver. Smokie wields a machine pistol. The Latino guys speed off. Spider reverses up beside Thao. Thao walks on, and Spider gets out. They drive off and Thao keeps walking. Later, Thao's gardening. His sister Sue is sitting on the front steps, reading.",
    "874": "Kate slowly wakes up and takes in her surroundings and looks across at Zoe, who’s staring at her. Aunt and niece gaze at each other for a few moments, then Kate sits up and stares unblinkingly at the young girl. Tears roll down Zoe's face, and Kate nods sadly. Zoe's anguished face is crumpled as a tear trickles down Kate’s face. Kate walks wearily into her apartment, removes her long, red scarf from around her neck, and walks over to the answer machine. Transfixed, Kate stands in the hallway, clutching her coat, then turns and walks back towards the door. At the restaurant, they all turn and stare as Kate walks in and past them, while Paula puts her wineglass down. In the empty kitchen, Kate ties her apron around her waist, and without looking at Paula, Kate walks away. Concerned, Leah looks over at Kate, who seems distracted, her eyes filling with tears. Kate crouches on the floor of the walk-in fridge with Christine's letter, and Paula looks in at her through a window in the door. Distraught, Kate looks up as Paula enters, nodding, her chin quivering, while Paula takes hold of Kate's hands. In Zoe's hospital room, Kate walks in, goes to the end of Zoe’s bed, and places her bag down on the over-bed table. Kate takes the bag and places it on a chair by the window, puts her handbag beside it, and takes off her coat and scarf as she talks to Zoe. Zoe goes back to watching the Bugs Bunny cartoon as Kate sits in the chair beside her bed. Zoe looks away but gives a faint nod and turns back to the TV. A yellow taxicab drives along a New York street, with Zoe in the back seat, looking out through the rain-splashed window as if in a trance. The cab pulls up, and Zoe and Kate get out. Zoe slings a red rucksack over her shoulder and stands looking up at Kate’s apartment building, a smart brownstone with a wide set of steps leading up to an arched entranceway. Inside, Kate shows Zoe around the apartment, walks down a hallway, and Zoe walks slowly into her new bedroom, which is light and airy, with a large bay window and window seat and a huge double bed. At a cemetery high on a hill overlooking the city, Zoe stares morosely at her mother's casket, which sits by the graveside. As other mourners begin to disburse, Zoe turns to Kate, and the two of them walk slowly away. A large, lifelike, cuddly toy giraffe is carried up the steps of Kate's brownstone, followed by more toys and a bike being taken inside, while Zoe carries a stuffed elephant. A collection of cuddly toys is arranged around Zoe’s room.",
    "354": "Sam can't believe it—relief and joy flood through him. Smack! Out of nowhere, the figure of Smeagol crashes into them, sending Sam and Frodo sprawling. Smeagol pounces on Frodo, his fingers wrapping around Frodo's throat, snapping Frodo's neck from side to side. Frodo struggles to unlock the bony, white fingers around his neck, but Smeagol's grip is too strong. Smeagol's fingers tighten around Frodo's neck, squeezing the life out of him. Whack! A rock connects with the side of Smeagol's head. Sam jumps on a stunned Smeagol. The battle between men and orcs rages on. From Mordor, high overhead, the Nazgul fly out into the fray. All the old hatred between Sam and Smeagol boils over as they fight. Sam falls back, and Smeagol bites at him. Sam pushes Smeagol away with his feet, rolls to his knees, as Smeagol charges at him. Sam slashes out with Sting, cutting Smeagol across the stomach. Smeagol staggers back, screaming with pain. Sam looks around desperately for Frodo. The eagles engage the Nazgul. Sam is gasping, his lungs exploding as he races up the slopes of Mount Doom searching for Frodo. Sam arrives at the stone doorway of Sammath Naur leading into the mountain and staggers into it. Sam flinches against the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. Sam lurches forward towards an orange glow deep in the heart of the mountain. The heat is almost unbearable. Sam sees Frodo standing on the edge of the Crack of Doom, a deep lava-filled chasm in the very heart of ancient Sauron's forges, the greatest in Middle-earth. The raging orange glare from the chasm turns Frodo into a black silhouette, standing tense and still. Frodo holds the Ring in his hand and raises it over the bubbling lava far below, a strange expression on his face. The hum of the Ring grows louder and louder. Frodo pulls the Ring close to his body as he turns to Sam. Frodo looks at Sam; the Ring has finally taken him. Sam screams as Frodo puts the Ring on and vanishes. With a storm of wings, the Nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards Mount Doom. In the midst of the battle, Gandalf realizes Frodo has been seen. Footprints move across the ash-covered cavern. Suddenly, Gollum smashes a rock down on Sam's head, knocking him to the ground. Gollum leaps onto the invisible Frodo's footprints, clawing frantically, riding on the back of the invisible Frodo. Aragorn turns and is confronted by an armoured troll wielding an enormous mallet. Gollum suddenly lifts his hands to his face and bites.",
    "927": "Bond guns the engine and speeds off as the general points and roars, and an inflatable comes speeding after him. The general's men open fire while Camille and Bond struggle, causing the boat to swerve sideways. Bond regains control, and they duck a hail of bullets and stare straight at the inflatable. Camille takes out a gunman with a boat hook, then the inflatable turns for another run. The swerving boats kick up fountains of spray, and Bond crashes through more boats as their pursuers exchange frantic hand signals to coordinate a two-boat attack. Bond speeds at the two inflatables head-on, crashing between them and sending men sprawling. One gunman wrestles with his weapon as Bond rams an engine, which explodes. Bond grabs the wheel as the other boat closes in, the chase heading for the tightly packed marina. Bond throttles back, causing the other boat to rear-end them so hard it mounts their stern, knocking Camille down. With the two boats locked together, Bond grabs a grappling hook and throws it into the inflatable. The rope unrolls and becomes taut, hurling the inflatable away from their boat. Bond turns the boat around in calm water and heads away from the scene with barely a backward glance. With Camille unconscious in the bottom of the boat, Bond heads from a quiet inlet with rolling tree-covered highlands towards a landing stage near a development of opulent white buildings. He stops the boat at the jetty and carries Camille through crowds of retirement-aged tourists, dumping her on a puzzled member of staff. Bond walks past luxury yachts being maneuvered on trailers and consults the GPS tracker on his phone. He approaches a 4 by 4 with its door open, looks around the yard, then slips behind the wheel. He drives through rundown suburbs and makes a call to his neat glass-partitioned headquarters. Meanwhile, an agent heads for M's office, and two black 4 by 4s arrive at an airfield. Dominic Greene and his guard get out of the car; Greene walks onto an executive jet. The plane carrying Greene and the black agent with a beard takes off. The thin German adds sugar to coffee, turbulence hits as Greene returns from a comfort break, and the black agent glares at him. Greene looks noncommittal, while his colleague smiles coldly and shows Beam Bond's photo on his camera. The phone is tossed to the surly agent, who studies the picture, closes the phone, and hands it back, then eyeballs his colleague. The jet taxis outside a hangar, and Greene gets into a car, glancing up at the CIA agents and grinning. Felix gives a bitter smile, then follows Beam up the plane's steps.",
    "343": "Everything depends on Frodo going inside the tunnel. Frodo stares into the darkness. Gollum, his sparse oily hair hanging like rank weed over his hooded eyes, leads the way. Drawing a deep breath, Frodo follows Gollum into the tunnel. They continue on, deep into the dark tunnel. Frodo feels his way in the dark, following the sound of Gollum's scampering. Frodo follows the sound of Gollum's voice. He is very tired. Frodo cannot see Gollum in the murky tunnel. Frodo slips as he tries to follow the voice. He puts his hand to the wall to steady himself but quickly yanks it away. Strands of a white thread are stuck to his hand. Gollum is nowhere to be seen. Frodo is breathing hard, passing all manner of creatures trussed up in evil web-like material. There is a creaking as some great jointed thing moves with slow purpose in the dark. Frodo begins to run in blind panic. Meanwhile, Sam stumbles blindly down the ancient stairs, reckless and uncaring, his face pale and devastated. Sam's foot slips. Suddenly, as if the ground has given way beneath him, Sam is slipping and sliding dangerously out of control. Sam thuds into a large rock, which saves him from tumbling headlong over the precipice. Something catches Sam's eye, and he stares, barely breathing—a package of lembas bread. Sam looks back up the long steep stair. Frodo is running blindly; he falls, trapped in the sticky substance which clings to him. As he lays on the ground, unable to move, a voice comes to him as if from a distant memory. Frodo fumbles in his jacket, fear growing in him as he pulls out the glass phial—his gift from Galadriel—and holds it aloft. Gollum is on the other side of the web. Frodo slashes wildly with Sting. The shining blade of Sting hacks through the fibrous strands. They whip and snap back into Frodo's face as he cuts himself free. Back up the tunnel, lit by the Light of Galadriel, Shelob's heaving shadow approaches. Disbelief turns to fear as Shelob gets closer and closer; Gollum quickly turns and bolts. Frodo hacks at the web and, with a last desperate lunge, frees himself. Sting is caught in the web. Frodo leaves the sword and throws himself through a narrow crevice. Frodo stumbles out of Shelob's lair, tumbling onto cold rock, covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in sweat. He looks up as Gollum lunges at him. Gollum and Frodo fight, rolling on the ground towards the edge of a precipice. Frodo pins Gollum on the ground, hands around his throat. Frodo's fingers squeeze tighter around Gollum's, but he has a sudden moment of self-realization and releases Gollum, horrified at his violence.",
    "290": "Doyle gives her a scathing look and Jeff challenges Doyle. Lisa answers, but very coldly, as Doyle hesitates a moment, letting his eyes wander to the overnight case with Lisa's lingerie, before his eyes go back to Jeff. Jeff replies, pointedly, while Lisa looks down at Jeff, not comprehending. Meanwhile, Doyle is wiping his coat lapels with a handkerchief. Neither Jeff nor Lisa display even the slightest friendliness; their faces are cold and set. Doyle looks at them pleasantly, starts away toward the door, as Lisa, still burning, then speaks icily. Doyle picks up his hat, relaxed, and poises on the step, snapping his fingers. He starts up the steps to the door, puts on his hat, smiles, and says something before quietly closing the door behind him. Jeff turns his chair around and looks out to the neighborhood, with Lisa standing glumly behind him. None of the gaiety is reflected in Lisa and Jeff, despite it being a happy, gay affair at the songwriter's party, now in full swing and fairly crowded. Miss Torso's apartment has the door closed, and all we can see of her are her legs swinging in arcs as she exercises to record music. During this, she has been staring out at Thorwald's apartment, but Lisa is not looking in the same direction as Jeff. She murmurs to Jeff, and now her eyes are looking at the apartment underneath. Jeff turns his eyes in the same direction as hers, witnessing the surprise of seeing her return with a lover hooked, who is much younger than she and more keyed up to the promise of an adventure still fresh to him. A light has gone on in Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, and they look on. Her actions are coy and over-feminine, and as she sips her drink looking at him over the rim of the glass, he tosses his off with nervous dispatch. He moves toward her more cautiously this time, leading to an embrace and a long kiss. He begins kissing her cheek, ear, and neck, but suddenly and fiercely she pushes him away, slapping him across the face. He moves back with shock as she loudly and emphatically orders him out. He flushes with anger and embarrassment, his mouth twisting into unpleasant shapes as he slaps degrading words back at her, telling her what she is, and she screams at him to get out. He leaves, slamming the door behind him, as she goes back dumbly to the spilled liquor, making a futile effort to clean it up before collapsing onto the rug, sobbing hard enough to shake her whole body. Meanwhile, Lisa turns away from Jeff's chair to get a cigarette from the table.",
    "404": "She goes back into the room and begins taking things up, flinging down men's clothes, leather trousers, a suitcase, and a teddy bear. Fergus looks to the man down in the street, a parody of rejection with his things in his arms. Dil grabs a large goldfish bowl and flings it down, which breaks to bits on the pavement, and goldfish thrash around in the street. Upstairs, Dil closes the window shut. Fergus stands as Dil hands him a glass, and he walks past the photograph and sits down. He looks from her to the picture, nods toward it, and she looks down into her drink. They fall into one another's arms, and she stretches up with her whole body over him as they grow suddenly and violently passionate, with the photograph above them seeming to smile. He draws up her dress with his hands, but she suddenly pulls away, comes up toward him once more, opens the buttons on his shirt, and her mouth travels down his chest. Fergus tries to draw her up toward him, but her hand reaches up to his mouth and presses his head back while her other hand undoes his pants, kisses his stomach, and her mouth moves down his body. Fergus stares at the picture of Jody, whose eyes seem to burn through him. Dil raises her head and kisses his mouth, with tears in his eyes. She sits in front of the mirror, and Fergus gets up, stands behind her, and gently pushes the hair from her face. She embraces him, sits back down in front of the mirror, and Fergus leaves as she reapplies her lipstick. A singer in a blue dress performs while Dil and Fergus are by the bar, both drinking drinks with umbrellas. Dave comes up behind them with his neck brace, stands, and steps two feet back, while Fergus takes Dil's arm. The woman is singing, Dil holds her cheek close to his, looks at him out of the corner of her eye, draws back, looks at him, and dances closer. In the bar, people sing along with the music as Col sings, and Dave sits at the bar sulking. She puts her cheek against his, and Dave slams his drink down, stands up to leave, and on the stage, the act finishes. Dil draws Fergus back to the bar, Col, the barman, pours her drink, and Col pours and smiles. He drinks, grimaces, she throws it back in one, takes the bottle herself, fills their glasses, slams it back, and he sips as she tilts his glass back, and he swallows it in one. She enters; Fergus walks in slowly, and he looks from the cricket whites that are hanging up behind a curtain to the photographs.",
    "352": "Their attention is fixed on the plain below where thousands of orcs can be seen marching away from Mount Doom. Frodo and Sam move across a hellish dry landscape of twisted volcanic rock and steaming fissures. Forty miles away, Mount Doom rises out of the plain, its feet founded in ashen ruin, its huge cone rising to a great height, where its reeking head is swathed in cloud. Aragorn's force of 500 approaches the great Black Gates of Mordor and he positions his troops about half a mile from the gates. Frodo is slumped against a rock and tries to drink from his water bottle but finds it empty; he gratefully takes a small sip from Sam's bottle. There is a moment of eye contact between Frodo and Sam as they acknowledge what lies ahead, and Sam offers Frodo his hand and pulls him up. At the Black Gates, Aragorn musters his men. Frodo and Sam stagger across the tortured landscape, no longer wearing the orc armor. Frodo is walking half-bowed, often stumbling, as if his eyes no longer see the way before his feet. His right hand is pressed against his chest, supporting a heavy weight, while his left hand often rises as if to ward off some invisible blow. Sam watches him, concern etched across his face, as Frodo hears a malevolent voice in his head calling to him. Sam looks behind him in time to see a ray of red light stab through the gloom and begin to sweep over the barren landscape. Sam throws himself to the ground, and Frodo turns to the light, unable to stop himself, crumpling to the ground as the red light hits him like a searchlight. All is quiet as Gandalf is watchful, nodding at Aragorn. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop towards the Black Gates, pulling up less than 50 yards from the towering gates. Frodo is slumped on the ground, unable to move, as Aragorn moves his horse forward. From behind the huge gates, the terrifying chanting and clanging of the armor of thousands can be heard. With the sound of tortured metal, the massive gates begin to open. Legolas, Merry, and Eomer look on in trepidation as the Eye of Sauron sweeps the plains around them, and Sam gets to his feet. The Black Gates of Mordor swing open and Sauron's army of 300,000 emerges. Aragorn, Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin gallop back towards their small army as the orc masses slowly march toward them. Behind them, the Eye of Sauron is directed toward them. Frodo's eyes open with a start as Sam crawls toward him. Frodo and Sam stagger to their feet and move off as the massive orc army marches towards Aragorn's men, who are starting to waver as the orcs encircle them.",
    "716": "Meanwhile, water floods the cargo hold, knocking down the two stewards. In the front well deck, Jack pushes Rose back as the ship breaks off chunks of ice, which land on the deck and knock down two men. The ship continues moving alongside the iceberg. In the engine room, water pours in as a man scrambles past furnace stokers swept across. Jack runs to the starboard railing and watches as the back of the ship moves alongside the iceberg. Murdoch runs to the bridge and moves a lever, which closes the hydraulic watertight doors in the engine room. A man motions to the stokers. Workers run through the rising water and crawl under the lowering doors. He follows the others through one of the doorways. The door closes, leaving several stokers behind. As the others escape past closing doors, the remaining stoker dives under the last closing door and falls out as its steel hatch slams shut. On the bridge, a row of lights blinks on the watertight door indicator panel. Murdoch stares at the panel, then turns away. On the passenger deck, a man and a woman lean over the starboard rail and peer at the iceberg. In the crow's nest, Fleet turns to Lee. Jack, Rose, and the two men peer over the railing at the iceberg, now behind the ship. On the bridge, Murdoch addresses Moody. Moody glances at a wall clock as he exits. Hichens turns to the bridge door as Captain Smith enters. Murdoch follows Smith onto the bridge deck. Smith peers down from the bridge deck shelter, then stands at the bridge railing, overlooking the front well deck. Murdoch hurries off. In his cabin, Fabrizio jumps down from his bunk into inch-deep water and turns on the overhead light. His roommates follow as he opens the door. Tommy approaches. The countess steps out of her stateroom and stops a mustached steward. Andrews hurries past, carrying blueprints. Outside, smoke rises from the ship's huge funnels as people gather on the decks. Tommy, Fabrizio, and others follow running rats down a hallway. Cal and Lovejoy step out of the sitting room and stop a dark-haired steward in the hallway. The steward hurries off. On the upper deck, a dark-haired man tosses a blond man a chunk of ice. He tosses the ice back. Smith, Moody, Andrews, and Murdoch pass Jack and Rose. The master-at-arms studies Jack's drawings. Cal snatches the drawings from him. Holding hands, Jack and Rose approach Lovejoy, who stands in the hallway. Lovejoy walks alongside Jack and slips the heart of the ocean into Jack's coat pocket. Lovejoy follows Rose and Jack into the sitting room. Cal steps forward. Cal glances at Lovejoy, who arches his eyebrows.",
    "1079": "A wooden loading tunnel leads right to it. As Fletcher stares, policemen emerge from their office. Administrator Allsop looks down his telescope. Drover gallops through Carney's men and cuts the rope holding up the gate at the end of the tunnel. It drops closed, trapping the cattle inside. Drover cracks his whip as Sarah's cattle thunder down the wharf. Townspeople cheer her on as she rides past the hotel. The cattle are streaming onto a ship. Nullah rides up to Sarah. She nods and smiles triumphantly as Nullah rides behind the last of the herd. She catches Fletcher's eye. They glare at each other, and she rides towards him. He looks nervous, then blinks as she cracks her whip right in front of his face. She rides off, eyeballing him with a grin. Nullah chases the last steer onto the ship. Drover escorts Sarah to the pub through the cheering mob. She smiles with pride as two glasses are placed on the bar, and filled with Poor Fella Rum. They down the powerful brew, gasping at the strength. They laugh, staring into each other's eyes. Fletcher answers the phone at the holding yard. Carney glares down at him from the veranda of his house. Fletcher stands, shoulders slumped, by the phone. Sarah, with tears of joy in her eyes, throws her arms around Drover. Drover exercises Capricornia in a small yard. Sarah steps out on the balcony above, and watches him nuzzle the horse affectionately. She makes her way downstairs. He gets the mare to lie down. Sarah watches in amazement. He looks round, startled. He frowns and turns away. He breaks eye contact, and nods thoughtfully. He looks her in the eye and walks off, leaving her uncomfortable and disappointed. Nullah's sitting glumly by a cooking fire with Sing Song and Bandy Legs. She dips her fingers in ash. She smears black ash on his cheek, and smiles. A man watches nearby. He looks at her with his big eyes. Sitting downstairs in the black section of the audience with Sing Song, Bandy turns and looks up at the black Nullah. Sitting in the rafters near the projector, he watches wide-eyed. Everyone turns and stares as Carney swigs from a wine bottle. He approaches Sarah, who plonks his bottle on a waiter's tray. He holds out his hand. She eyes him warily. Sarah frowns as King, smiling broadly, leads her to the dance floor. Fletcher watches from the punchbowl. A photographer takes their picture. She sits and stares, thinking hard. Allsop pauses and stares. Everyone in the garden turns and looks up at the house. Sarah turns round and gasps, standing and staring. At the top of the steps leading to the garden, clean-shaven and wearing a white tuxedo, is the Drover.",
    "1177": "A horrible face appears, growing out of the back of Quirrell's head, with eyes sunk in dark sockets, and the skin stretched over the bony skull as Harry turns to run. A sheet of flame blocks his way, and they appear in the mirror. Harry takes the red stone in his pocket and looks at it as his parents disappear. Quirrell flies through the air and detects Harry, who falls over backwards, causing the glowing philosopher's stone to drop from his hand. He stretches out desperately to reach it, but Quirrell is trying to choke him. Harry grabs Quirrell's hand, which surprises him, causing Quirrell to pull away. Quirrell holds out his hand in front of him and sees it crumble into grey dust. Quirrell lurches towards the stone, and Harry's hands push against Quirrell's face, which also disintegrates into dust. Harry stares at his own hands in horror as Quirrell reaches out towards him and then crashes to the ground, his whole body turned to a pile of dust, and Voldemort has also disappeared. Puzzled, Harry stares at his hands again, then looks around for the philosopher's stone, seeing the dark red crystal lying on the stairs with a small flame flickering inside it. Harry picks it up, looks at it for a moment, smiles with relief, and clutches it tightly in his hand. He turns quickly as the cloud of swirling dust gathers behind him, and Voldemort's face appears and screams towards Harry in a violent rushing wind, knocking him off balance. The wind seems to pass through Harry's body, which whirls away like a tornado up the stone steps and disappears, leaving Harry unconscious but still holding in his hand the philosopher's stone, which flickers and glows a rich, deep red. When Harry wakes, he's in bed in the hospital wing. He rubs his eyes, with his face pale and a bandage on one hand. He sits up, reaches for his spectacles, puts them on, and smiles as he sees the get-well cards and the table at the bottom of his bed piled high with boxes of sweets. Professor Dumbledore walks in, sees the sweets, picks up an empty box, sits on Harry's bed, and Harry touches his scar. Dumbledore touches Harry's head, gets up, and chews thoughtfully. Wearing his black cloak, Harry walks along a corridor and sees Ron and Hermione talking together on an upper landing. Smiling happily, he stops and looks up at them. They catch sight of him, and Harry's smile gets even wider. At a bank within the great hall, the students are wearing their robes and pointed hats. At the high table, Professor Dumbledore gets to his feet and looks around, while Malfoy smirks and the Gryffindors join in the applause halfheartedly.",
    "1237": "Emily stops on the steps of her house, and their eyes lock as Ben stands, looking up at her apologetically while Emily looks disappointed. Her eyes linger on him briefly before she turns and goes inside, leaving Ben standing, looking up at the door. Ben then gets into his saloon, angrily tugs at his seat belt to fasten it, and screams. Inside, a middle-aged woman sits at a table in Emily's kitchen, and Emily clears the plates, taking them to the sink and leaving the nurse, Kate, at the table. Emily looks out of the window to see Ben working in the garden, and she watches him before walking through to the French windows in the living room and going out into the lush garden where Ben is bending from the waist down and pulling up weeds, tugs out more weeds, smiles, and carries on working. Emily watches him and then turns back to look at him. Ben, whose shirt sleeves are rolled up to his elbows, follows her to double wooden doors, which she unlocks with a padlock. Shafts of hazy, golden light flood into the workshop as they enter, and Emily takes paper, pedals a flywheel, and prints an angelic woman with butterfly wings, which Ben studies. Ben meets her gaze, and Emily smiles impishly. In a large, sunny field, Emily sits in long grass watching Ben play with Duke, who bounds to retrieve something, and Emily smiles gleefully as they sit in shade with Duke beneath a tree. Ben shakes his head, nods faintly, and watches her intently as she folds her cardigan around her. Emily glances at Ben and plays with a blade of grass. They look into each other's eyes, and Ben nods, but Emily looks away as her long, dark hair frames her soft features, and she draws a strand of hair back behind her ear. Ben studies her as she speaks, then lowers his eyes. Emily looks down and smiles wistfully, and Ben reaches out his hand, briefly caressing her hair. Later, Duke's head sticks out of Ben's car window as they drive along the avenue of palm trees to Emily's quaint clapboard house and pull up outside it. Emily gives Ben a sweet, uncertain smile and nods before beaming and leaning over to kiss him on the cheek. Ben looks emotional as she gets out, retrieves Duke from the back seat, and looks in through the open front passenger window. Ben watches Emily go, then turns away pensively, with a faint smile flickering across his features before driving off. Ben sits in the sunny field, smiling to himself. Later, Ben's saloon pulls up outside Emily's house, and he kills the lights, removes his seat belt, and sneaks through Emily's pretty garden towards the workshop, carrying a shoulder bag as soft light shines out from the house.",
    "348": "The first volley of arrows hit the Rohan soldiers as the charge continues. Gandalf wheels around on Shadowfax and pulls Pippin onto the horse. The Rohan charge is decimating the enemy. Meanwhile, Denethor stands on the table astride Faramir, pouring oil over his own head, which runs through his hair and down his face, quickly soaking his robes. Faramir's eyes flicker open, and as he tries to focus through his delirium, oil splashes onto his chest and bundles of oil-soaked wood are stacked all around them. Servants hold flaming torches, awaiting their orders. Denethor nods to them, and the servants approach the pyre with torches held firmly. At that moment, Gandalf and Pippin burst into the hallows, astride Shadowfax. The fearful servants back away from the pyre, but with a roar, Denethor snatches a flaming torch and hurls it at the pyre. The pyre ignites as Gandalf gallops toward it, knocking Denethor to his feet. Pippin leaps from Shadowfax onto the burning pyre with desperate strength, pushing Faramir off. They tumble down the bundles of wood onto the floor, and Pippin douses flames on Faramir's clothing. Denethor screams with rage and leaps across the pyre, ripping and tugging at Pippin. Fire spreads up Denethor's oil-soaked back as he hauls Pippin off Faramir. Shadowfax rears up and strikes at Denethor, who falls back onto the pyre. He looks into his son's eyes, and for a brief moment, sanity returns before the flames engulf him. Suddenly, Denethor lurches off the pyre, a screaming, unguided ball of flame, and runs across the chamber, disappearing out of the door. Denethor runs across the white court atop Minas Tirith and plummets straight over the 700-foot sheer drop into the flaming city below. Denethor's death plunge signals the Rohirrim gaining the upper hand, as vast numbers of orcs are slain or are fleeing. Theoden stands proud in his saddle, yelling to his Rohirrim, but his look of joy turns to horror as massive elephant-like creatures, each carrying a war-tower packed with Haradrim archers, appear across the vast sea of battle. Theoden on his horse circles amongst them while Gandalf looks at the small hobbit. Pippin looks up at Gandalf questioningly, and Gandalf sees the fear in Pippin’s eyes. Gandalf breaks off, lost in reverie, as Pippin stares up at the old wizard's face, softened, quiet, and full of peace. Gandalf and Pippin's faces turn as the wooden doors shudder under another blow. The battlefield is in chaos as Mumakil decimate the valiant Rohirrim. Theoden tries to rally his men amid the sea of crying men and neighing horses when suddenly the Witch-King swoops down on his Nazgul, scooping up Theoden and his horse.",
    "59": "Mulwray says something to the boy and points to the ground, after which the boy gestures. Mulwray then kneels down in the mud, stares at it, and seems to concentrate on it. After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy, and heads swiftly back upstream, scrambling up the bank to his car. There, he reaches through the window, pulls out a roll of blueprints or something similar, spreads them on the hood of his car, and begins to scribble notes while looking downstream from time to time. He drives off, pulls up, and parks. Gittes looks to his right where the bay is a long, clear crescent. Hesitating, Gittes moves in that direction but climbs along the promontory to be above Mulwray, who looks absently up toward Gittes. There's a promontory of sorts where Mulwray picks up a starfish and watches the water trickling down from the outfall near Gittes. Mulwray stands, fascinated by the water, which, even as Gittes watches Mulwray, increases in volume and velocity until it gushes in spurts, cascading into the sea and whipping it into a foam. Mulwray finds himself in a puddle of water with the seat of his trousers wet. There's a slip of paper stuck under the windshield wiper, which Gittes pulls off. He gets in the car, turns on the dash light, reaches down, and opens his glove compartment, which consists of a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches, with the cheap price tags still attached. Gittes pulls out one, winds it absentmindedly, checks the time with his own watch—it’s 9:37—and walks to Mulwray’s car where he places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car. Walsh shows him a series of photos taken outside a restaurant showing Mulwray with another man of striking appearance, and in two of the photos, a gnarled cane is visible. Gittes tosses down the photos in disgust. Meanwhile, Duffy is rowing with Gittes seated in the stern as they pass Mulwray with a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress, with Mulwray fondly doting on her while drifting in their rowboat. Gittes shoots past Duffy, expertly running off a couple of fast shots. Mulwray and the girl remain blissfully unaware of them as they turn again and row past the couple, Gittes clicking off several more fast shots. The scene moves along the red-tiled roof and down to a lower level where Gittes’ feet are hooked over the apex of the roof, with him stretched face downward on the tiles, pointing himself and his camera at a veranda below where the girl and Mulwray are eating.",
    "1200": "Jenny takes a gold necklace out of a box, but wagging his tail playfully, Marley gets the necklace. John trips on a chair and the chase is on around the living room. The dog easily outmaneuvers Jenny, but John grabs him and forces open his jaws. John sprays Marley's poop with a hose, looking for the necklace. The doctor holds a probe to Jenny's stomach and moves a scanner around on gel on Jenny's stomach. A fuzzy picture appears on a screen, but the doctor frowns and removes the scanner, then walks out, leaving the Grogans waiting anxiously in the examination room. The doctor returns, smiles reassuringly, and places the scanner on Jenny's stomach. Jenny nods, tight-lipped, and the doctor withdraws with a sympathetic smile of apology. Jenny glances at her husband, who's lost for words as they drive down a palm tree-lined road. John glances at Jenny and gropes to break the silence; without looking at him, she settles back against her headrest and stares out of the window. They drive on down the sunny freeway toward the city. Back home, John opens the front door for his wife. Marley jumps up at him, but he pushes the dog aside. Jenny shrugs and slumps onto the sofa. Eyes full of concern, John turns around from filling the kettle at the sink. Jenny sits blankly, petting Marley, who rests his chin on her knee. As she starts to cry, she leans forward and hugs the big Labrador. John walks over and sits next to her, stroking her back, and she leans against him as he rubs her arm soothingly. A young dark-haired woman gets out carrying a bag and a suitcase, and Marley chases Debbie around the house trying to pull off her bath towel; he wins the game. Debbie offers the sedatives, and Marley's eating the sofa. The elderly Irish landlady leaves them to their quaintly decorated twin room, and John winces at the noise of the springs as Jenny sits on the bed. They kiss, snuggled in the floral quilt on Jenny's single bed beneath a portrait of the Virgin Mary. A yellow taxi arrives at the Grogans' home, and the house is a chewed mess. Marley stands at the front door, wagging his tail, and then stands with his head tilted back at a rain-lashed window. The dog runs under the desk where John's working and climbs onto John's lap. Jenny comes out of the bathroom holding up a pregnancy kit, and John takes her in his arms, lifting her clean off the floor. The Grogans are asleep as Marley busies himself chewing some of John's socks, and then he headbutts open his food bin, knocking some books off a shelf in the process.",
    "1106": "Walt kicks a table, then marches into his front room and kicks over another table, then punches in some cupboard doors as Daisy runs for cover. Walt sits down in an armchair, blood dripping from his fingers, and stares into the distance, a frown on his face, his features fixed and grim. He sheds a tear, and the blood on his fists has dried. Daisy comes and sits beside him. Father Janovich knocks at Walt's door and lets himself in as Walt lights up a cigarette. Father Janovich perches on a coffee table beside an open photograph album and stares at Walt, who drags pensively on his cigarette and looks thoughtful. Father Janovich gets up, goes over to the cool box, returns with four cans, and passes a couple to Walt while keeping a couple for himself. They each take a swig, and Walt takes another swig as Father Janovich eyes him, who stares unwaveringly back. In the morning, Thao walks into Walt's kitchen and finds him sipping a mug of coffee. They sit at the kitchen table, Walt gives Thao a scornful look, Thao nods reluctantly, and then gets up and goes as Walt stares after him. Later, Walt is busy mowing his front lawn, and now he relaxes in the bath, lights a cigarette, and looks over at Daisy, who's sitting beside the tub. Martin gives Walt a haircut, chuckles, and pockets the money. At a tailor's, Walt is fitted for a suit. In church, Father Janovich walks up the aisle reading a Bible, looks up, and sees Walter in a confessional booth. They step out of the confessional, Walt walks away, looks back at Father Janovich, smiles, and goes. Walt sits at his kitchen table cleaning his Colt .45, Thao comes in through the back door, picks up Walt's rifle off the table, and shoulders the rifle, inadvertently pointing it at Walt. Thao follows Walt down into the basement, Walt shows him a medal, and pins it on Thao. Walt goes upstairs as Thao closes up the chest Walt took the medal from. Thao hurries up the stairs and finds that Walt has locked him in the basement. Walt walks out of his house with Daisy on a lead, goes over to Thao's house, where Grandma is sitting on the porch, ties Daisy to Grandma's chair, fusses Daisy, heads off, and Daisy lies down and watches him go. Sue is lying in bed, gets up and goes outside, her swollen face discolored and bruised, and Grandma follows her. She hurries to Walt's house, and Father Janovich is with the police outside Smokie's house as they bundle him into their cruiser and drive away.",
    "302": "The newlyweds' apartment has the shades still drawn, although there's a light burning inside. Jeff has a slight, but warm, smile on his face as he looks at the drawn shade. His eyes move away from the newlyweds' apartment and slowly explore the neighborhood to his right. His face sobers at what he sees. He finds something of interest and stops to stare at it. The salesman has prepared a dinner tray and is carrying it from the kitchen, through the living room, into the bedroom, in his apartment where we see both the living room and the bedroom. He places it on the lap of his wife, sitting up in bed, and puts a couple of pillows behind her back to make her more comfortable. Her attitude shows her dissatisfaction, and she begins criticizing him. He starts to answer her back but decides better of it and instead leaves the room. The wife grudgingly begins to eat the dinner. The husband quietly lifts a phone from the cradle and dials a number. Quietly, she moves the tray, gets out of bed, and goes to the bedroom door to listen. He goes to the kitchen, reaches up to a wall cabinet, takes down a bottle, and pours himself a drink. In the bedroom, his wife becomes aware of the call, and instantly there is a marked change in his attitude. We get a better view of the salesman waiting while his connection is being made. He relaxes, smiles, and is warm. Whoever he has called answers. He talks softly, perhaps guardedly, with an occasional glance at the bedroom door. Jeff becomes completely absorbed with what he sees and leans forward a little. The wall hides her from our view. Then suddenly, she apparently opens the door because, in the living room, we see her arm suddenly appear, pointing at the man and the telephone. He speaks quickly into the phone and hangs up. His face is flushed and angry as he goes toward the bedroom. In the bedroom, his wife appears walking back to the bed, followed by the husband. She is laughing, and he is answering her in angry tones. The more she laughs, the more angry he gets, and the harder she laughs. She climbs in bed laughing. Finally, he leaves the room, goes into the living room, back into the kitchen, and has another drink. He turns his eyes in the direction of the composer's apartment. Through the studio window of the songwriter's apartment, we see the man at work again on his original melody, and he is farther along the line of the melody than before. Lisa is emerging from the kitchen, carrying the serving dish of their lobster thermidor.",
    "805": "Skip pulls up on a busy street and gets out. Ferris walks into an apartment, throws keys on a table, and looks around. At the U.S. Embassy in Amman, Ferris and Skip in a silver Audi roll up to a checkpoint where Skip shows his ID. An older agent, Holiday, perches on a desk in a meeting room, and after the meeting, Skip walks out. Images of people coming and going from a house are displayed on a screen as Holiday stares at Ferris, then picks up his coat and walks out. Ferris watches him go, then picks up a file and a case as Skip comes back in. A black SUV drives through a checkpoint and up to the entrance of a grand building. Ferris, who still has cuts on his forehead, gets out of the SUV holding a briefcase. He walks up steps to an entrance hall where a tall bearded man, Marwan, Hani's bodyguard, is waiting. Marwan leads Ferris through a meeting room and slides back a glass door, allowing Ferris to step out into an ornate garden where a suave, middle-aged man sits at a table reading a newspaper. Ferris bows to him, then sits as Marwan waits in the meeting room. Hani nods, glances at the building, and pours Ferris a cup of coffee. They walk through the glass door and into the meeting room, where Marwan slides the door shut. Ferris takes a thick file from his case, and with his brow furrowed, Hani opens the file and looks through photographs of groups of men. He studies Ferris, and they both nod. In the surveillance room, Skip and Ferris drive along a narrow street that opens out onto a market square, where they stop and look across at a large, flat-roofed building. Ferris and Skip stand at a coffee store, while nearby, a man dressed in black sits reading. A young guy sits beside the man they're watching, who then briskly stands and runs off, pushing a guy over as he goes. Hoffman watches on the large surveillance screen as the streets are viewed from above. Ferris runs after the man but loses him in a crowd as Skip approaches from another direction. The man keeps running, and Ferris yells to Skip. The man runs down a quiet alley, rounds a corner, and pushes a cyclist over. Ferris sprints after him, and the man climbs over a high wall. Ferris follows, and as the man swipes at Ferris with a knife, two dogs attack. Ferris slams the man against a wall, yanks his arm up behind his back, and a dog sinks its teeth into Ferris' ankle. He grabs the knife, stabs the man repeatedly, and also stabs the dog biting him. Ferris clambers up on the wall, and the dogs bite his ankles.",
    "1119": "The envelope folds itself into a mouth and turns to Ginny, then it blows a raspberry in Ron's face before shredding itself into tiny pieces and fluttering down onto the table. Hermione looks at Ron sympathetically in a crowded classroom, where the door opens, and the girls are entranced as he flashes his teeth while the boys scowl. He taps a cage, uncovers a cage full of tiny blue creatures, and opens the door of the cage. The pixies fly out in all directions, tearing up books and lifting Neville Longbottom into the air by his ears, carrying him across the room. The students flap at the pixies ineffectually as the creatures hang Neville by the back of his cloak from the light fitting. The air is full of torn pages and flying pixies, with one pulling Hermione's hair, which Harry swipes away. Lockhart's spell has no effect as a pixie grabs his wand and a dragon skeleton falls in a clatter of bones and dust. Lockhart turns and runs up a flight of stairs, grabbing a photo of himself that a pixie has snatched from the wall, then looks down at Harry, Ron, and Hermione before running out. Hermione points her wand, and above their heads, the pixies freeze and float harmlessly in mid-air. Still hanging from the ceiling, Neville looks down at them mournfully as the Gryffindor captain, Oliver Wood, leads his team out for an early morning practice and spots the Slytherin team. Ron looks at Hermione as Draco Malfoy steps forward, and Harry stares at him and their broomsticks. Draco narrows his eyes and glares at Hermione, prompting Ron to pull out his wand in shock. Ron flies backwards, and the Slytherins laugh while Ron looks as if he's going to be sick and spits out a huge slug. Colin takes a photograph as Ron spits out another slug, and Harry and Hermione help Ron away while the laughing Slytherins watch them go. In Hagrid's cottage, he hands Ron a wooden bucket and sits down as Hermione gets up and walks away thoughtfully. Hagrid looks serious and takes Hermione's hand, and with her eyes full of tears, she gives him a faint smile. In Gilderoy Lockhart's room, Lockhart autographs a picture of himself as Harry looks up, hearing a strange voice, and Lockhart looks confused. The professor and student look around nervously before leaving Lockhart's room, where Harry stops as he hears the voice again, seeming to come from the stone wall. Following the sound, Harry bumps into Ron and Hermione, then runs off with his friends hurrying after him, Harry well ahead. He turns into a wide corridor and starts to walk along it as Ron and Hermione catch up with him. Suddenly, Harry stops them, and they look down in surprise to see a line of spiders following each other at their feet.",
    "1183": "All the boys are fast asleep except for Harry. He is sitting in his pajamas on the wide-stone sill gazing out of the window with his knees tucked up under his chin. Sitting beside him, his pet snowy owl turns its head as he gently strokes its soft, white feathers. As Harry looks out through the diamond shaped window panes across the moonlit courtyard at the school, he gives a contented smile. Next morning, Harry and Ron are late for class. A tabby cat is sitting on the teacher's desk. It looks up as they open the classroom door. Hermione looks at them disapprovingly as they hurry into the room. The cat leaps off of the table and turns into Professor McGonagall. Later, the dark figure of Professor Snape sweeps into his classroom. He fixes his eyes on Malfoy who smiles slyly. Harry takes careful notes. Snape spots him. Hermione nudges Harry. He puts his quill back in the inkwell. Hermione holds up her hand. Hermione knows. Hermione is desperate to answer. The great hall. Seamus peers into a goblet. Seamus' face is smudged with soot. Owls carrying mail flutter in through a high window. A parcel is dropped to one of the children below. The graceful birds swoop amongst the carved oak beams and fly from one end of the great hall to the other, delivering letters and parcels to their delighted owners. Ron has received a newspaper and some letters. He puts the newspaper to one side. Harry picks it up. Neville unwraps a small glass ball. It turns red. Hermione looks at them both with narrowed eyes. In the school grounds, a neat woman with spiky silver hair strides across the lawn. Harry's broom leaps straight into his hand. Malfoy catches his broomstick. The others keep trying. Ron's broom flies up and smacks him on the nose. Neville's broomstick lifts him into the air. Terrified he rises even higher. The broom carries him higher above their heads. He hangs on for dear life. The broom swings him round in circles and crashes into the side of a stone tower. It spins away just to turn again then dives towards the ground. Madam Hooch takes out her hound. The children scatter. The broomstick carries Neville, and zooms up over the statues on the battlements. His cloth gets caught on the sword and he drops the broomstick. The cloak rips and gives way. He plummets down and crashes heavily to the ground. Her cloak flying, Madam Hooch runs across to Neville and gently lifts him up. Malfoy finds the Remembrall. Malfoy mounts his broom. He flies on top of their heads. Harry steps astride his broomstick. Harry zooms after Malfoy.",
    "790": "He looks at the open safe door and smiles. Marcus smiles and nods. Willie heads out of the office, and Marcus begins filling a sack with wads of dollar bills from the safe. Willie walks up to a display of elephant soft toys. Some are purple, and some are pink. Willie picks up a purple one and examines it. He puts the purple elephant back and picks up a pink one. He stares at the toy for a moment, and then, smiling softly to himself, he turns to go. The sound of a revolver being cocked brings him to an abrupt hold. Marcus is holding a gun on him. Lois is behind Marcus with the handcart. Willie shakes his head slowly. Marcus' face softens, then he raises the gun. Willie closes his eyes. The police appear. Marcus hides behind the handcart and takes potshots at the cops who return fire. Willie runs holding the pink elephant, which gets its head blown off. He hides around a corner and catches his breath. A cop spots him and takes a shot, which blows the trunk of the wall beside Willie, who runs on. The statues in the nativity stable scene are smashed, which gets in the way. Later, he jumps out of the store's backdoor, and, still clutching the toy elephant, leaps into the BMW. He starts it up and speeds off. A police officer reaches out his way, and the BMW smashes the door off a squad car as Willie makes his escape. The cop shatters the BMW's back window. Willie drives on, and the cops speed after him. He glances back at the pursuing cruisers. The BMW rounds the corner onto Thurmond's street, raising smoke from its tires in the process. It races on down the street with the cruisers in hot pursuit. Willie pulls up outside Thurmond's house. Unable to get the car door open, he scrambles out of the driver's window clutching the pink elephant. Some children at a neighboring house come out to see what the commotion is all about. They watch as the cops cut Santa down in a hail of hot blood. He takes several bullets. Still clutching the elephant, Willie crawls towards Thurmond's front door. The gun-toting cops close in on him. Willie reaches the front step, but he's too badly injured to go any further. He collapses and lies motionless. The posse of cops surrounds him, keeping him covered as the screen fades slowly. Daytime, a close-up of the blood-soaked pink elephant. Thurmond opens a box on his bed. Thurmond cleans his bicycle as a skaterat walks up. Thurmond looks around. Thurmond gets to his feet. Thurmond looks down. Thurmond kicks the skaterat hard in the balls.",
    "976": "In the evening at the retirement home, an older Doris calls to Benjamin. A grainy flashback shows lightning hitting a truck. Benjamin looks out a window and sees a taxi pull up outside. Daisy, now in her 20s, exits the taxi and walks along the sidewalk toward the house. Benjamin moves to the next window to track her progress, watching as she enters through the gate. He goes downstairs and looks through the kitchen window at her. Daisy greets Mrs. Maple's dog, and Benjamin goes out to meet her. She steps closer with uncertainty, looking shocked, and then hugs him. She picks lint off his shirt, sees it, and laughs. Benjamin sits on the bed, and Daisy sits beside him, looking at an illustration and appearing pleasantly surprised. That night, a taxi pulls up outside a posh restaurant where Daisy and Benjamin exit. A waiter lights a cigarette for Daisy, and she turns her head to blow out the smoke. Outside, she walks onto a band stand. Benjamin watches as she removes her shoes, with light reflecting off water revolving on the ceiling. She takes off her jacket, and Benjamin is transfixed as Daisy dances, legs crossed, arching her body back with arms outstretched. She straightens, moves gracefully towards him with arms waving, leans to her left, and slowly raises her right leg into the air, her legs and arms almost parallel. She twists her body, arcs her leg, looks around at Benjamin, and sinks to her knees, arching her back to lie on the floor before sitting up again. She stands and walks towards him, crouches beside him on the band stand, and plants a lingering kiss on his lips; they part, their faces remaining close. He looks down, and she pulls away, stands, puts on her jacket, and picks up her shoes before walking down off the band stand. Meanwhile, Thomas uses a crutch, glances at an amputee in a wheelchair at a restaurant, and Benjamin smiles as Thomas looks pensive. Thomas shows him a collection of military uniforms and switches on the lights in his factory. Benjamin stares blankly at Thomas, who stands half hidden in shadow, then turns away awkwardly. Thomas shakes his head ruefully as Benjamin looks around the factory, then back at Thomas. Benjamin observes photos in a hallway, including one of a bride and a framed photo of Thomas and Caroline on their wedding day at Thomas's home. In the retirement home, Benjamin climbs the stairs to go to his room.",
    "276": "The low wide shot crops the BIKER at his shins, with the gas station in the background behind him. The Biker pauses for a moment, thinking or feeling. CRASH - the bathroom door flies open as the Biker bursts in astride his hog, bright daylight streaming in with him to throw him into imposing silhouette. Shafts of light pouring in are defined by motes of dust dancing in the air. A fast track in on the jar of hair jelly sitting on the shelf under the mirror is shown, followed by an extreme close shot of his nostrils dilating as we hear him sniff. They are both intently munching cornflakes, staring at something offscreen. Ed is sitting in the living room, bottle-feeding Nathan Jr., surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets used by the house guests. Gale puts his spoon down and picks up a cigarette which has been smoking in the ashtray next to him, with a bead of milk dribbling down his chin. He takes a contemplative puff, studying Ed through a mouthful of cornflakes. Gale blows out smoke and picks up his spoon to start back in on his cornflakes. Hi is walking in, yawning, holding the cornflakes box arrested in mid-air, looking at Ed, who is motioning to Gale and Evelle with her eyes. Gale and Evelle are looking dumbly from Ed to Hi, more relaxed now, to Ed, looking pleadingly at Hi. Feeling the look, he goes back to his cornflakes. Gale leans back to blow smoke at the ceiling. Hi, with Ed standing by, is just opening the door to a young couple. Glen is a short, stocky blond man in his early thirties, wearing Bermuda shorts, while DOT is wearing slacks, heels, and a scarf over her hair. From behind, Glen gives her an energetic THWOK on the ass. Dot spins and smacks Glen across the face with her purse through clenched teeth, and he reels under the blow. Dot shrieks again, but this time muffles it with her own hand, tiptoeing into the trailer, hand to her mouth. Glen, rubbing his cheek, seems angry at himself. At the top of the stoop, Glen turns out to the yard, where a scad of children, ranging in age from two to seven, are crawling over Hi's car. One is beating on it with a large stick, another sits on the hood pulling back one of the windshield wipers, etc. As Ed and Dot enter, Ed beams as they go to the crib. Dot puts her hand to her forehead, reacting to the baby as if she is about to faint, hides her face in her hands and looks away as if blinded, then sneaks a look around her hands.",
    "109": "The crowd yells for Forrest as he runs across the field with the defending team chasing him, continuing along the field until he runs into the end zone, prompting the crowd to cheer. Forrest stops in the end zone upon hearing the crowd and is met by band members rushing toward him with their hands up, signaling him to stop and stay in the end zone while a group of defending players falls over each other nearby. Forrest looks on as the crowd cheers wildly. President Kennedy holds an autographed football with the All-American Team, including Forrest in suits, standing behind him. The All-American players mingle around the food table, where Forrest steps up to see a large spread of food and soda, including numerous bottles of Dr. Pepper. He takes a bottle of Dr. Pepper from the buffet, a servant opens it for him, and Forrest begins to guzzle it, eventually setting down an empty bottle next to many others, holding his stomach, and burping. In black and white footage, President Kennedy shakes hands with the All-American football players, including Forrest, who steps up after another player and shakes the President's hand before President Kennedy turns and smiles. Forrest urinates in the bathroom, lowers the lid and flushes, then washes his hands and notices an autographed photo of Marilyn Monroe and a photo of John with his brother Bobby. Archival footage shows President Kennedy rising in a convertible and smiling, followed by Robert Kennedy at a podium receiving applause. Forrest, sitting on a bench, shakes his head as students in caps and gowns receive their diplomas, and upon his name being called, he steps up to accept his diploma with the dean shaking his hand vigorously. Looking out into the crowd, Forrest sees Mrs. Gump, who is crying, and later, they have their picture taken in front of a large statue. A military recruiter spots Forrest, steps up to him, and Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest as the recruiter slaps Forrest on the shoulder and hands him military literature. Forrest then steps onto the army bus amidst pouring rain as the bus driver yells at him. He is about to sit on the first available seat, but the recruit sitting there refuses him, leading him to try the next seat, where the second recruit slides over to block him, causing Forrest to step forward looking similar to how he did on his first school bus ride years ago.",
    "106": "Jenny puts her hand on Forrest's hand, and Forrest nods as he remembers while continuing to talk to the black woman, who looks up from her magazine. Jenny and Forrest walk, but a dirt clod hits Forrest in the back of the head, causing Jenny to look as Forrest rubs his head. Three young boys get off their bikes and pick up more rocks, and Forrest is hit in the eye with another dirt clod, causing him to fall backward onto the ground as the boys glare at him. Jenny helps Forrest back up as Boy #1 and Boy #2 throw more dirt clods at him, with another one hitting him in the arm. Forrest tries to run along the road, but his braces make it impossible, so he hobbles along as Jenny yells after him. Boy #1 and Boy #2 turn back toward the bikes, and the boys ride after Forrest, who continues to hobble along the dirt road while Jenny stands and watches. Forrest looks over his shoulder as the three boys race on their bikes, and he begins to run faster with his braces on as they chase him. Blood drips from a cut on his head, but he continues running despite the boys on the bikes gaining on him. Forrest hobbles along and then begins to gain speed, running from the chasing boys. The boys pedal faster as they gain on Forrest, who looks over his shoulder in fear and tries to run even faster to get away. Suddenly, his braces shatter, sending steel and plastic flying into the air. Surprised, Forrest runs and looks down at his legs as he continues to run faster, with the metal braces and straps flying off his legs. Forrest runs free of his braces and begins to pick up speed, while the chasing boys ride over the remains of his braces. The black woman continues to read her magazine, and Forrest smiles as he remembers. He is already at the far end of the road, clear of the chasing boys who stop and watch in disbelief as Forrest sprints away from them. Forrest runs down a driveway toward Jenny's small house, knocks on Jenny's door, looks around the field to the left, notices Jenny, and runs toward her. He reaches Jenny, and she grabs his hand and runs into the field. Jenny's dad, drunk, steps out onto the porch and shouts, then steps out toward the field, running through it with a liquor bottle in his hand while searching for Jenny. Jenny and Forrest run into a cornfield as Jenny's dad tries to chase her, and Jenny drops to her knees, pulling Forrest down with her.",
    "529": "They look at each other, reacting, as the film cuts back to Hannah's kitchen. Norma's face can be seen in the porthole window on the other side of the pantry's swinging door. She looks around the kitchen, then opens the door and steps inside. Holly stands nearby, working in the pantry area. Holly chuckles. Norma steps back out of the kitchen, the door swinging shut behind her. Holly looks at the door, sipping her wine, as the movie cuts back to Hannah's living room. A chubby, friendly uncle sits on a sofa, one child on his lap and several others gathered cross-legged around him on the floor. They lean on the coffee table, which is covered with glasses and a bowl of chips. Other guests mingle in the background; one couple enters the living room, smiling at the scene on the sofa. Mavis crosses the well-lit foyer in the background and opens the door to more guests. The uncle pours more beer from his bottle into the kids' outstretched glasses. They cry indistinctly with excitement. Laughing, he turns to the little girl sitting on his lap; he clinks his bottle against the bottle she is holding, which is almost as big as she is. The uncle and the children happily drink their beer as the movie cuts to a wall with subtly patterned wallpaper in Hannah's bedroom. Her face moves on to the screen. Hannah walks towards Elliot; he's in the bathroom standing over the sink. Elliot walks from behind the partially closed door to an offscreen medicine cabinet. Elliot turns back to the sink, once again obscured by the partially closed door. He dries his hands as Hannah, standing behind him, continues to talk. He closes the door, briefly obscuring Hannah and himself from view. The camera moves behind the closed door, into the bathroom. He opens the medicine cabinet and puts the aspirin bottle back. Elliot slams the medicine cabinet shut. He leaves. Hannah watches him go, reacting. She is stunned. Piano music is still heard very softly in the background as Hannah, hugging herself, walks slowly down the hallway into the living room. She briefly looks around, lost in thought. She sits down heavily, tiredly, on the arm of the couch as the movie cuts to several framed photographs on the mantel. The camera, however, moves closer and closer to a photograph showing Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three sisters, smiling into the camera. The film shows the bedroom night table, holding a small lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses. Elliot's pajama-clad arm moves into view. He turns off the lamp; the room is now pitch-black. Elliot turns the lamp back on, then turns to Hannah; she is lying on her side of the bed, partially in shadow.",

Holden stares at Alyssa, flabbergasted, while the crowd around them is shocked, focusing not on the fight on the ice, but the fight in their midst. Alyssa fumes and storms away, with Holden chasing after her, observed by a Bystander. Alyssa marches quickly, pulling on her coat, and Holden catches up to her but pulls back. She stares at him, hurt and pissed, while Holden's eyes are downcast, as she waits for a response. Holden skulks off, and Alyssa stares after him before starting to kick and punch a car beside her, finally slumping to the ground, crying. Meanwhile, Holden sits on the couch, alone in the dark, when Banky enters and sits beside him, opening his arms. Later, Holden sits alone at a booth and looks up to see Jay and Silent Bob standing above him; the pair slide into the booth. Holden pulls an envelope out of his jacket and tosses it to Jay, as Silent Bob thumbs through the comic while Jay looks over his shoulder, beginning to roll a joint. A waitress joins them, and Holden rubs his eyes as the waitress returns with the order, staring wide-eyed and offended at Jay. There's silence as Holden's head snaps forward, staring wide-eyed at Silent Bob, shocked, while Jay and Holden look at him. Silent Bob busts a move with his hands, then backhands him, as Jay raises his fist as if to strike, and Silent Bob lights a cigarette before Jay and Silent Bob exit. Holden remains in the booth, thinking. Later, he sits in the park that he and Alyssa walked through, staring at Alyssa's yearbook picture, and then an idea hits him. He jumps up, dashes out of the park, grabs a chair from the side of the room, where Banky and Alyssa sit on the couch, and paces in front of them. Alyssa's face drops as she subtly shakes her head, and the room is silent. Alyssa lights a cigarette, her head dropping, while Holden leans back into the couch with a huge sigh. Banky stares forward, wide-eyed, then shrugs. Holden smiles at his friend, then looks at Alyssa and moves to her side of the couch. Alyssa looks at him sadly, as shocked Banky lets out a sigh of relief. Holden reacts, and a tear rolls down Alyssa's cheek. She looks at him sadly and touches his face, then releases him and slaps him, before storming away, stopping briefly to look Banky up and down, and walks out of the studio. The door closes behind her as Banky and Holden stand there, silently, and a copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.",
    "113": "Neff walks in past the night watchman without answering and heads towards the elevator. The night watchman looks after Neff, relocks the door, and follows him to the elevator. Neff enters the elevator appearing pale and haggard with pain but maintains a deadpan expression as the night watchman joins him. The night watchman pulls the lever, the doors close, and the elevator rises. The door opens to reveal a small dark reception room with a pair of frosted glass doors labeled: PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE, with a little light beyond the glass doors. Neff straightens up and walks heavily out of the elevator, crosses the reception room to the doors, and pushes them open. These lead to a balcony that runs all the way around, overlooking the eleventh floor below, which is filled with desks, typewriters, filing cabinets, and business machines. Neff enters the area from the reception room while the twelfth floor remains dark and some light shines up from the eleventh floor where two colored women are cleaning the offices — one is dry-mopping the floor, the other moving chairs back into position. Neff moves away from the railing with a faint smile on his face and walks past two or three offices towards a glass door labeled with the number twenty-seven and the names: HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. Neff opens the door to reveal three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand against the wall with a rack of records underneath, and telephones on all three desks. Neff enters, switches on the desk lamp, and his head goes far back as his eyes close with cold sweat showing on his face. After staying like this for a moment, exhausted, his eyes open slowly and look down at his left shoulder. His good hand flips the overcoat back, unbuttons his jacket, loosens his tie and shirt, which proves to be quite an effort. He rests for a second, breathing hard with his eyes closed, then fingers a pack of cigarettes in his shirt pocket, pulls it out, and notices there is blood on it. He wheels himself back to the desk, dumps the loose cigarettes out of the packet, some blood-stained and a few clean. He takes a clean one, puts it between his lips, gropes for a match, lights the cigarette, takes a deep drag, and lets smoke out through his nose. Neff then pulls himself toward the dictaphone again while still in the swivel chair, reaches it, lifts the horn off the bracket causing the dictaphone to make a low buzzing sound. He presses the button switch on the horn, the sound stops, and the record revolves on the cylinder as he begins to speak. He then interrupts the dictation and lays down the horn on the desk.",
    "1225": "In the motel room, Ben looks in a mirror as he carefully shaves off his heavy stubble with a wet razor and then stops to study himself solemnly. Ben pulls up at Emily's and gets out of the car with a gift-wrapped parcel, then reconsiders, puts it back in the car, and walks towards the house, where Emily opens the door. The nurse comes out, and Ben, wearing his customary gray suit and shirt and tie, enters Emily's bedroom carrying the gift. One of the walls is covered in photos, some of Emily at different ages, and Ben studies them. He moves slowly over to the window with a fine net curtain over it and watches as Emily carries the casserole from the oven to a candlelit table, where the flame of a tea light glows in the darkness. Ben puts down the box and catches sight of himself in a full-length mirror. He comes out of the bedroom wearing a polo shirt and jeans and stands at the opened French windows. Emily is sitting at the table as Ben looks down at his outfit. Emily nods and smiles, waves her hand motioning for him to come outside, and, looking slightly awkward, he goes to the table and looks about at the lit candles everywhere. Emily nods and smiles at him, and Ben scratches his eyebrow shyly. Emily stretches out her upturned palm and gestures for Ben to sit at the table, then studies him seriously and nods encouragingly. Ben eagerly picks up his fork, tries a mouthful, stifles a slight grimace, and looks sincere as she smiles triumphantly. They're still at the table as Emily frowns listening to Ben humming and shakes her head, then goes to a record player. With her back to Ben, she falters slightly, takes a deep breath, puts a record on the turntable, and sings along, offering Ben her hand. Ben, sitting forward in his seat with his hands clasped, looks lost in sad thought until Emily slides her slender hand between his, pulling him to his feet, and he smiles. They dance close together, Emily's left hand on Ben's right shoulder, his right hand on her back, their free hands clasped as they move slowly, almost dancing on the spot, their eyes locked in an intense gaze, their faces close, and he nods. Emily walks behind Ben with her hands on his shoulders as he leads her into the workshop and switches on the light, then goes to the Beast as Emily opens her eyes, and Ben turns to face her while she scans the workshop, trying to spot the surprise.",
    "776": "Kate and Gordon shield their eyes as Jackson eyes the blast in the RV's mirror; a blinding flash fills the sky, followed by a vast wave of energy that flattens the remaining trees and sends Charlie flying backward. A tower of fire and thick black smoke fills the air as Kate hugs Noah by her side. Charlie clambers back to his feet as fireballs rain down behind him from the massive eruption, standing with his hands up wide as a huge chunk crashes right into him while fireballs slam down on the park. Jackson drives the RV along the road through this carnage, swerving to avoid crashing rock and then straightening the vehicle before a fireball hits the back of the RV, leaving a flaming hole. On the runway, Noah peers out of the plane, and Kate stands looking anxious as molten rocks crash down on the research center with the flaming rocks hammering the area. A fissure splits the ground between the RV and the runway as Jackson accelerates, making the RV jump. The ground falls away as the RV lands narrowly between the widening canyon, and Jackson pulls up behind the plane. Kate rushes over as Jackson emerges, hurrying back to the plane with Lilly. The tarmac cracks as Jackson looks back into the RV and finds a London tube map before a big burning fissure breaks open, and the RV tips backward into it. Jackson falls along the center aisle and desperately grabs a handle as, at the plane's controls, Gordon looks over his shoulder and sets the plane moving. Fireballs hit the ground by the runway as a hand appears on the jagged edge of the fissure, followed by another hand clutching a map. Thick smoke fills the sky as Jackson sprints along the runway after the plane, with Kate grabbing and yanking him inside the plane. Fireballs trailing thick columns slam into the ground as the plane rises to the end of the runway, with flaming rocks arrowing through the sky as Gordon clears a hilltop and outruns a volcanic eruption. The cloud gains on the plane, passing the occupants in shadow, before the plane rockets from the swirling cloud and flies away from the fireballs. Noah gives a thumbs up as Kate turns to Jackson, who catches his breath and opens up the map, revealing a big map of China while everyone stares at him dubiously. Gordon looks around from the pilot seat as Adrian hurries into Anheuser's office, following him into the corridor buzzing with activity. The famous arms-outstretched statue of Christ the Redeemer breaks apart and crumbles over the streets of Rio as Anheuser and Adrian enter the darkened chapel. Anheuser looks surprised, turns around, and walks out of the chapel while two agents close the doors, leaving Adrian and Wilson in the gloom.",
    "916": "Dillinger swaps looks with Gilbert, then shoves through a revolving door. Outside, he finds only a wealthy couple and a uniformed doorman. The gang leader glances around the sidewalk with a frown, then faces the doorman. Dillinger frowns. Now, a hood ornament of an archer gleams on Purvis' Pierce Arrow. In an FBI field office, a chubby agent shows a jacket. Purvis paces, then addresses his assembled task force. He faces a secretary. Purvis gazes out a window at a neighboring high rise, then faces his men. One agent briefly drops his gaze. Now in a telephone exchange with Baum, he plays a 78 record. Night time. Dillinger strides past a bright city park. Later, he marches through a crowded arch vaulted lobby. He finds Billie behind a hatcheck counter. She notices Dillinger as a male guest holds out his coat to her. Dillinger smacks the back of the bystander's head. As the man doubles over, the crime boss flips open the counter's pass-through and steps into Billie's work area. Yanking the man's wrist over the counter, Dillinger snatches his claim ticket. Billie stares as he finds the man's coat. The exotic beauty drops her gaze, and Dillinger throws the coat at its owner. He gets Billie's coat. He holds her coat open. Billie eyes it, then looks to a staring co-worker. With a coy smirk, she steps out from behind the counter and slips into her coat. Now, in an apartment, a hand drops a rabbit's foot key chain by a tabletop sculpture of two racing greyhounds. Dillinger leads Billie down a hall into a luxurious living room. As she takes in the space, he sets a chair near a sofa and looks to her. Billie joins him, slipping off her coat. Dillinger sets a simple cardboard box on the coffee table. Billie complies and looks around with a faint smile. Behind her, Red appears in his undershirt and leans through an open-air interior window. He gets a couple of glasses from a counter, then saunters off with two women. Dillinger sits facing Billie and lays his hand on the large box. The exotic beauty eyes it coolly. Dillinger allows a subdued smile, then shifts boyishly in his seat. Billie removes the lid, finding forest green tissue paper over the contents. Folding back the layers, she finds a camel-haired coat with a thick fur collar. Billie lifts the present from its box, staring at it. She swallows, then raises her tender gaze to meet Dillinger's. Her full lips curl into a smile. The crime boss grins. They gaze into each other's eyes. Later, on a bed, they smother each other with kisses. Silhouetted against a window, Billie leans over the reclined man, her bobbed hair tickling his brow.",
    "458": "He pulls out a deadly looking dagger, with a sharp point and a triangular shaped blade, and sprints on and Inigo, closing the gap, closer, closer, and he's down the stairs and heading into a dining hall and Count Rugen throws the dagger. Inigo tries like hell to get out of the way, but no, and it sticks deep into his stomach, and he hurtles back helplessly against the wall of the room, his eyes glazed, blood coming from his wound. Count Rugen looks across the room at Inigo, and Inigo sinks. Meanwhile, Buttercup shuts the door of the Honeymoon Suite, crosses quietly to the far wall where she sits at a table, opens a jeweled box, and takes out a very deadly looking dagger. She seems very much at peace as she touches the knife to her bosom and Buttercup whirls as we see Westley lying on the bed. Yellin's sword is beside him. His voice sounds just fine, but he does not move. Buttercup leaps to the bed, covering him with kisses. Westley is helpless, and she lets go, thumping his head against the headboard. Count Rugen looks very much surprised as Inigo, struggling feebly, pulls the dagger from his stomach, holding the wound with his left hand. Rugen pushes off from the table, sword in hand, moving in to kill Inigo. Inigo watches the Count approach, and the Count flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, and there's not much Inigo can do, just kind of vaguely parry the thrust with the six-fingered sword and Count Rugen's blade sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. The Count steps back, going for the heart again, and as this blow comes, Inigo tries to use the wall for support in forcing himself to his feet, and it's not a roaring success of an attempt, but he does at least make some progress, and again he manages to parry the thrust, as this time Rugen's sword runs through his right arm. Again, Inigo doesn't seem to mind, doesn't even feel it. Count Rugen steps back for just a moment, watching as Inigo continues to inch his way to his feet and then, just before the Count is about to strike again, Inigo manages a little flick of his own and Rugen hadn't expected it, and he jumps back, makes a little involuntary cry of surprise. Inigo slowly pushes away from the wall, and Count Rugen suddenly goes into a fierce attack, striking with great power and precision for he is a master swordsman, and he forces Inigo easily back, driving him easily into the wall. But he does not penetrate Inigo's defense. None of the Count's blows get home. As the Count steps back a moment.",
    "1080": "Over the sound of Adolf Hitler addressing a rally, grainy black and white footage shows him with his arm extended at an angle of 10 degrees from his shoulder, giving the Nazi salute as he reviews troops. A Nazi motorcade approaches a curved metal bridge, and a skull and crossbones on a black flag flutters in the breeze. A man is dragged across the street, while others, identifying labels on their backs, are hounded along by Nazi officers. Jews are shot into a ditch, and women, cowering, are pushed from their homes. One woman falls to the ground and is dragged to her feet. Old men in cloth caps with bags on their shoulders, and women carrying cases, are herded from their village. Black-uniformed SS officers kick a man on the ground. A helmeted German shoots a man in the back, while an officer coolly pulls a revolver from an inside pocket, raises it, and a young man falls lifelessly to the ground; the officer then pockets his gun and resumes his conversation. An army photographer is filming the event. Small children are hauled up into trucks, and families are separated. The bony-cheeked SS officer puffs on a cigarette as a truckload of people trundles past. The departing truck, escorted by Nazi outriders, is observed by two men hiding behind a tree, one in his 30s, the other in his early 20s. Near them, they see men from the village being led into a wood by black-shirts and their dogs. The two watchers run from the scene, passing a body lying face-down in a marshy pond. They run past and vault over a farm gate, where a man lies slumped against the farm fence. The younger man, Asael, drops his head and breathes heavily, helplessly looking up at his older brother, Zus. Carrying a small axe, the tall, dark-haired, unshaven Zus creeps across the farmhouse, opens a low door, steps inside, crouches down, and pulls back two planks from the floor. A small boy with blackened face and hands peers up at his two older brothers. Wary, the boy takes Zus's hand and steps up out of the hole in the floor. Zus pats the boy's blackened face, and moments later, Asael drapes a cloth bag over Aron's shoulder. Zus puts down the saw he's carrying, noticing something in the doorway of the farmhouse. He removes a narrow ornamental case engraved with Hebrew writing, a mezuzah, from the right-hand side of the door frame, grabs the saw and a cloth bag, and hurries his little brother away past a flock of ducks. Zus holds his brother to his feet and leans him up against a tree, pats Asael's neck, and for a moment, rests his head against his brother's brow.",
    "203": "The owner of the house passes with some Christmas packages under his arm, bends down to examine the trunk of the tree, then straightens up and smells George's breath and backs away. The owner proceeds toward his house as George is completely bewildered. George puts his arm around Clarence, and they start off up the road to Martini's place, which is now almost unrecognizable. The cheerful Italian feeling is gone, and it is now more of a hard-drinking joint, a honky-tonk. The same bar is there, but the tables have no covers, and the people are lower down and tougher. George and Clarence come in and go up to the bar as two people leave the bar. Nick the bartender is behind the bar, and as he speaks, he leans over the counter, putting his left fist nearly in Clarence's eye, puzzling Clarence. Nick turns away to get the drinks while listening suspiciously to their conversation but stops pouring the drinks with the bottle poised in his hand. George glances up at Nick, who slams the bottle down on the counter. A small wreck of a man with weak, watery eyes, obviously a broken-down panhandler with his hat in hand, is Gower the druggist, who can hardly believe his eyes. Nick picks up a seltzer bottle and squirts Gower in the face with it as the crowd laughs brutally. Gower smiles weakly as the soda runs off his face, and George, horrified, leaps up and goes over to Gower. The bouncers throw Gower out the front door. George rushes back to the bar, and George and Clarence come flying through the door and land in the snow. Nick is at the cash register busily ringing the bell while George and Clarence lie in the snow with George having a strange, puzzled look on his face. They remain for a moment as they land, looking at each other, and George catches a glimpse of the front of the building with the neon sign over the door. George and Clarence get to their feet, and George points to the sign while looking at Clarence, who sort of hangs his head. George fixes him with a very interested look and, still looking at him, goes up to him and pokes his arm, and it's flesh. George rapidly searches his pockets for identification, but without success, and is completely befuddled as he feverishly continues to turn his pockets inside out and starts off. Clarence rises, and George strides off hurriedly as Clarence slowly follows him, glancing up toward Heaven as he goes. George looks at the changed character of the place in surprise, then starts up the street toward the main part of town, and as he goes, the camera moves with him, showing a town that has completely changed from a quiet, orderly small town to having the nature of a frontier village.",
    "1390": "The trio stops, fighting their tears as a quartet of bleak shadows files from the hut. One of the shadows, Dumbledore, raises his hand and points, directing the attention of the others away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore speaks briefly, unintelligible from this distance, then the crows shriek excitedly, causing the Executioner to separate from the others and disappear behind a low stand of trees. Sunlight kicks off the axe as it rises over the trees, hangs etched against the sky, and then drops from sight. A sickening chop fouls the breeze, and Ron and Harry stare toward the trees in numb disbelief while Hermione, face turned away, trembles. Slowly, Hermione's hand falls onto Ron's shoulder, and the camera falls with her, continuing down the length of Ron's arm to his hand, where a drop of blood hangs from his finger and drops like a tear. Ron stares at his hand, at the blood running down his finger, and his eyes shift to see Scabbers streaking away. As Ron pelts after Scabbers, Harry and Hermione give chase. Ron reaches the summit, disappears over the top, and Hermione and Harry follow. They reach the top of the ridge and stop as Ron nabs Scabbers, cradles him in his bloody palm, spins, and looks toward Harry. Harry's eyes shift to see an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog bounding toward him in the gathering gloom. Harry shields himself when the dog leaps clear over him and vanishes into the gap at the base of the tree, beginning to pull Ron through. Harry and Hermione make their way through the primitive passageway, ducking the roots that dangle overhead, until the tunnel abruptly ends. Confused, Harry and Hermione glance about, then peer up at a small opening. Harry reaches up, hoists himself through, pulls Hermione up, and looks about to see stains suspiciously similar to dried blood blotting the floorboards and shattered furniture strewn everywhere. The ceiling creaks as they dash to the stairs and come out, looking down at a wide, shiny stripe cutting through the dust-laden floor, as if something has been dragged, to the end of the hallway where a light seeps from a door. Harry looks down, follows the paw prints on the floor to a pair of filthy human feet, and then looks up slowly at the man standing in the shadows, with filthy, matted hair hanging to his shoulders and skin like a corpse, who studies Harry's face keenly. Harry draws his wand, eyes Black with his wand hand shaking violently, and the two regard each other with the moment taut with tension, then Lupin steps forward and embraces Black like a brother, leaving Harry and Ron staring, dumbfounded, at Lupin.",
    "1115": "Beside the lifeless head of his enemy, the basilisk, Harry touches Ginny's hand, and she is still clutching the diary. Harry grabs the diary and opens it, then raises the basilisk's Poison Fang and stabs the diary. Riddle recoils as a light pierces the hole in his chest, and blood spreads over the page. Harry stabs again, and Riddle puts a hand to his face as the powerful light surges out of his body and lifts him off his feet. Raising the fang again, Harry closes the diary and stabs with all his might into the black leather cover. In a flash of light, Riddle completely disintegrates, leaving behind only a few faint sparks floating in the air. Ginny suddenly wakes and, looking confused, she sits up and sees Harry, who is clutching his arm in pain. Dumbledore's Phoenix swoops down and settles beside Harry, looking sadly at his face. The handsome bird lowers its head, and its huge tears fall from its eyes onto Harry's arm. Ginny watches, her eyes wide with amazement, as the Phoenix weeps. Vapor rises from the wound, and the torn flesh begins to heal. Harry looks up at Fawkes. Later, Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny cling to each other as the powerful Phoenix carries them to safety and away from the Chamber of Secrets. In Dumbledore's study, Ron and Harry look at each other in amazement, and Ron leaves. Harry nods thoughtfully at the silver sword, takes it in both hands, and reads the inscription on the blade. The door flies open, and Lucius Malfoy strides in with Dobby at his heels. Lucius walks towards Dumbledore and glares at Harry, who glances at Dumbledore and holds up Tom Riddle's diary, prompting Dumbledore to smile as he turns to Lucius. Lucius kicks Dobby down the stairs, then hits him with a stick. Harry puts the sword down on the desk and looks at the black leather diary before catching up with Lucius in the corridor. He gives him the diary, and Lucius hands it to Dobby, leaning close to Harry and giving a sneer before turning away. Dobby still holds the diary and finds the sock between the pages. Harry pulls up his trouser leg and shows Lucius his bad ankle, then Lucius pulls a wand from his stick and advances on Harry. Dobby stands between them and with a fix of his hand, Lucius is hurtled backwards. The little elf folds his arms in triumph and then turns to walk away. Harry smiles. Later, everyone is gathered in the great hall, and he floats between the tables. Filch stands by the door, stroking his cat. Sitting at the Gryffindor table, Neville looks around as Hermione stands in the doorway smiling. Ron and Harry are thrilled to see her; grinning broadly, they get to their feet as she runs down the hall to join her friends.",
    "188": "Annie listens to the growling of the dog and turns to Lindsey in the living room. We see the shape's legs a few feet from the house, next to Lester's legs, kicking and struggling a few feet above the ground; off screen, the shape is strangling the dog in mid-air. Finally, the dog's legs stop moving and dangle lifelessly. Laurie and Tommy are sitting on the couch watching the Horror-thon on TV. Laurie holds out her hand, and Tommy takes it, and together they walk into the kitchen. Annie walks through the passageway to the laundry room, wearing a nylon robe and carrying her clothes to be washed. The wind blows the robe open as the door creaks open, and Annie walks into the dark laundry room. In the light from the main house, Annie sees the light switch. Almost immediately, the wind blows the door shut. Annie stands motionless for a moment, then begins looking for the light switch and turns toward the slightly open door. Behind the door, we see the outline of the shape standing there. The wind blows the door open a little wider, and she glances outside the door. She steps back inside and crosses to the washing machine, opens the top, and dumps her clothes inside. Suddenly, a big gust of wind comes through the opened window above her, and the door slams shut. Annie hurries to the door and tries to open it, but she is unsuccessful and tries to pull the door open. Meanwhile, Lindsey Wallace, 8 years old with a pretty face, watches the Horror Marathon at top volume on TV and lets the phone ring away. Annie turns and glances at the window above the washing machine, where we see the shape looking in, but then the shape is gone. She quickly crosses to the washing machine, climbs up on top of it, and starts out the window, but halfway through she gets stuck. Lindsey finally gets up and walks to the phone, her eyes pivoted on the TV. Lindsey pulls on Annie's legs, and she slides from the window onto the dryer. As Annie and Lindsey walk back into the house, the phone rings, and from the house, Annie hears the phone ring. Lindsey races across the room and picks it up, then sets down the receiver and walks out of the kitchen. Annie gives Lindsey a dirty look and picks it up. Suddenly, behind Annie, the shape walks through the hallway between the living room and the kitchen. Annie then walks into the living room.",
    "1083": "As Tuvia contemplates the cabin full of sick people, Lilka comes in, and his eyes search her face as she hands back the revolver. At the army camp, Viktor is looking at a chart, and Tuvia has come into the camp, causing Zus to look at Tuvia and turn away. Zus comes up, and later at night in the deserted town of Stakiewicze, Zus and Tuvia are sitting in a parked vehicle, where Tuvia is coughing and produces the ornate Mezuzah case. Zus snatches it from him and climbs out of the truck, signaling to Benzion and Krensky. Keeping their heads low, the three of them scurry across to one building and then sneak towards the police station building flying the Nazi flag. Tuvia's feverish eyes watch nervously from inside the vehicle as he starts at the sight of lights flashing amid the sound of gunfire and grips his own gun. Inside the police station, Krensky is shot dead, and Benzion fires back, killing two policemen. Tuvia trembles as Zus dives towards the next office and is shot at by the police chief, but not before gunning him to the ground. Zus runs into the office, flings open the cupboard of small medicine bottles, and scoops them up into a sack. Benzion vaults over the police counter, reaches for the transmitter, and smashes it with the butt end of his rifle, but a policeman bursts in and plants Benzion with bullets. Zus runs back into the front office and guns down the policeman, clutching the wound in his stomach, while Tuvia's face is full of foreboding as the vehicle hurtles out of the town. Wincing with pain, Zus produces the bundle of medicine bottles, and the truck's headlights pierce the bliss of the country road. Sometime later, Shimon officiates the burial, as in his cabin, Tuvia is fighting the fever. At mealtime, as people huddle in groups, Arkady is standing at the food table and glares at Asael. Both draw knives, but Arkady stares at Tuvia's drawn pale face and the black rings under his eyes and sheathes his knife, then saunters off, his lip curled, as Asael watches Tuvia withdraw and Lilka also looks anxious. Asael's eyes blaze with anger. At the army camp, Zus is sitting on his own as Lova, one of his group, kneels down by a basin of water, his face and hands covered in blood. Zus's eyes flicker in anger. In his tent, Viktor, bleary-eyed, is playing the accordion with Gramov sitting by him whistling. Viktor pours another glass of vodka, and Zus indicates Gramov, who doesn't appear to be paying attention, prompting Viktor to swipe him across the face. Gramov glances at this commanding officer and looks up at Zus, as Viktor dismisses the incident with a wave of his hand, and Zus leaves the tent.",
    "1238": "Grainy footage shows matches from the time, featuring rough tackles, as it is revealed that England failed to qualify for the World Cup, making the position of England's manager the most coveted job in the country, with only one obvious choice. In an empty Leeds United stadium, rain soaks the muddy pitch while photographers' flashes light up the boardroom windows. Burly, middle-aged Don Revie, flanked by members of the Leeds board, makes his way from the boardroom to a press conference with a nonchalant wave, as gaunt, grey-haired Manny Cussins, director of the board, sits uneasily before the press, bringing his hand to his mouth. On a gloomy day, a Ford Zodiac travels a moorland road, with two boys in the back staring through rain-soaked windows as the handsome driver, Brian Clough, sings along to the radio, driving past the Leeds United stadium. In the Yorkshire television studios, Brian smirks a wry, lopsided smile. Watching at home, a livid Don storms to the phone and dials. Back at the Elland Road stadium, a group of boys scamper after Brian's Zodiac while it swings into the car park below the Leeds United AFC sign, and a gaggle of reporters flocks around as craggy-faced Jimmy Gordon opens the driver's door, letting Brian and his sons out. Brian waves to his boys and up at the footballers on the training field, who scowl down at him through a chain-link fence, before turning back to the press. Brian struts into the boardroom, shakes Cussins' hand, and sits at the end of the long board table, his broad grin setting hard as the board glare at him, but he still beams his toothy grin. Six years earlier, at the draw, Brian picks up the phone outside Derby County's rundown stadium, the baseball ground, where elderly groundskeepers eye the letters missing from the club's sign. Brian points at the visitor's entrance and marches in through the tatty door, dashing down corridors past smoking cleaners. On the pitch, the groundsman marks white lines as grubby kids gaze over the training ground from streets of terraced houses. Brian stands beside tubby Peter Taylor, watching the team play, and volleys a goal. In his trademark red track suit, Brian sweeps the dingy corridors by the Derby dressing rooms, under flickering strip lights, polishing the brass plaque on the visitors' door and stepping back to admire the now-untarnished sign. In the shower room, Brian stands in the chest-high plunge bath, scrubbing the white tiles with a coarse brush before laying an orange on each of the neatly folded towels on the benches, then placing a heavy, glass ashtray beside each of the towels and strolling out. Brian gravely eyes himself as he smooths his hair in his office mirror.",
    "170": "The strip leads to Mesas Casino, where Chili sits across the desk from Dick Allen, surrounded by lots of jewelry and a giant neon cowgirl visible out the window behind him. He returns a snapshot to Chili, then turns and stares at a minivan. Chili gives the driver a look, gets out of the bus, and stands in the rain, with his seat getting wet and nowhere to go. All the lights are out, except for the blue glow of a television from one of the downstairs rooms. Inside, a shape stirs and we see Harry Zimm, a balding and overweight movie producer. He sits up, grunts, gets out of bed, and looks out of the window. He starts looking around the room for his clothes, listening to a familiar voice at the door. We see it is a nice place as Harry crosses the entry hall to a doorway, with the flickering light of the television emitting from inside the room. Harry moves into the glow of a big Sony television, the rest of the room dark. On the screen, Dave is interviewing actor Martin Weir when suddenly the screen goes black and a desk lamp comes on, causing Harry to jump. Chili leans into the light and keeps his tone quiet and controlled. Harry presses a hand against his chest and then slides it down over his belly, taking his time to show he has it together now. He stares back, trying to figure out who Chili is. Chili nods, almost smiles. Harry lowers his hand, grabs the phone, and punches '0'. Chili leans forward, hangs up the phone with his index finger, and casually reaches for the receiver, then hangs it up. Harry sits down and starts to take another drink, looking at Chili, who shakes his head and keeps staring at Harry with a more thoughtful and curious expression. Chili nods and leans forward on the desk. Their conversation grows louder as Karen descends the stairs. Chili sits with Harry at a butcher block table, with a bottle of Dewars and a couple of glasses between them. He turns around and sees Karen standing in the doorway, her arms folded across her chest, wearing a Lakers T-shirt that comes down just past her crotch. Leo becomes really uncomfortable and motions to her for another drink, when a plane taxis past the window in the background as Leo's head hits the table, followed by a big fireball in the background. Fay reacts as the FAA guy points to a little green hat on one of the tables. She grabs it, clutches it to her chest, and pretends to faint.",
    "534": "The woman looks back at Ron; she gestures with disgust. Ron coughs. Gail walks around the chair. The camera shows she and Mickey talking to Ron through the reflection in the cluttered makeup mirror. Ron sighs. Mickey, as reflected in the mirror, starts to pace. Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and Mickey's former partner, is driving down a peaceful street lined with palm trees. He's wearing sunglasses and headphones. He clicks his fingers in time to the music only he hears on his Walkman. He's smiling contentedly while Mickey talks over the sun-filled scene. As Mickey finishes his ruminations, Hannah is seen walking towards her front door. She opens it, her back to the camera. Mickey stands there holding two boxed gifts. Hannah continues to nod patiently, patting Mickey on the back, as they make their way across the foyer into the den, where the twins are playing. Mickey wears his coat. Mickey hands a gift to each twin. The twins put down their gifts, one on the sofa, one on the coffee table, and hug their father. Mickey throws the football. There's a sound of breaking glass. Hannah and Mickey react. Mickey is walking up a West Side street, his hands in his coat pockets. Mickey pushes open the outside door of Dr. Abel's office, as the movie cuts to the doctor's consultation room. The doctor is framed in the doorway, looking through a file cabinet. While Mickey answers him offscreen, Dr. Abel turns and walks toward him. The camera follows the doctor's movements from the other side of the wall, obscuring him briefly. It moves across a dark examining-room wall to a second doorway, where Mickey sits on a stool, continuing to talk to the offscreen Dr. Abel. Dr. Abel walks back onscreen. Both he and Mickey are now seen through the second doorway. Dr. Abel sniffs and stands directly in front of the sitting Mickey. He stares down at him as Mickey talks. Dr. Abel chuckles. An uptempo big-band sound is heard as the movie cuts to Mickey's examination, beginning with a close-up of Dr. Abel using an otoscope to examine the ear of a nervous Mickey. The film shows the doctor's hands turning the dials on a sonometer. Mickey sits on a nearby high stool, large earphones on his head. He listens with such concentration that he squints his eyes. He holds up a finger in response to the sounds he hears in his headset. Finally, the film shows Dr. Abel hitting a large tuning fork with his finger. He puts the vibrating fork to Mickey's ear. Mickey, looking up at the offscreen doctor's face, nods. Dr. Abel walks from the examining room, through the consultation room, to a second examining room across the way.",
    "18": "She turns and faces the hallway, her sweetness dissolves in a flash, replaced by repulsion, and quickly she reverses herself, re-entering her apartment and closing the door behind her. Meanwhile, all his considerable talent and strength are focused on seducing a tiny dog into the elevator door he holds open, sniffing at a particular spot on the hall carpeting. Melvin lets the elevator door close and advances on the mutt, who ignores him; the dog lifts his leg just as Melvin lunges and picks him up with a decisive heft, causing dog urine to squirt on the hall wall. Sensing a kindred spirit, the dog starts to growl and bark, taking a snap at Melvin, but Melvin, much meaner and quicker, holds the dog's snout shut with his hand and reaches for the garbage chute door, stuffing the dog in the chute and letting go, just as another apartment door opens, emitting loud party sounds and Simon Nye, in his early 30s, bolts into the hall. Melvin is about to enter his apartment when he notices Simon at the far end of the hall, starts to walk back to his apartment door directly opposite Simon's, and sees his black friend. Then he notices the handyman, tongue in cheek, trying to suppress his amusement. Melvin barely reacts as we hear a loud knocking, and he bursts from his chair. As Simon hears Melvin through the door, he takes a step back, and Melvin throws open the door, looking demonic. Melvin walks back into the apartment, about to close the door when Simon has another burst of bravery, but Melvin enters his apartment and slams the door shut. Meanwhile, Frank smiles affectionately; Simon turns serious as Frank waits patiently and Melvin jerks his door back open. Frank immediately grabs Melvin by his shirt, jerking him forward, and Melvin is scared but appears impressed. On a crowded and dirty street, Melvin comes walking briskly, like an animal wanting to pass through danger without giving off the scent of mounting fear, placing his palms together and extending his arms to cut a path through people, pointedly avoiding stepping on cracks and keeping his eyes focused on the terrain. Elsewhere, Carol Connelly talks with another mother, a customer, about her son for the umpteenth time; the mother nods too sympathetically, but Carol interrupts, and they turn away as Melvin walks a few paces to the waitress station where waitresses Lisa and Carol are talking.",
    "734": "Grabbing onto a cable, Jack stands on the railing of the ship's prow and raises his arms over his head. With his arms spread, he tilts his head back and closes his eyes as the enormous ship surges across the ocean. Meanwhile, Ruth, Rose, and Cal lunch with several guests, including Molly Brown and a brown-haired man with a mustache. Ruth stiffens as Rose lights a cigarette in a holder, inhales, and then blows the smoke in her mother's direction. Cal snatches the cigarette and stubs it out, while Rose smiles at him and then stands and leaves the table. Elsewhere, a brunette girl stands on a railing as her father grips her from behind, and Jack sits a few feet away sketching them with a stick of charcoal while crewmen walk dogs on leashes. The brown-haired Irishman extends his hand to Jack, who gazes across the ship. Rose steps to a railing on an upper deck behind Tommy, who turns and glances at her then grins at Jack. Jack stares up at Rose as she glances in his direction, looks away, and then peeks towards him from the corner of her eyes. Fabrizio waves his hand in front of Jack's face, and Cal steps up behind Rose and grabs her arm. They exchange words, and Rose strides off with Cal rolling his eyes and trailing after her. Wearing a ruby-colored evening gown, Rose shoves past other passengers as she runs down a deck, opens a gate, and dashes down the lower deck leading to the rear of the ship. Meanwhile, Jack lies on a bench smoking a cigarette and gazes up at the starry sky until he sits up as Rose runs past. With tears streaming down her face, Rose runs onto the poop deck at the rear of the ship, glances over her shoulder, and gazes down at the churning water. She places her hands on the railing, climbs onto its first wrung, and, holding onto a flag pole, swings her feet over the railing one at a time, lowering herself onto the gun wheel. Gripping the railing for support, Rose turns to face the water as the wind whips her curly, auburn hair around her face. She leans forward over the ocean, while Jack creeps up behind her, takes a last puff on his cigarette, and tosses it off the ship. Placing his hands into his pockets, he turns to Rose, removes his coat, unlaces his boots and pulls them off, and as Rose stares down at the water, she studies him. He takes off his vest, reaches out his hand, and Rose grabs it, turning around on a narrow ledge and staring into Jack's eyes. He smiles, and Rose steps on the hem of her dress and slips.",
    "1267": "Harry glances back the way they came, with Dumbledore a little way beyond him, facing away. Harry rises as Dumbledore spins around, smiles, raises his eyebrows, nods, and then backs away. The old man turns around again and vanishes into the whiteness. In the forest, Voldemort lies on the ground, pushing Bellatrix aside to see Harry lying motionless. Narcissa Malfoy strides towards the body as Bellatrix stares. Narcissa glances back, leans down, and checks Harry's pulse. Wide-eyed, she looks down and nods imperceptibly, remaining crouched for a moment as Hagrid watches keenly. Narcissa rises, turning to face Voldemort with a solemn expression. A lone figure staggers over rubble in the courtyard; it's Neville, who bends down to pick up the Sorting Hat, dusts it off, holds it upside down, and looks into it as reflection plays on his face. He looks up to see a slow procession of people in the distance and heads the procession as it trudges towards the school. Voldemort moves aside a giant's body, which falls from the bridge, and a large army of Death Eaters troops across. Neville, still clutching the Sorting Hat, slithers at Voldemort's side into the courtyard. Arthur pulls Ginny back as Ron and Hermione stand horrified and open-mouthed. Voldemort turns to his Death Eaters, and Lucius calls out, drawing all eyes to his son, Draco. Lucius stretches out his hand, purses his lips, and Draco sets off towards his parents as McGonagall and the students watch grim-faced. Draco joins his parents, and Narcissa puts her arm around him, leading him into the crowd of Death Eaters. Neville shuffles forward as Voldemort's face twitches and he flexes the bony fingers of his left hand. Neville glares at Seamus, his hand on his heart, and stares defiantly at Voldemort. As he draws the sword from the Sorting Hat, Harry leaps from Hagrid's arms; his spell bounces off Nagini, and he runs for cover. Voldemort uses his wand to shoot fire at Harry, prompting several Death Eaters to make their escape as the students run into the school and Shacklebolt deflects the attackers. A flash hits the Sword of Gryffindor, catapulting Neville backward, and the Malfoys make their escape back across the bridge. Harry is alone, clutching his wand, walking backward and turning sharply. Hearing movement, he spins, fires, and hits a door frame, with three bodies lying on the ground. He runs as Voldemort apparates at the main staircase. Harry hides behind a wall, clutching a Basilisk fang, and shows himself as Voldemort climbs the main staircase. They fend off each other's energy blasts like a sword fight. Voldemort, with Nagini behind him, moves towards Harry, disappears, and apparates above him on the stairs as they lock energy blasts. Harry is forced backward as Nagini slithers up the stairs towards him.",
    "1066": "Birds take flight over a land which has turned green as the dusty plains have been replaced by rivers, lakes and islands, and waterfalls tumble down the rocks of the previously dry canyon. Sarah and Drover are bathing in a pool in each other's arms when Nullah jumps in, and they all dine happily outside in the evening twilight. Later, Sarah and Drover stand together in each other's arms, kissing, and Sarah watches him ride away while a herd of horses thunders past the house, driven by Drover. He sprints up to Sarah, waiting on the porch, and launches himself into her arms, and they kiss passionately. Fletcher knocks Carney into a swamp with his rifle, and a crocodile attacks the cattle king. At sunset, Drover, in the saddle, leans down and kisses Sarah. The house and neat, colorful gardens of Faraway Downs are bathed in sunshine as a figure in crocodile boots ties cotton around a fly. Fletcher is sitting with a boot up on the dining table, and Sarah stares at him in dismay. He sidles up and whispers to her, then points to a display of spears before she frowns as he leaves. Bandy comes slowly back into the room, and Sarah turns anxiously to her. Nullah stands up on top of a water tower as Sarah watches his arrival from the verandah. He stops his horse, checks his herd, then gallops off, and she wakes up in bed, frowns, and then looks across at Drover lying next to her and smiles, running a hand down his bearded cheek and then down his hairy, muscular chest. A wild horse is ridden, bucking, around a training ring, and he frowns at the boy while Nullah cowers behind a gate. Drover watches him go, followed by his dog, and he frowns thoughtfully while trimming his beard. Sarah is sitting in the bath, looking upset as she listens sullenly, frowing as he stands expressionlessly on the verandah while birds fly over a rocky hill and Drover works a brumby in the paddock. He whirls a lariat as the wild horse canters around him and launches the rope, which slips around the horse's neck; the brumby bucks wildly, trying to get away. Bandy heats a brand in the fire and passes it to Sarah, who brands a steer being held down, while Nullah, minding the horses, looks up and sees his grandfather, exchanging hand gestures with him. In the paddock, Drover works the wild horse, hauling on the rope to prevent it from bucking, while Nullah looks at Sarah, then into her eyes, and across at his grandfather. The brumby trots towards Drover, who holds out his hand to it, while holding on to Nullah, Sarah looks around, and the plain behind her is empty.",
    "225": "He climbs in. The car belches and pops and toodles off down the road. Delmar staggers to his feet and stumbles over to the carcass of the frog, weeping. His arms, stretched high over his head, are tied to a tree limb. His interrogator wields a bullwhip. Another lash, another scream. A third man walks into the torchlight, a hound drooling at his heels. He is Cooley, the sheriff with mirrored sunglasses whom we remember from previous barn confrontations. The two men acknowledge by backing away from Pete and then the accelerating pitter-patter of arriving rain. Cooley looks up. He looks back down at Pete. He shrugs, looks off. Looking up, into black: a rope is tossed up - it recedes out of the torchlight into black night - and then drops back down into the light, a noose bouncing at its end. The two henchmen fit the noose over Pete's neck. Delmar doggedly shakes his head. We distantly hear picks ringing and male chanting. Hollow-eyed, Everett tries to convince himself as much as Delmar. His voice trails away as he looks out at the road. They are passing a line of chained men in prison stripes and duck-billed caps wielding pickaxes and shovels at the side of the road. As he stares at the line of men Everett tries to pick up his thread. The prisoners look like phantoms in the heat and dust. Everett is haunted. The last man in line swings his pick and, as he grows smaller, looks up. Everett stares. Lone and lorn, he returns Everett's slack-jawed stare until heat ripples and the truck's dusty wake dissolve him away. Everett blinks. Everett shakes his head as if to clear it. The truck rattles on. On a bunting-covered stage, a pencil-necked man with round rimless glasses addresses a crowd of rustics. The pencil-neck is identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, Friend of the Little Man', and, in life as in the pictures, he shakes a broom over his head. A midget in overalls stands next to him. The midget waves his little midget broom in time with Stoke's waves. He beams amid cheers and then, as three girls in gingham frocks run out to join him. The oldest girl is about ten. Everett stomps toward the stage, fighting his way through the crowd. Puzzled, Delmar follows. A man in a straw boater joins them. Everett sniffs and, catching a scent, squints. With this he takes a wild swing which Waldrip easily eludes. Waldrip adapts a Marquess of Queensbury stance and prances about, delivering stinging punches to the nose of a stunned and outclassed Everett. Its glass doors swing open and Everett is hurled out and bellyflops into the dust of the street.",
    "178": "Laurie stands by the telephone, shrugs, turns away from the window, and walks back to Tommy and Lindsey sitting on the couch. Meanwhile, in another room, illuminated only by candlelight, sheets move slowly up and down on a bed. Empty beer cans form a trail from the door to the bed as lovemaking occurs between Bob and Lynda, suddenly stopping as Bob grabs Lynda, pushing her down on the bed. The camera moves back from the bed as they continue, through the bedroom doorway, where The Shape stands in the darkness watching them. Bob and Lynda finally climax, and Bob rolls off Lynda. She, with messy hair and a sense of frustration, lights a cigarette, handing it to Bob, then lights one for herself while he leaves. Lynda smiles to herself and leans back onto the pillows. Bob leaves and comes through the swinging doors, opening the refrigerator to take out two beers. He gathers the food and beers into his arms, looks around the kitchen, finds a can of peanuts in another cupboard, and steps to the door to look outside at the empty yard where just the wind blows the trees before he shuts the doors. Then, Bob freezes, staring at the two doors, walks to one and opens it, turns from it, steps to the other and opens it. Right behind the door, The Shape, wearing the rubber mask, steps out and grabs Bob around the neck with an instantaneous lunge. Bob attempts to jump away, but The Shape has a firm hold on his neck, causing Bob to cough and gag. The Shape then lifts Bob up off the floor; Bob's feet leave the ground as he makes a guttural sound with The Shape's hand tightening around his windpipe. Still holding him up with one hand, The Shape slams Bob against the wall, holding him several feet off the floor as Bob struggles to get free. The Shape lifts his other hand, which holds the butcher knife, and drives it deeply into Bob's chest with a slamming thud, embedding the other end of the knife into the wall. The Shape steps away, leaving Bob hanging there, impaled on the wall, eyes open in horror, dead. Unaware of what has happened, Lynda lounges in the bed, smoking another cigarette, and hears what she thinks is Bob entering the room, but doesn't look up. The Shape, disguised as a ghost, stands in the doorway, motionless. Lynda laughs at her own joke, then stops when she realizes the ghost doesn't move or respond, making her turn around and look again as the ghost just stands there.",
    "1279": "A truck rumbles down a desert highway towards the smoking chimneys of an industrial complex, and the driver fiddles with the radio, looks puzzled, then switches on his windscreen wipers as a cloud envelops the truck. Starting at the back, the truck is eaten to dust by the voracious mass which flies on, causing a road sign to disintegrate, chewed to nothing. Others start to panic as the cloud flows into the ops room while a huge array of men in vehicles has assembled nearby. Vast pressure strains the massive steel doors of the facility until they burst open and one is hurled high in the air. The soldiers let fly at the cloud with all the firepower at their disposal, but it rises inexorably down the hillside towards them, and men start to run as the cloud reaches them. The Defense Secretary stares at the officer, then lowers her eyes in resignation. Meanwhile, in a sparsely furnished room, Helen sits head bowed and then looks affectionately at Mike. She gathers up her belongings, including her phone, and checks her watch. In the woods near a high bridge, Jacob and Klaatu find an old ranger hut, force open the door, and Jacob tries the phone. Klaatu unplugs the receiver, touches his finger to the end of the cord, plugs it back in, and hands the phone to Jacob. The lad reaches up to dial on the wall-mounted phone as Klaatu looks around the room. A pickup drives down a forest road with Jacob and Klaatu sitting in the open back. Jacob looks earnestly at Klaatu, who considers him without emotion and then looks thoughtfully at Jacob. An iron gate is topped with ornate spikes as Jacob climbs over a low wall also topped with iron railings, followed by Klaatu. The alien follows the boy into a cemetery filled with rows of white headstones, and Klaatu looks down at the inscriptions. Jacob kicks leaves away from one of the graves and dusts off the headstone with his glove, then looks pleadingly at Klaatu, who studies him and walks away. Jacob kneels down dejectedly in front of his father's grave, and as he kneels crying, Helen rushes up to him, kneels down, puts her arms around him, and hugs him tightly. They put their arms around each other and hold each other tightly as Klaatu watches them intently. Remaining expressionless, Klaatu walks towards them, and as he approaches, wind blows the leaves. Mike arrives in his SUV, and Helen looks imploringly at him, her eyes filled with tears. The swarm darkens the sky behind Klaatu and approaches a sports stadium, which crumbles to dust as the cloud engulfs it. The mass, now a vast swirling gray sea, is heading for New York. The Secretary raises a hand to her mouth, stifling her emotion.",
    "1274": "Hermione and Ron go downstairs as Luna follows Harry. In the courtyard, she faces the school where massive stone statues of warriors wielding huge weapons land on the paved terrace by the main entrance. The stone warriors march down steps to the courtyard, as Professor Flitwick strides across the cobbled courtyard and points his wand in the air, joined by Professor Slughorn and Molly. Students stand beside them, staring up into the sky as flashes of light flow from the wands, causing clouds to join together. A Dementor flies past and is repelled by the ever-increasing mass that extends to cover the school and the grounds, forming a protective shield. Inside, Harry continues making his way up a spiral staircase against the tide of students, with Luna catching up to him. He stops and turns, spotting something outside a window. Moving towards it, he gazes out at the glowing protective shields as they slowly descend, and side by side, they stare at the shield. Flitwick is outside, watching the shield ascend, as Luna and Harry stand framed between torches. His shadow cast against a wall, Harry continues along a dark corridor, the only light coming from a tall window on his right, as he nears a stone doorway. Harry sees a ghostly dark-haired woman in a gray dress hovering by a window, who turns to him, becomes a ball of light, and passes through Harry. The ghostly woman stops with a somber and anxious face. Outside, the night is almost pitch black, with the lights of Hogwarts glowing dimly in the distance, as an amassed army of Death Eaters stands on a rocky outcrop looking down at the school. They part as Voldemort, followed by Bellatrix, strides through the army to the edge of the cliff and turns to glare at Pius Thicknesse, who backs away. The Death Eaters aim their wands in the air and loose a volley of bolts of light, raining down like shooting stars on the protective shield. Harry looks across at the ghostly Helena as she moves away. He runs around a walkway and leaps onto a low wall. Having confronted Harry, she recedes, floating away from him, out into the walkway. Harry follows her as she stands with her back to him, turns stiffly to face him, studies his careworn face, then moves closer before floating away. Helena transforms into a ball of light and speeds away. Harry races down the spiral staircase where Kingsley Shacklebolt is with Remus Lupin and student Dean Thomas. Shacklebolt stares up as the Death Eaters' bolts strike them, while the Weasley twins, George and Fred, stare up at the sky. Hermione stands behind Ron at a door decorated with six large metal snakes.",
    "182": "The old woman stares at her suspiciously for a moment, then turns from the door and walks away. Her hand reaches out and touches it. Tommy turns and runs upstairs crying. Laurie moves from the door to the telephone. She picks it up, dials a number, and waits. She puts down the phone and stands very still. Slowly, Laurie moves around the couch. Slowly, Laurie sinks down to her knees by the couch. Her hand brushes against the knitting needles protruding from her tote bag. She reacts to the feel of the knitting needles and pulls one out. She begins crying softly, her eyes wide with fear. Suddenly, the shape leaps up from behind the couch! He springs at her, plunging the butcher knife. The blade of the butcher knife thumps into the couch. Laurie suddenly jumps backward, raising her arm instinctively. Instinctively, Laurie raises the knitting needle and drives it home, right into the shape's neck! The shape springs backward, clawing at the needle, rolling his head back and forth. Then suddenly he freezes, hands outstretched, motionless, and falls into a heap on the floor. Laurie sits there. The shape doesn't move. She stares at it. The camera moves with Loomis as he moves along the street. Suddenly two headlights hit him, and a police car swerves to a stop next to him. Standing there is the shape, the butcher knife raised. Both children scream. Laurie shoves them into the bathroom and pulls the door shut, leaving herself outside in the bedroom. There is a click as the bathroom door is locked. Laurie leaps away from the door and circles around the bed. The shape keeps coming. The shape moves for her, slowly now, but relentless, the knife glistening. Laurie dashes to a clothes closet and ducks inside. Laurie pulls the sliding doors closed and crawls back into the small, dark interior of the closet. Suddenly the doors begin to buckle as the shape pounds on them. The door buckles inward as the shape smashes against it. She reaches up and grabs a wire hanger from the top of the closet. She twists the top of the hanger, unwinding the wire. The door breaks in. The shape steps inside, pushing aside the clothes. She unhooks the hanger and bends it out straight. The shape leans in, peering down at Laurie in the corner, raising the knife. Holding the hanger with both hands, she thrusts it forward with all her might. The wire hanger flashes into the shape's right eye. He leaps back in pain, dropping the butcher knife, grabbing his eye with both hands. She grasps the butcher knife with both hands and jabs it upward. The butcher knife plunges into the shape's mid-section, right down to the hilt.",
    "1210": "Rambo rips out his throat and throws him to the floor, and Sarah looks up. Soldiers fight over women at the dance as Rambo leads Sarah from the officer's hut and across the compound. The dance hut is engulfed in red smoke, and boozy soldiers stagger from it, grinning; one taps another on the shoulders. Rambo leads Sarah under the wooden bridge over the stream, and they hide there briefly, as drunken troopers stagger over it. From below, Sarah and Rambo watch their solid army boots go by. A woman is dragged from the smoky dance hut. Rambo leads Sarah up the stream as the party is all over, and the last of the soldiers stagger away from the dance hut. Sarah and Rambo climb up the banks of the stream and into the road, and she falls in the mud. They're spotted by patrolling guards who raise their rifles, and Rambo leaps onto Sarah to shield her. School Boy shoots one of them and then aims again, and the second guard's head explodes and he flies through a nearby fence to join his fallen comrade. Rambo and Sarah leave as School Boy closes a night-vision sight on his weapon. The rain has stopped, and the moon appears from behind a bank of cloud. The commander emerges from his hut in his vest, pushing the small boy before him. He stands on his veranda, watching the boy trudge away across the compound before turning and heading back inside, closing the hut door behind him. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run through the forest and pause breathlessly at a tree trunk. Rambo turns to School Boy, and they exchange stares before they move away. A golden sun peaks over the tops of trees, and the camp is a hive of activity. Tracker dogs sniff around clothing for scents, and they're lifted into the backs of trucks. The commander strides angrily out of his hut, exchanges words with a junior before stalking across the compound to the soldier's hut, and goes inside to stare wide-eyed in horror at the sight of the soldier's corpse on the hut floor, with blood either wet or caked about the man's dead neck or pooling on the floor. The commander takes a few short breaths and leaves again. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run past a wall of rock. The commander stands in the passenger seat of the truck with a mounted machine-gun and leads a small convoy out of the camp, followed by a pair of open-topped lorries packed with troopers. Lewis leads his party of mercenaries and rescued peasants through the forest, and some way behind him are Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy. On a dirt road, one of the lorries pulls up and a bunch of troopers dismount with weapons primed.",
    "167": "He holds her gaze as angrily as she holds his. As she starts to rise, he grabs her arm, but she pulls free. She says it derisively and it stings, but Gandhi is aware of Walker and he fights to hold his temper. Ba settles back defiantly. For a moment Gandhi stares at her, and she back at him, resentfully. He suddenly reaches down and grabs her arm, pulling her roughly to her feet. It is hushed but violent as he pulls her toward the rear door, opening it to push her out as she struggles against him. Gandhi stares at her breathlessly, his temper subsiding into a dazed remorse. He sinks numbly to a stool, sitting, holding his head in his hands. Ba studies him for a moment -- and she sighs, her temper and breathing subsiding too. She moves and kneels before him. A moment, then she soothes the top of his head -- like the mother-wife she is. Gandhi looks up at her, blankly, abjectly. And Gandhi grins weakly. Ba catches it and sends it back, warmer, less complicated by doubts. Gandhi sighs, putting his arms around her and she leans into him so that their heads are touching. Ba nods. Gandhi holds her back so that he can look at her. She looks at him evenly -- no smile, but the warmth still in her eyes. The theater is packed. The front rows near the stage are held by rich Muslim merchants, the back of the stalls with small traders, peddlers, artisans -- Muslim, Hindu, Parsee, Sikh. The gallery is bulging with indentured laborers -- largely Hindu. The mood is restless, belligerent. Gandhi moves forward and he holds up his hand for silence. Seated on the stage are Khan, Singh, three more leaders of the Indian community. Charlie Andrews and Herman Kallenbach sit at the very end of the line of chairs. Gandhi looks around the audience and we see the packed house from his point of view, ending with two plainclothes European policemen conspicuous in seats at the end of the front row. A uniformed policeman stands near them. A buzz, then applause -- loud and defiant. When it subsides, Gandhi looks down at the plainclothes policemen, fixing his gaze on them. And again the audience bursts into applause. The policemen just sit like stone -- confident, sure, immune to rhetoric. In the gallery, a rhythmic pounding signals the anger and protest and is taken up around the hall. The police stare imperturbably. Khan leans towards Singh, nodding to Gandhi. Singh smiles at the understatement. Gandhi holds up his hand, silencing the hall. Now a violent response -- a large, powerful merchant rises in the third row.",
    "944": "Holmes spots two pipers outside the church and gestures for them to play. Watson awakes with an appalled expression. Holmes starts pulling at a coat Watson is using as a blanket. Watson clings to it, so Holmes yanks it from his grasp. A couple of empty bottles fall out of the car as Watson struggles out of it. As Holmes tries to tidy him up, the sleeve of Watson's jacket rips off. Holmes tosses it into the car. Watson eyes him wearily, and Holmes nods. They clasp hands, and Holmes leads a shambling Watson towards the church. The guests are in their places as the bride makes her way up the aisle. Everyone gets to their feet, including Mrs. Hudson, who taps a slumbering Holmes on the shoulder. He comes to and rises to his feet. A spruced-up Watson is standing beside him. Holmes quickly adjusts Watson's tie and buttonhole, before Watson lifts the bride's veil. She smiles up at him and sees he's sporting a black eye and generally looks knocked about. She looks over at Holmes, who winks reassuringly. Watson places the ring on his new wife's finger, and they share a kiss. Holmes looks down thoughtfully. As Watson and his bride leave the church, they walk beneath the raised swords of several guardsmen. Standing alone by the latched gate of the churchyard, Holmes applauds. Holmes disappears through the gate and cranks his car's engine into life. Moriarty's bearded agent is leaning against the side of the car. The agent rolls a cigarette. The agent steps aside and Holmes pulls away in a cloud of smoke. Kings College, Cambridge. Puffing on his pipe, Holmes makes his way across a quadrangle and goes into a building. Holmes walks into a room where a gramophone is playing. Moriarty and another man, Matthew, are there. Moriarty looks round at him. As Moriarty sits at his desk and signs the book, Holmes walks behind him and looks at a blackboard covered in calculations. Moriarty looks up. Holmes spots a book by the blackboard. Holmes sees a dying plant nearby. Moriarty hands the signed asteroid book back to Holmes. They shake hands. Holmes steps away and looks at the signature. Moriarty gets up. A flashback to Irene. Irene's tea was poisoned. He shows Holmes her bloodstained handkerchief. Moriarty sits at a chessboard and picks up the black queen. Holmes looks down thoughtfully. He picks up Irene's handkerchief from the chessboard. Holmes glares at him then makes to go. Moriarty stares after Holmes then turns his attention back to the chessboard. He moves the black queen.

The camera stays focused on the doorway to this room as the doctor and Mickey talk offscreen. Dr. Abel briefly passes by the doorway. Looking preoccupied, Dr. Abel walks back into the consultation room, holding Mickey's open file. He strides over to his desk, revealing a frightened Mickey, sitting in a chair opposite it. Still standing, the doctor leans over the desk, his back to the camera, and makes a few notes in the file. Dr. Abel chuckles as he closes Mickey's file and straightens up. The camera looks past his back and shoulders to the anxious Mickey. Dr. Abel lays his pen across Mickey's closed file. He walks around his desk and sits on its edge close to Mickey. Mickey stands in a telephone booth on a corner near Dr. Abel's office; he talks on the phone. It is raining. A man and a woman holding an umbrella pass by; traffic moves across a nearby intersection. The film cuts to Dr. Wilkes, on the telephone at his end. He is in his office; he leans back in his chair, dangling his stethoscope as he speaks. Behind him, a chest X-ray is mounted on a light panel. The movie cuts back and forth between Mickey in his phone booth asking questions and Dr. Wilkes in his office answering them. Gail, wearing her glasses, stands behind a crowded but well-ordered desk. Two assistants, a man and a woman, stand around her. The assistants walk off. As they leave, Gail calls out after them. The telephone starts to ring, Gail pauses, looking offscreen. She takes off her glasses and squints. The film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands. He walks over to Gail. He starts to pant, looking worriedly around the room. He continues to wring his hands as Gail stares at him, concerned. She sits down and picks up the phone. Gail hangs up the phone. He pants and begins to pace around the room. The camera follows him as he walks away from Gail. Mickey sighs. Mickey begins pacing around the room again. He wrings his hands and blows on them. An abstract painting on a wall fills the screen. Light laughter is heard, as well as the sophisticated music; offscreen brunch guests chatter indistinctly. Holly walks onto the screen in front of the painting. She holds an almost empty tray of hors d'oeuvres; she wears a uniform. One of the men, murmuring his thanks, takes a last shrimp puff as Holly passes. Holly finally makes her way into the cluttered loft kitchen. Her tray is empty.",
    "649": "Salim lowers Jamal by his legs over a window, where a family inside the carriage is sharing a huge meal of pickles, rice, vegetables, and chapati. A young boy in a turban spies Jamal as he reaches in through the window and steals a couple of chapatis. The boy nudges his father and points, prompting the father to grab Jamal through the window. Jamal grips onto the window frame for dear life, but the father violently tugs Jamal, causing him to lose his grip and fall from the train, pulling Salim with him. The two brothers tumble down a slope next to the passing train and eventually sit up, breathless. Jamal stares at the horizon, and as the dust clears, the majestic white marbled palace of the Taj Mahal is revealed in the distance. The boys walk through a set of ground gates, staring agog at the magnificent architecture. Jamal notices the hundreds of pairs of shoes left by visiting tourists, and he and Salim steal a pair of trainers each. A sign reads that guided tours visitors are requested to collect receipts. Jamal stands leaning against the doorway as throngs of tourists mill past into the Taj Mahal. A middle-aged couple approaches Jamal, and the man offers money to him, which Jamal pockets. Outside the Taj Mahal, Jamal takes Polaroid photographs of tourists as Salim steals the tourists' shoes while they pose for Jamal. The boys then sell the shoes from a store. At night, Jamal and Salim sit smoking a hookah pipe and drinking with friends around a campfire, and Salim wears fancy leather cowboy boots. By day, Jamal touts for tourists as a guide while Salim counts wads of cash. Jamal photographs an Asian tourist outside the Taj and shows her a picture of Princess Diana in the same spot, but security guards spot the boys and chase them off. Jamal guides the tourist couple to a riverside, and while they are there, Salim and his gang break into the tourist's Mercedes taxi. Meanwhile, Salim's gang steals the tires off the Mercedes just as Jamal brings the tourists back from the river. The Indian driver starts hitting and kicking Jamal, and the woman mouths the word \"money\" to her husband, who then takes out his wallet and hands Jamal a $100 bill. Jamal rubs his eye where the driver punched him, and at night, he kneels before a pool and bathes his black eye. He looks into the night in the direction from where the music is coming and walks through a forest toward an outdoor stage, where Salim, Jamal, and their gang of urchins scamper across scaffolding supporting rows of seats above. The audience is mesmerized by the performance and fails to notice the boys stealing handbags and purses from between people's legs, while Jamal is captivated by the singers on stage.",
    "719": "Rose watches the elevator ascend, then glances around as she wades through the water, and she glances up at a sign over a doorway. She walks down a short corridor and turns down a long hallway. In the office, Jack, still handcuffed to the pipe, climbs onto a desk as the water rises. Rose pauses at a staircase, then turns left and walks down another flooded corridor, littered with floating furniture. The hall lights flicker on and off. Jack turns toward the closed office door. Rose turns around and hurries to the office door. Rose steps into the office, kisses Jack, and searches through a cabinet filled with keys. Rose pulls out a desk drawer and turns to Jack. They exchange smiles while Rose searches in the drawer. Meanwhile, the bow of the ship sinks. Empty-handed, Rose glances around the office, pushes the desk chair out of her way as she walks to Jack, kisses him, and makes her way out of the office. Rose moves down the long, dim corridor in waist-deep water, climbs upstairs to the D deck, and runs down hallways. A mustached man runs toward Rose, then runs away. Rose gazes down the empty corridor, takes a few steps, and stops as the lights go out. Her chest heaves as she leans back against the wall. The lights turn back on, and Rose stands. A dark-haired steward rounds the corner, pulls her, and she punches him in the face. He stumbles back and touches his bloody nose, then hurries away. Rose leans back against the wall, blinks, then stares ahead. She steps forward, unwraps a fire hose, and uses it to break the glass on a case containing an axe. She grabs the axe and runs toward the E deck stairs. On the bridge, Smith leans over the railing and gazes down at the flooding bow and front well deck. Meanwhile, Rose descends the E deck stairs and stops above the water, which has risen above several steps. She steps down into the water, grabs an overhead frame, and ducks her head out into the hallway. She glances both ways down the flooded hallway, then steps back and hangs the axe on the frame. She takes off her long sweater and drops it, grabs the axe with one hand, and wades into the water. With her free hand, she grasps a long pipe running along the ceiling, propelling herself down the hallway. She holds the axe over her head and walks through the chest-deep water into the office. She holds out the axe. Jack stretches the chain connecting the handcuffs out on the water pipe. Rose lifts the axe, walks to the wooden cabinet, swings the axe, and strikes the cabinet door.",
    "1182": "Ron snickers and holds out his hand, but Harry does not shake it. Professor McGonagall returns and gives Malfoy a sharp, warning look before the oak doors swing open, leading the way into the magnificent great hall of Hogwarts School. The first-years march down the center of the room, watched curiously by the rest of the school sitting at long tables. Hermione looks up at the ceiling to see hundreds of lighted candles floating mid-air above their heads, below a moonlit sky. Professor McGonagall stops beside a patched and battered wizard's hat perched on a stool in front of the high table as Hermione tries to calm herself and sits. Professor McGonagall puts the sorting hat on her head, and the hat speaks. Delighted, Hermione runs to the Gryffindor table while Malfoy sits down. As the hat touches his head, a man with black hair is sitting next to Professor Quirrell, and Harry winces and touches his scar. Ron steps forward nervously, and the sorting hat is placed on his head, recognizing him at once. Ron sighs with relief, and Harry smiles. Professor Dumbledore leans forward with interest, and Hagrid holds his breath. Harry steps up onto the platform, sits on the stool, and the hat is placed on his head as the sorting hat regards him thoughtfully. Hagrid and the professors join in the applause, and the other Gryffindors welcome Harry as he joins Ron and Hermione. Harry looks up towards the high table, where Professor Dumbledore winks and raises his golden goblet in salute. A wonderful banquet appears magically on the long tables, and the delighted children fill their plates. Ron grabs a chicken drumstick in each hand and takes a bite from each one in turn, while Seamus introduces himself. Harry turns to Ron's brother, suddenly noticing a ghostly head appearing in the middle of the table as more ghostly figures float around the great hall, including a lady with ringlets, a plump man in a monk's habit, and a cavalier with a sword and a long, curling wig who swoop above the tables. Percy speaks to the ghost on the Gryffindor table, who then floats away, and Ron calls after him as he tilts his half-severed head and puts it back. Later, Percy leads them upstairs where, high above their heads, the staircases swing to different positions, and the images in the portraits are alive. A pretty flower girl curtsies and an old man looks up from his book as they walk along the corridor. Percy stops in front of a gilt-framed portrait of a large lady with ringlets wearing a pink silk dress, who looks at them inquiringly and beckons graciously. The portrait swings aside to reveal a cozy sitting room with a blazing fire, and in the boys' dormitory, uniforms are neatly folded on the chairs beside their four-poster beds.",
    "885": "A third man, Mr. Hurst, comes over as Darcy regards the building with an air of detachment. Inside, the dancing is well under way, with smiling men and women in pastel gowns holding hands and going round in a circle. An older man, Sir William Lucas, claps from the sidelines. Dressed in their empire-line dresses, Lizzie and Lydia are thoroughly enjoying themselves. With dainty steps, they set to their partners and do-si-do before re-forming the circle. In a two-line formation, before the chamber musicians, the ladies and gentlemen set to their respective partners, then in unison glide across the floor, back and forth, a blaze of color and feathers. Heralding the arrival of the Bingley party, an awestruck hush descends upon the room. The new arrivals look distinctly ill at ease before Sir William Lucas hurries over to greet them. As people take to the floor again, Lizzie joins Jane and Mary, who are standing with Sir William's daughter, Charlotte. The two girls go to join their mother, and the ladies curtsy. But, with a curt bow, Darcy is gone, much to Mrs. Bennet's annoyance. Jane glances at her mother, before returning her attention to Bingley. Later, she's dancing with him, holding hands and smiling warmly. Whilst the young couple are enjoying themselves, watching at the side, Darcy cannot hide his disdain. Darcy turns and spots Mrs. Bennet holding court over tea and cake, not bothering to hide her contempt for him. Then, moving on, he spots Kitty and Lydia, running wild through the hall. On the dark street below, local men are getting merry and mimicking the dancing going on inside. One man is so enthusiastic he trips and falls in a water trough. When Jane and Bingley's dance comes to an end, he leads her by the hand to present her to his sisters. Mrs. Bennet looks on, with an approving smile. Jane and Bingley dance again. Bingley wears a dark tailcoat with pale satin breeches. Jane's dress is a delicate creamy gold with puff sleeves. She wears long white evening gloves. Bingley, who has noble features and fair curly hair, is an accomplished dancer, moving through the steps with ease and grace. Darcy prowls through the hall, his face set in grim forbearance. Sir William goes to speak to him but then thinks better of it. Nearby, Lizzie is sitting with a rather serious Mary. With a nervous glance at his party, Bingley allows Jane to lead him to be introduced to Charlotte Lucas. Another dance begins. Sitting nearby, Lizzie hears him and bristles. Bingley heads off. Having heard everything, Lizzie looks at Darcy out the corner of her eye. Then, with a mischievous smile, she gets up and crosses the room in front of him.",
    "1306": "Joseph Dunne changes channels with a remote control, moving past the upside-down cartoons and talk shows, and stops on an upside-down picture of a crashed train. As his knees come forward and he flips over, he tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet while gazing at the television screen, which shows a live aerial view of a train wreck smoldering below, with two trains tangled like snakes. Joseph gets up and moves to a small table with a phone next to a notepad. We are in a physical therapy center where about a dozen people are on specialized weight machines, including an elderly woman seated on an exercise table, breathing slowly, while Audrey looks away. The ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad while her left hand keeps typing, never looking up. Rain falls in sheets in the stadium where David stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties onto the field. He is in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood, which nearly touches the ground, and the word 'security' on the back has almost faded away, barely revealing David's face. There is a football game in progress on the enormous field, where the players seem unusually small as David steps out into the rain and turns on the bench. The room is still as they both stand awkwardly for a moment and Audrey tries to mask her reaction to the oddness of the question. Elijah just sits staring at the dark television screen, his face tense and unyielding. Elijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper, and Elijah's eyes move from the television to his mother, seeing the emotion in her face. Neither says anything for a while as Elijah thinks it over and looks at his mother with disbelief. Elijah walks across the playground, very wary of the other children running about, toward the bench with the present on it, taking a seat and placing the package on his lap. It's flat, with edges bending down over his thin legs. He undoes the white bow, peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together, and unfolds the paper to reveal a single comic book in his lap. He feels the shadow of his mother as she takes a seat next to him, and he looks at her with intelligent, piercing eyes, then back down at his lap. He opens the first page to find two figures depicted on top of a building locked in a fierce battle, one of which is extremely muscular with a mask.",
    "1339": "The judge is too stunned to respond, and he goes over to Valjean and gently leads him out. Meanwhile, Fantine starts to spasm and sees something over Valjean's shoulder. Her eyes go glassy as she passes away. Valjean then hears the unforgettable voice of Javert behind him and stands to face him. Javert draws his sword and aims it at Valjean, who breaks a section of timber beam from the roof. They sing at the same time, duelling in song, and the men start to circle each other. Meanwhile, Cosette goes to put the broom away as Madame Thenardier imitates her singing. We see Cosette's frightened eyes peering out from a tiny gap in the wall as Eponine comes in from outside. Madame Thenardier sees that Cosette, far from going, is hiding behind the far wall and goes outside to open up the rather pathetic frost fair stall on the porch of the inn. The innkeeper's gang, posing as customers who have been loitering outside, come in, explaining to a fifth man who is a newer recruit a story from Monsieur Thenardier's past, and Madame Thenardier ushers him inside. She pretends to accidentally drop a comb from her hair, and the customer helpfully picks it up, allowing Madame Thenardier to pick his wallet from a back pocket as he stands up. Thenardier has thieved the pocket watch using his handshake as a distraction and fusses over them, all the while pissing into the very wine bottle he's using to serve the customer. He is going through the groom's trousers elsewhere, while Cosette has filled her buckets at the well in the wood and is now heading back, going slowly because the buckets are heavy. After a few steps, she pauses to rest the weight of the buckets and looks up, amazed to see Valjean. Thenardier turns to his wife as Valjean gives him money, and then Valjean gives more money. He leads Cosette to the door and lifts her into the waiting cab as Madame Thenardier takes the bunch of notes from her husband's hand and inspects them. Through the open door, Thenardier sees a man on horseback rattling up to the inn, where Javert strides in. Valjean's cab, moving fast, passes down the road into the city. Inside the cab, Valjean has one arm around Cosette to protect her from the jolting as he gazes at her slipping into a fitful sleep. Valjean and Cosette turn down a narrow street, no longer hurrying, and make their way down a darkened street. They begin running down narrow alleys, into small dark courtyards, not knowing which way to turn, until Valjean finds a section of tumble-down wall and climbs over.",
    "88": "They stare at him, followed by an awkward beat as Jerry enters through the kitchen door, wearing a parka and a red plaid Elmer Fudd hat and carries a bag of groceries, which he deposits on the kitchen counter. Jerry enters again, pulling off his plaid cap, while Wade Gustafson is mid-sixtyish, vigorous, with a full head of gray hair. A twisting perspective reveals an aerial shot of a two-lane highway, bordered by snowfields, carrying one moving car, which is driven by Carl Showalter. Grimsrud gives Carl a sour look, followed by a long beat as Gaear Grimsrud stares blankly at Carl. Jerry sits in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle just off the showroom floor, facing an irate customer and his wife. He rises and, as he leaves, the couple watches him go into a nearby cubicle. Jerry sits, staring at his lap. Carl Showalter and Gaear Grimsrud are in twin beds, having sex with two truck-stop hookers. A woman picks up the phone, holds it away, and calls before someone takes the phone. Jerry wanders through the service area, where cars are being worked on, and stops by an Indian in blue jeans who is looking at the underside of a car on a hydraulic lift with a cage light hanging off it. Carl is driving, while Grimsrud stares out front and smokes, gazing out the window. He is driving and on the phone. A morning-show host in an apron stands behind a counter on a kitchen set. Jean sets down her coffee cup and rises, and as the two men enter, a door at the far side slams shut. Jean, sobbing, frantically pushes at buttons on the princess phone, which pops out of her hands, jangles across the tile floor, smashes against the door, and bounces away, its cord ripped free. Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet and throws it open, glancing back as she steps up from the toilet seat to the tank. The groaning of the door ends as the wood around its knob splinters, and the knob itself falls out onto the floor. The door swings open and creaks, moving as one piece in its frame as Grimsrud and Carl enter. The room is empty, and the window is open. Carl strides to the window and hoists himself out. Grimsrud opens the medicine cabinet and delicately taps aside various bottles and tubes, seeking the proper unguent. He finds a salve but sets it down after noticing something in the mirror; the shower curtain is drawn around the tub. As he reaches for the curtain, it explodes outward, animated by thrashing limbs as Jean screams, tangled in the curtain, ripping it off its rings and stumbling out into the bedroom.",
    "1026": "Pete enters the room and finds Sadie with tears in her eyes and holds up both hands. Meanwhile, Debbie prepares for the party as Barb enters the kitchen. By the pool, Pete and his goateed friend watch Desi in a bikini as she swims with Charlotte, while Barb glances toward the pool and Debbie notices Desi. The guys look toward their wives and wave. Pete greets guests and accepts presents, then stands with Ronnie. Jason turns Debbie around and stares at Pete while Ronnie stares off; they quickly leave, with Jason moving next to Ronnie, exchanging awkward smiles as they notice Desi swimming. Debbie opens the door for her father, who furrows his brows, while Pete looks down at the box and smiles. In the buffet line, Barb's husband turns to Debbie's father, and Larry extends his hand as Desi and the girls approach. Larry hugs Desi, eyes Oliver, and Charlotte takes Oliver's hand, while Debbie gives them a look. Desi swims in slow motion underwater, Jason and Ronnie swim side-by-side, and they meet in the middle as Desi surfaces with the guys following her up, emerging beside each other. Jason gazes into her eyes as Desi smiles, turns, and swims away, and the guys glance at each other and quickly follow. Later, Larry stands with Oliver as he eats; Oliver winks and takes a bite. Jason and Ronnie sit with Desi, who sits back and smiles. At another table, Larry nods and eyes Pete and Debbie, who nod with her, with Desi, Ronnie, and Jason nearby. Ronnie glances between them, Debbie glares to Pete, and he stops and looks at all of them, while she turns to Oliver. Debbie and Pete roll their eyes, Oliver nods at Pete, and Barb looks down. Graham Parker then leads the guests in song, Pete smiles at his wife, and leans toward his electric guitar-shaped cake, as she tilts her head with a slight grin and Oliver catches her gaze. Larry's triplets attack the cake and lick the frosting tuning pegs. Debbie hides behind some bushes with a cigarette in her mouth, desperately flicking and shaking a lighter, when Sadie rounds the corner, catches her mom, and startles her, prompting Debbie to drop her cigarette and head to the house. Debbie faces Pete and raises her arms as Sadie gawks at her mom storming away. Pete hurls his half-eaten cupcake at the kitchen wall, then hurries past his daughters to march to Debbie. Oliver leaves past Debbie, she follows him out, and stares at him slack-jawed. Pete rides his bike across the front lawn, and Sadie watches him go while Debbie turns to see Pete zoom out of the driveway. He races down a suburban street wearing his helmet and yellow-tinted sunglasses.",
    "625": "Ray is still staring ahead, and then he lowers his eyes and frowns as Graham regards him closely. Ray bows his head and reflects, his guilty eyes reluctant to confront Graham's gaze. Slowly, he turns and takes a breath, his doleful eyes lingering on Graham, then starts the engine and sits back in his seat while Graham stares. Ray peers earnestly at Graham, whose eyes moisten a little as he fights with his emotions. With his lips curled and features crumpled, Ray nods sufferingly before dropping his gaze as Graham turns to face Ray's clapboard home. At the farmhouse, in the closet under the stairs, Merrill is still watching TV, his brow creased with worry and lips slightly apart. Merrill moves his chair right up to the television and watches the camcorder footage of his hysterical young children inside the house, who are gathered by French windows pointing to the backyard, where tables laden with party food lie abandoned. The camera focuses on tall bushes at the back of the yard before returning to the interior and following the children as they swarm to another window. Merrill watches in frustration as a boy looks out on a narrow passageway, and the camera focuses on the passage. A lanky, dark figure with a human appearance steps across the passage and out of view, prompting Merrill to recoil, cupping a hand to his face in shock as he backs away from the TV. The film is rewound, and Merrill sits back down in front of the TV, watching with his mouth gaping as the picture freezes on the creature, the image flickering slightly. Graham enters Ray's house, pausing outside the open kitchen door, and steps timidly into the room, where chairs lie turned on the floor and tables wedge against the door leading into the pantry. A shadow passes under the door as Graham treads hesitantly toward it, accompanied by a sound. Graham stares intently at the gap under the door, and the shadow stops moving. He eyes the door anxiously, swallows, nods to himself, closes his eyes, and mouths \"Patty Wagon\" self-charmingly. The shadow under the door remains still as Graham glances briefly away from the door incredulously. Then, with his head turned wearily to one side and tucked defensively back a little, Graham drops delicately to a kneeling position, bends down, and, pressing his face to the tiles, peers under the pantry door, finding nothing but shards of glass. Kneeling up again and sighing with relief, he spots some chopped vegetables sitting on a worktop and a large kitchen knife lying next to them, which he contemplates for a moment before reaching out and grabbing it.",
    "1239": "He smooths his tie and carefully takes two crystal glasses from his case as Peter looks on. Brian sets them down side-by-side, then unwraps a bottle of red wine. Blowing dust off, he reverentially positions the bottle to the right of the glasses, then turns the label to face Peter by the door. Jimmy ducks in. Brian pulls his suit jacket on as he and Peter follow Jimmy out of the wood-paneled office. They hurry out of a side door in the side of the rusty, corrugated iron stand and over to the entrance gate. A coach is stopped down the street of terraced houses. Brian smooths his coiffed, dark hair and straightens his tailored suit jacket as he stands with Peter and Jimmy in the entrance gateway. Down the street, kids flock around Don and his team as they step from the coach and stroll towards the ground in their smart suits, signing autographs. A press photographer snaps photos as the players approach. Brian steps forward to greet them. Don sweeps past to meet his entourage, leaving Brian standing to one side at the entrance. Still seething, Brian watches the teams run out. Brian eyes Don in the visitor's dugout. Peter yells beside a glowering Brian as the Leeds players surround the ref. The physio carries McFarland off, piggyback. Brian grimaces introspectively. Brian sneers at Don. The wine stands untouched. Brian gazes out at Don ushering his players onto their coach, patting their backs for the press. Brian nods ruefully. Brian jabs a finger at Peter. The Clough family sits at a dining table in a semi-detached house in the rolling Derbyshire countryside. Peter glances at his wife. Brian smirks. Barbara Clough gets up from the dining table and wanders into the hall to find it empty. Brian speeds away from Peter's house. Peter feeds Brian crisps as Brian drives. Brian swigs a can of lager. They pull up in a suburban street. Brian and Peter swap grins as thick-set Dave Mackay opens his front door. Dave regards them. Derby players hit a ball, then run up and down the stands. Sam Longson joins Brian on the terraces. Press shots in team kit. Dave on the training field. Grainy black and white match footage. Derby climbing the table. Brian and Jimmy applaud. Top of the table. Champagne in the dressing room. A party in the board room. Having emptied a bottle of champagne into the silver cup, Brian pours it into the players' glasses. Peter smokes a cigarillo as he embraces Brian. They dance together while their wives and the team look on. Dave rushes forward to turn up the sound on Don accepting a trophy on TV. The Leeds players in track suits on the training ground near the stadium.",
    "114": "The front door opens and Phyllis steps out. She closes the door and looks in the direction of the tracks. She opens the back door of the car and leans in. She pulls the rug off the corpse (which is not visible) and stands looking into the car, unable to take her eyes off what she sees, while at the same time her hands mechanically begin to fold the rug. The running steps grow louder and Neff comes into the shot breathing hard. He reaches her. Neff points back towards the tracks. He reaches into the car and begins to drag out the body by the armpits. Phyllis coolly reaches past him and takes the hat off the dead man's head. She turns to go. Phyllis releases the hand brake and puts the car in reverse. Neff is again busy unwrapping the tape from his leg. The car moves. The car, with the headlights out, backs up, swings around and moves off along the dirt road the way it came. They are talking to each other. Their lips are seen moving but what they say is not heard. They stop talking. Phyllis stares straight ahead. The sedan drives into the shot and stops without pulling over to the curb. The car door opens. Neff starts to get out. Neff turns back to her. Phyllis bends towards him and puts her arms around him. Phyllis kisses him. In the kiss he is passive. Neff going up. Telephone bell box and the door bell. The cards are still in position. Neff's hand takes them out. Neff comes from the bedroom, wearing the light grey suit he wore before the murder, only without a tie. He buttons his jacket, looks around the room, and opens the corridor door. Fifteen or twenty cars are parked now. Charlie, the attendant has washed Neff's car and is now polishing the glass and metal work. Charlie sees him. He straightens up. He walks up the ramp towards the garage entrance. Neff comes out at the top of the ramp and starts to walk down the street, not too fast. Camera precedes him. He walks about ten or fifteen yards. At first his steps sound hard and distinct on the sidewalk and echo in the deserted street. But slowly, as he goes on, they fade into utter silence. He walks a few feet without sound, then becomes aware of the silence. He stops rigidly and looks back. Camera stops with him. He stands like that for a moment, then turns toward the camera again. There is a look of horror on his face now. He walks on, camera ahead of him again. Still his steps make no sound.",
    "594": "Harry's hair is disheveled as he splashes water on his ashen face. Harry watches the sobbing Draco from the doorway as Draco draws his wand and casts a spell, to which Harry responds. Draco casts another spell, and they hide at each of the cubicles. Draco appears around the corner and ducks back, while Harry peeks out, his image reflected in a mirror. They crawl on the floor, peering underneath the cubicles, and Draco misses Harry. Harry stands up and aims his wand, causing Draco to stumble back and fall into the water accumulating on the floor from a burst pipe. With a book in one hand and his wand in the other, Harry slowly walks the length of the cubicles, rounds the corner, and sees Draco sprawled on his back. Shocked, Harry stumbles forward and sees blood oozing into the water, with bloodstains spreading over Draco's white shirt. Snape strides in, brushes past Harry, and stands over Draco, glaring at Harry, who avoids his gaze and leaves. Snape kneels, and the blood recedes as the bloodstains disappear. In the Gryffindor common room, the potions book lies on the table in front of Harry, while Ginny, Hermione, and Ron are silhouetted against the light from a lead-paned window. Ginny crosses to Harry and sits beside him, and Harry nods. Standing in front of the unicorn tapestry, Harry takes Ginny's outstretched hand and grips it firmly inside the cluttered room. As Ginny leads him forward, they are reflected in a mirror, and they wander through the Room of Requirement. A sound comes from the triangular gap of a cabinet covered with a heavy cloth, and Harry approaches. The ends of the cloth don't quite meet, and through the gap, Harry sees the door. A bird flies out and settles on a stone shelf while Harry gazes at Ginny. She walks toward him, stands close, and they exchange a long look. She glances at the book, takes it from his hand, and he continues looking at her. She backs away, and Harry closes his eyes, standing rooted to the spot with shallow breathing. He swallows hard but keeps his eyes shut until Ginny returns, steps close, and kisses him gently on the lips. He responds, smiles, then opens his eyes to find Ginny has disappeared. Harry walks slowly along a corridor lost in thought when Ron approaches, and Professor Slughorn stops in front of them before hurrying away. In the common room, Harry uncorks the vial of Liquid Luck, watched by Hermione and Ron, and empties its contents into his mouth. They look at him as he stares into the distance, and they get to their feet while Harry grins and turns to them. As he passes students, Hermione and Ron look confused. A greenhouse window is forced open, and Slughorn's head appears.",
    "316": "The prisoners begin screaming vicious taunts and catcalls at the fresh batch of new inmates as Evan tries to keep composed and walks toward his cell. Evan looks up to see one of the men leaning over the second tier, Karl, a huge muscular con with tattoos of swastikas and other Nazi symbols on his arm, blows a kiss at Evan and winks. Evan enters a dimly lit cell plastered with pictures of Jesus Christ and various Saints. Sitting on the bottom bunk is Carlos, a massive Hispanic convict covered with faded Indian ink jail tats of Christ in agony. Carlos stares at Evan disinterestedly as Evan makes up his bed on the top bunk. Carlos leaves the cell without another word. Evan sets his tray down at a table filled with Carlos and some other inmates. Carlos shrugs at Evan and offers him a roll. Her hair is now bottle-blonde. Four inches of Plexiglas separate the two and they talk on monitored phones. Andrea nods, holding up two comp books. They look at each other and Evan slowly lowers the phone. He hangs up, Andrea still pressing her phone to her ear. Evan walks closely behind Carlos through a corridor, clutching his journals. As he passes Karl, the Neo-Nazi, Karl reaches over and firmly grabs Evan's crotch. Evan stands there, stunned, unable to react when another Neo-Nazi, Rick, swats Evan's journals out of his hands and onto the floor. Life springs back into Evan as he rushes for the journals. He and Rick grab the journals at the same time, initiating a minor tug of war. Rick tears them away, Evan coming up with only a few torn pages. Evan sees the damage and goes mental. Evan holds a tattered journal entry in his hand and finishes up a conversation and then studies the page. We are back in Mrs. Boswell's first grade class where all of the children draw colorful pictures. As he heads over to them, Mrs. Boswell firmly grabs his shoulders and steers him back to his own desk. Evan, defeated, looks over at his blank piece of paper. He smiles mischievously and grabs some colored pencils. Soon enough, an image emerges: Evan holding a knife stands over a heap of several dead inmates, Karl and Rick. When done, he sneaks over to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where the two paper spindles sit. The metal needles reach up and skewer a number of paper notes and messages. She looks over in time to see Evan using all of his seven-year-old strength to whip his hands down toward the spindles. The moment before his palms reach them there's a brief instant where soundscapes collide and the world behind him vibrates.",
    "605": "Fending off Gryffindor players, they pass the Quaffle, until one hurls it towards the goal. Ron swoops to save the shot. His supporters are ecstatic. In the air, Ron repulses wave after wave of Slytherin attacks. Hermione shakes her head but still looks towards. Gryffindor goes on the attack. A Slytherin Beater whacks a Bludger towards an opponent but misses and is himself knocked from his broomstick. A shot on target for Gryffindor brings cheers from their supporters, and a renewed attack by Slytherin in a V formation. The Quaffle zooms towards the goal. Ron saves it. His right fist raised in triumph, Ron looks down at the chanting crowd. Hermione barely smiles. Perfectly balanced on his broomstick, Ron raises both hands in the air. In the Gryffindor common room, he stands on a table showered with red confetti. Harry shows her the unopened vial of Liquid Luck. He shakes his head. Lavender flings her arms around Ron's neck and kisses him passionately. Harry grins. Next to him, Hermione takes a deep breath. As the kiss continues, she turns abruptly and walks out. Harry sees her go and follows. He hears sobbing in a dark corridor. From the top of a spiral staircase, he sees Hermione sitting on the bottom step, weeping. He walks down the steps, his shadow cast against the wall. Charm birds fly all around Hermione. She looks up at Harry. He sits down beside her. Ron and Lavender run into the cloister. She tries to lead Ron away. Hermione stands, her face grim. The birds dive headlong to attack Ron. He runs. They splat against a wooden door in a drift of feathers. Ron looks at Hermione in alarm and walks away. She sinks down onto the step. Hermione leans her head on Harry's shoulder. Awkwardly, he puts his hand on her arm. The celebration continues without Ron and Lavender, who run together up a flight of stairs. Standing beside a tall window, they move closer and kiss again. Draco Malfoy stands alone, high up on the astronomy tower. He leans on the balustrade and looks out over the school. Snow falls gently on the spires and roofs of Hogwarts. The cloisters are decorated with greenery. A raven-haired girl smiles. Luna with a knee-length tiered dress of pale pink silk, with chiffon ruffles round the neckline, skirt, and sleeves. Harry escorts her. They walk past a window bay, where Draco sits alone, deep in thought. His face grim, Draco walks along the upstairs corridor and stops. He closes his eyes. In the cluttered room, he pulls the heavy cloth from the cabinet. He opens the cabinet and places an apple inside. He opens the cabinet. The apple has gone.",
    "171": "As Karen finds herself listening, despite herself, meanwhile, the guy's hot, runs the three hundred up to half a million. Chili starts to speak, but Harry cuts him off, then turns back to Chili. Chili looks at Karen, and she's staring at Chili again, patient. Karen looks at the two of them sitting there; Harry turns to him, and they both look at her. She just looks at him, turns, and walks out, as Chili watches her go. Harry nods, thinks a moment, then Chili looks at him. We tilt up this time to reveal a little kid, listening to a Walkman, as Harry looks at him. Harry points across the street to the Cafe Med where we see a red Ferrari convertible parked out the front, and we see Martin Weir and a woman with jet-black hair sitting at a table. They watch Martin and the girl a moment, and Harry pulls out, starts driving again. There are some of Karen, Harry with a much younger, blonde Karen. Chili stands looking over some of the old photographs as Harry goes through the mess on the desk. Harry hands a script to Chili, who examines the cover, the first time he's ever held a movie script and opens it to the middle. Chili looks out the window as we see a long black stretch limo pull up to the curb down on the street. Chili tosses the script on the desk, moves between a pair of fat red leather chairs, as Harry moves away from the window and is tugging the string to lower the blinds behind the desk. Ronnie singing, and the door opens as the Bear opens the door for Bo Catlett and Ronnie. Chili sits behind the desk, watching the two of them come into the office, as Catlett comes first. Ronnie sits down in the chair and hooks one leg over the arm, swings it up and down, his motor running on some chemical, while Harry waves them right into the two cracked red leather chairs facing the desk. Sitting down, he nods to Chili, who ignores him, Harry already forgetting his instructions. Chili can't believe it, he too stares at Chili, and Chili shakes his head, he can't believe he's hearing this. The limo guys nod to Chili and Chili nods back, trying to catch Harry's eye. Ronnie looks over, so does Bo Catlett for that matter. Catlett looks at Chili again, now it's between them. The guy studies Chili, thinks about whether or not to make a move, when Harry steps in, reaches over the desk, and picks up a script. Chili looks at Harry, wonders if there's a way to shut him up without punching him in the mouth.",
    "597": "Water appears in the basin, and Harry scoops desperately but the shell wouldn't fill. Harry turns and looks at the lake, then crumbles down over the rocks towards the water. Holding onto a rock for support, he reaches down with the shell, and Dumbledore's ball of light sinks under the surface, darkness. Harry wields his wand, and the tip of his wand glows. He clenches his teeth, grips the wand with the hand he's using as support, and leans forward to dip the shell into the lake, filling it to the brim. A bony hand shoots from the water and grabs his arm, and he wrestles free. The water seethes all around the island, and the light brightens, revealing naked emaciated corpses clambering out of the water towards him. He lashes out at them as Dumbledore feebly tries to reach his own wand. Scores of corpses swarm onto the tiny island and attack Harry, and he's dragged underwater. A corpse wraps its arms around Harry from behind, and he grapples with it as they sink deeper and deeper. Above the surface, Harry sees flames, balls of fire streak through the water, and the creature releases Harry, allowing him to surface inside a circle of fire. Dumbledore is on his feet, flourishing his wand around his head, whipping up the fire, and the corpse retreats from the flames. Harry comes back onto the island and helps Dumbledore back to the boat. The flames part, revealing a clear channel of water ahead. Meanwhile, Draco Malfoy lies in bed wide awake, then gets up. The lights in Borgin and Burke's shop go out as Bellatrix leads a group through the courtyard to the room at the rear. She opens the door of the embossed cabinet, while Filch stands guard on the school battlements. Draco marches unnoticed along a corridor as Professor McGonagall leans out of a stone archway, looking out anxiously at the menacing clouds, and Snape looks out into the storm. In the Room of Requirement, Draco pulls the heavy cloth from the cabinet, steps back, and watches as the door handle turns. The cabinet opens, black smoke filters out, and Draco walks quickly away. Bellatrix, Greyback, and two Death Eaters with metal masks emerge from the smoke, and Bellatrix smirks. At the astronomy tower, Harry walks away then stops, looking back at Dumbledore. Harry hides as someone passes on the stairs, and the figure climbs to the upper platform, pointing his wand at Dumbledore. Harry watches from below as Draco pulls back his sleeve to show the Death Eater mark on his arm, and Dumbledore's wand falls. Still hidden, Harry sees Bellatrix, Greyback, and the two Death Eaters race to the upper platform, where Bellatrix faces Dumbledore and Draco still has his wand raised. Snape is behind Harry and enters the upper platform.",
    "1314": "Santa pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way. The Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear. Santa pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne and takes a swig. With the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store. Downstairs, the last of the store employees file out the door past an old Security Guard. Eventually, Santa emerges, and the Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM. The guard exits the store, locks the door, and heads home. Suddenly, a teddy bear moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room. The alarm continues to count down -- 15. The teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators and scrambles for the door, crashing into everything in its path. Running past a clothing display, it rips the arm off a mannequin without breaking stride. It skids to a stop at the base of the alarm box, too short to reach the controls. Mission accomplished, the teddy bear rips off its head to reveal its true identity: Santa's Elf -- in civilian life known as Marcus Skidmore. He is covered in sweat and panting like an asthmatic. A hasp flips open, and Marcus swings the door wide to reveal a beer-guzzling Santa-in-the-off-season known as Willie T. Soke. Willie finishes the beer, crushes the can, and drops it to his feet next to eight more empties. Marcus sneers at him as he lumbers past. Marcus reaches into jewelry cases and removes a few particular items, drops them into a stock cart, then checks a typed list before moving on. Marcus pushes the cart through the store, gathering an odd array of items that range from furs to gowns to shoes to makeup. Marcus arrives outside a doorway and looks in to see Willie manning a large water drill and putting it to work on the store's vault. Marcus moves closer as Willie pulls back the drill on the track, places a screwdriver into the exposed lock assembly, and hits it with a sledgehammer. Suddenly, the door swings open, and bundled cash spills to the floor. Both men are impressed. Willie settles on the rear bench as Marcus gets into the passenger seat next to his Pilipino mail-order wife of several years, Lois, who is dressed in expensively ugly clothes and whose mouth is ever down-turned in pruney distaste. The van speeds away through the Christmas Eve night and disappears into the distance, like the down of a thistle. Finally, an alarm clock rings with a jolt, and Willie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm.",
    "602": "Professor McGonagall is in the corridor, and Harry and Ron stand by the wall, laughing. Harry leaves Ron and goes to McGonagall, who shakes her head. In the potions class, a hand shoots up as McGonagall steps towards the potions. Harry opens a cupboard door and puts the lid on as the girls near it step back. Draco shows interest while there are hand-written notes in the margins. Ron tries to cut a Sopophorous bean, but it rolls away. He tries again, and it shoots into the air as Seamus stabs at his. Slughorn catches one in midair, and even Hermione's having problems. Harry reads a note in his book, and it works as he drips juice into his cauldron. Frowning, Hermione refers to her book again, while Crabbe and Goyle have no success. Seamus's cauldron flares up, blackening his face, as Harry follows the hand-written notes. Green slime slithers from one girl's cauldron and plops onto the table, while Hermione looks more and more frustrated. Harry pours in a clear liquid, and Professor Slughorn drops a leaf into Harry's brewing pot, leading the applause for Harry. Draco and his Slytherin friends don't join in. In his study, Professor Dumbledore examines a book with a hole burnt in it, places a ring in the hole, and closes the book in a drawer. A cabinet of vials sits nearby, and he selects one. Harry gingerly takes the vial and goes to a pensive, a hovering shallow metal basin. He glances at the elderly professor, who nods, and Harry pours the contents of the vial into the basin. Dumbledore flicks his hand in the air, and the lights dim as Harry plunges his face into the basin. Wispy trails of black smoke flow towards its base, and Harry sees a street with a large building straight ahead. A figure carrying an umbrella marches towards the building, and a younger Dumbledore steps into the room where an 11-year-old boy stares at him. Dumbledore touches a wardrobe as shells and pebbles line the window edge at the postcard of a craggy coastline. Tom sits at a table, frowning and staring at Dumbledore. The wardrobe by the door bursts into flames, and Tom removes a metal box from the burning wardrobe, opening the box and taking out small toys. Dumbledore walks away from the sullen Tom, then stops. Swirling black smoke consumes the image of the boy, and Harry takes his face out of the pensive. He keeps staring into the basin, takes a few deep breaths, nods, and stares resolutely ahead. Death Eaters hurtle through the clouds towards Hogwarts and hit the invisible shield, retreating. Two birds in a cage hang in a shadowy corridor as Draco Malfoy walks past them towards a wall covered with a tapestry of a unicorn.",
    "1303": "Morgan's throat is closing, his face is filled with strain and panic, while Merrill stares at his brother's desperate face. Graham closes his eyes, talks to the darkness, and Merrill's eyes fill up with water as Graham's eyes close, then open as he leans in close to Morgan's ear, after which Graham's eyes close again. He starts crying and speaks to no one, nods without looking over as the beam points up at the basement ceiling above, and Graham stares at the conviction in his younger brother's expression. Graham looks at Morgan lying limp on the ground, turns to Merrill, and the two men stand under the single dangling light bulb. Graham quietly turns and looks at Morgan, moves across the room towards him, and Merrill watches as Graham kneels down and reaches to Morgan's side. Graham unclips the baby monitor from his son's belt, walks back to Merrill, makes eye contact with Merrill, and holds it out between them, then turns it on, resulting in electrical static. The basement door cracks open a few inches, Merrill opens it all the way, moves up the stairs by himself, reaches the top and looks around, turns back down to the faces at the bottom, and gives them the thumbs up. He carries a limp Morgan in his arms, and Merrill nods as he begins to search the piles of things that have fallen from the cabinets, while Graham gently lays Morgan on the sofa. Bo steps out of the closet and looks into the family room, and Graham glances down, then looks up quickly, touches her cheek, and she starts crying. Colleen presses her cheek on top of Graham's hand, rests on it, with her eyes distant while Graham's eyes are not on Merrill. Merrill turns and looks to Graham, follows his eye line to the baseball bat mounted above him, and reaches up to take the bat off its resting place as the creature starts to move. Merrill's hands tighten around the handle as he walks forward, stops, shifts his weight to his right leg while Morgan's face is obscured by gas, and the creature begins to turn and becomes more visible as its lines and colors don't match in position in the room. Merrill's left leg goes out, the creature gets hammered across the back with the baseball bat, Morgan is dropped, falling to the carpet of the family room in an unnatural crumpled pile, with his arms and legs flopping lifelessly to the carpet. The creature turns to face Merrill and all the creature sees is the blur of wood as Merrill swings like a lumberjack, resulting in a slam and the creature falling to the ground. Graham picks up his son's limp body in his arms as the creature moves to its feet.",
    "1341": "Eponine is revealed staring at Marius through the door. Eponine comes to a stop, looking wistfully after Marius, who is stopped as he exits the front door of the Gorbeau Tenement by a passing carriage. Once it passes, Marius sees two people in the street outside: one is an old gentleman, Valjean, and the other is a beautiful young girl, Cosette. The two are giving alms to beggars as they walk back from evening church service. Marius can't take his eyes off Cosette. As if drawn by Marius's gaze, Cosette looks up and meets his eyes. She too is amazed; he's looking at her as if he already knows her. A second carriage breaks their held gaze. Marius continues on down the street, and when he looks back, at that precise moment, Cosette looks at him again. Valjean instinctively puts his arm around her, guarding her jealously from this distant boy's gaze. Further down the street, in an alleyway, the Thenardiers, heavily disguised, are waiting for Valjean's approach with their gang of crooks—Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse. Thenardier approaches Valjean and lures him into the mouth of the alleyway where Madame Thenardier is sitting on the ground holding the crying infant. Cosette is a few steps behind, still entranced by the sight of Marius. As Valjean bends down to look at Madame Thenardier, she recognizes him. Thenardier pulls off his disguise, and Valjean recognizes him. Thenardier signals to his gang. The gang moves in on Valjean menacingly, and a door opens in the alleyway revealing the huge Brujon. Marius and Gavroche, drawn by the rumpus, watch as the gang spills out into the street, confronting Javert and his men. Javert sees a man with his arm protectively around a girl but does not recognize Valjean as Valjean has averted his face. Javert turns back on the Thenardier gang in the passage but finds Valjean and Cosette gone, which makes him furious. Thenardier listens and hears this with great interest. She turns back to find Marius gazing down the street. Joly goes over to Marius at the back, a faraway look on his face. They sit and burst into laughter, but Enjolras isn't smiling. Enjolras turns to his companions, and as the students sing, Eponine enters wanting to talk to Marius, who sees her. In a pretty room, the best room in this small summer house, Cosette paces in her bedroom. Her shutters are open, giving a view of a wild unkempt garden. Valjean knocks and opens her door, then closes her shutters. Valjean leaves and goes into his own bedroom, and Cosette follows. Valjean sits on his bed, his back to Cosette. A simple wooden shack at the back of the summer house, Valjean himself lives with spartan simplicity, having given the best room to Cosette.",
    "586": "He opens a freezer and finds a bottle of vodka, pours it down the sink, and lifts the bulging plastic trash bag out of the trash can, carrying it outside. He slides the doors of the shed open, revealing a two-seat Cessna plane in the small hangar, removes the blanket covering the windshield, and switches on the lights. He looks at a group of photos hanging above a workstation off to one side of the hangar, takes a picture of a young African American boy wedged in a frame, and kisses the photograph. He pulls out a bottle of liquor from a bowling bag and tosses it aside, holds a framed wedding photo of himself and his wife, and later that evening sits watching the news. Charlie stands at a table strewn with pictures of the crash as men in suits look on. The next morning, Whip walks through the lobby of a hotel, cane in hand, with the large eye patch gone and now stitches remain about his eye. He enters a dining area with a buffet to one side and approaches Charlie seated with a man wearing glasses. Hugh looks through a file, Whip looks at the piece of paper before him, narrows his eyes, rises to leave, and stops in the bar area. A photo of Whip appears on the TV behind the bar, he sits at the bar and moves a cocktail napkin back and forth, as he studies the glass of vodka. He picks it up and takes a drink, smacks his lips, picks up the glass again, and drains the contents. Later, he sets a case of Budweiser in the passenger seat, gets in the car, unscrews a gallon bottle of vodka, looks around, and chugs it. Groggy-eyed, Whip drives down a street, beer can in hand, passes a dead-end street, and stops. He watches as Nicole loads items in the back of a car, looks away, then back at Nicole as she runs back through a worn fence, and pulls up to the apartment entrance behind Nicole's car. He passes the car with Nicole's things, glances through a few enlarged photographs in a basket, takes a sip from his beer, and looks up, alert. Whip walks toward the apartment, pushes Fran to the floor, Nicole nods, Whip takes out some money, looks at her for a moment, then nods. Nicole sits in the passenger seat of Whip's car as he drives and drinks his beer, she bites her thumb, he offers Nicole a beer and she refuses, he lights a cigarette, and she fidgets as she smiles to herself and observes Whip as he drives.",
    "1334": "He kneels by her side as Eponine is dying and then dies in Marius's arms. Marius looks up at the others, his eyes full of tears, and holds out his note. The landlady climbs the stairs, followed by Gavroche. The door opens a crack to reveal a cautious Valjean, who looks up, deeply distressed, and points to Javert in a dark corner, his hands tied. Javert looks up and meets Valjean's eyes in a steady shared look. Suddenly Valjean spots a couple of snipers creeping over the roofs to gain an angle of attack on them; they are aiming at Enjolras. Swiftly, Valjean grabs a gun and shoots up at them, sending them scattering. Quickly, other students join in, and the snipers are driven back. There is a burst of gunfire from both ends of the street as a brief firefight ensues, but the snipers have disappeared. Enjolras turns to Valjean, while Javert hears this with grim satisfaction. Valjean uses the knife to cut Javert free and raises his gun, pointing it at Javert. Marius is manically working to raise the height of one of the smaller barricades. Grantaire drunkenly starts singing a drinking song, and it is taken up more seriously by Feuilly as bottles are passed around. Valjean is moving through the cafe when he hears Marius through a window and moves to the window. Marius sits beneath it, and Valjean listens to Marius's song, moved by it. Valjean paces, unable to sleep, inside the cafe, comes to a stop, and gazes on Marius as he sleeps through the window. Valjean is now kneeling next to the sleeping Marius. Crane up and up to see the little world of the barricaded street now surrounded by waiting soldiers and the streets around them packed with soldiers in their thousands, so many that we know the little band can never win. Many of the rest of the rebels are sleeping. Crane up and up until the barricade and the army that entraps it become a small pool of darkness in the center of the bright lights of Paris. The sun is still below the rooftops as Enjolras re-enters the barricade through the secret gate. Below him, the students are up and getting ready. There is silence and uncertainty, yet no one moves to go. The rays of the rising sun break through, lighting up Gavroche. Crack! A musket shot, and Gavroche falls face down onto the barricade. Enjolras gazes on his pitifully small group as the sun now appears above the rooftops of the city. In its wake comes a massive barrage of musket fire. Valjean moves among them, tending to the wounded, lifting down the dead, regardless of his own safety. And the big guns fire—BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! The bombardment hits the barricade, rocking it.",
    "1307": "The other is half human, half animal. Elijah glances at the business man standing next to him and then back to the sketch. The business man rubs his face and gazes at the sketch. Elijah starts to the back of the store, which is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books. Elijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns and starts back to the businessman, shaking his head strongly. Elijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man as he points at the sketch. Elijah turns and faces the customers for the first time; David Dunne stands with Joseph. Elijah just stands staring for the longest time and then walks closer to them. When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it. David nods while Elijah looks shaken, and Elijah gazes at David, then points at the framed comic sketches. David shakes his head and smiles out of frustration. Elijah watches David walk towards the front door, and through the window, he sees Joseph take David's hand as they cross the street. Elijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze. David sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands, while Joseph is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs. David slides out from under his son's legs; Joseph stirs but doesn't wake up. David moves to the darkness of the corner of the room, opens a closet door, and a naked hanging bulb goes on as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the light from the bulb doesn't fall on Joseph. There's just enough room to stand and look around as David stretches and feels on the top shelf. His hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt, which he unwraps to reveal a handgun. He stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf. He stretches even more, reaches farther back, and pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. David flips through the top clippings, which are all images and stories of David and football, then turns the pile over to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others; it's a newspaper headline. David puts the new headline next to the old one, and they look like a set, even the font is similar. David stares at the old headline and stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway.",
    "1261": "A car plows into the side of them. Carl lies unconscious in a hospital bed with grazes on his face. A pretty nurse dressed in blue takes his pulse while Peter and Rooney sit beside the bed, with Rooney having a snack and Peter holding a drink. The nurse walks off, and Rooney watches her go as Carl stirs and looks fearful. Terrence pulls back a curtain, and Carl goes while Peter looks at Terrence. Wearing a hospital gown, Terrence goes, and Rooney gets into the bed and shushes Peter. Carl heads out, runs to an elevator as Lee steps out, and still in his hospital gown, revs Lee's Ducati bike, puts a helmet on, pulls a wheelie, and whizzes off. Up on the back wheel, Carl crashes through a barrier and heads out of the hospital car park. He rides up next to a UPS van, and the driver looks out and sees the Ducati's front wheel waggling about in midair. The bike's front wheel drops down, and Carl speeds through town, weaving precariously through traffic and hopping onto a pavement as pedestrians run for cover. A car pulls out ahead, and Carl pulls on the brakes so hard the back wheel flips up as he slows down. The car passes, and Carl wheelies off and, back on two wheels, weaves through the traffic. He speeds along a dual carriageway, his spotted hospital gown flapping in the breeze, keeping his head low and his arms bent as he rides the Ducati, which is a cross between a trail bike and a road bike. His gown has two ties at the back above the waist, and the gown billows, revealing his bare backside. He rides up to the domed observatory, where Allison is doing a warm-up with her jogging photographers. Carl rides up and does a few donuts, spinning the bike's back wheel on the tarmac and turning circles as Allison and her group stare incredulously, with Carl enveloped in a cloud of burnt-rubber smoke. Allison is transfixed as Carl does another donut. Taking off his helmet, he strides out of the cloud of smoke, heavy-browed, and walks up to Allison, as the group jog off. Grinning, Carl runs up next to Allison, who frowns. They're at a viewpoint overlooking the city; she smiles and looks at him. They share a lingering kiss and wrap their arms around each other. Reggie holds up his hand to apologize, and Carl and Allison kiss passionately as Reggie glances at his fellow photographers. They all aim their cameras and snap away at the couple, with the vast city spreading out beyond. Carl reaches round and grabs his gown to make sure he's not exposing himself. Outside the homeless shelter, Norm's with Soo-Mi, who sorts through clothes.",
    "865": "A number of urchins climb out of the elephant and slide down ropes, then run across the wasteland and through a restaurant, stealing food. Beggars hold out their hands to rich Parisians as the first urchin leans into a finely dressed couple in a carriage. Gavroche runs across the tops of several carriages and sits on the back of one as it drives through town. Young students join the beggars and urchins, with two standing on a platform. As police arrive on horseback, the students hand out leaflets. The white-haired man goes to his carriage, and his grandson Marius, with the others, punches the air. In his attic room, Marius removes a gold ring from his finger and takes a pistol from a case. A pretty young woman, Eponine, the daughter of the Thenardiers, stands at the door and watches him go thoughtfully. Marius walks out onto the street, stops to let a carriage cross, and is about to walk on when something catches his eye. Across the street, Valjean gives money to a beggar, with Cosette, now a beautiful young woman, beside him. Cosette, seeing Marius watching her, captivates him, gives the beggar a coin, and smiles at Marius as she goes with Valjean. Eponine watches sadly. Thenardier is by a hovel where he approaches Valjean, but Valjean and Cosette have run off. Thenardier grovels and dusts Javert's jacket as Javert looks him up and down. Marius comes over, and as Eponine walks off, he grabs her arm and smiles. The students meet in a tavern, where Marius sits lost in thought, and Enjolras frowns at him. Marius sees Eponine and rushes over to her as she walks out. Marius exchanges a glance with Enjolras and follows her. Cosette is in her bedroom when Valjean enters the candlelit room, showing a scar on his wrist. Valjean sits, and Cosette looks chastened and walks out of the front door. Valjean knits his fingers together. Marius walks down a dark street pursued by Eponine. In the darkness, Marius stands looking through the railings of Valjean's garden as Cosette walks towards him past branches laden with blossom. Cosette gazes at Marius, then returns to the house, and Marius goes, followed by Cosette with Valjean inside. Marius looks down, sees Cosette's handkerchief, picks it up, and walks off. Eponine looks down sadly and disappears into the shadows. Thenardier walks down the street with one of his cohorts, Babet, and slaps Eponine. Cosette looks desperate as Valjean puts a candlestick in her bag, and Cosette seals a folded letter with wax. She runs out to the garden, slots the letter in the railings, and Eponine emerges from the shadows to take the letter.",
    "1213": "En-Joo runs out of ammo and takes a grenade from a fallen soldier, pulls the pin, and throws it. Reese rifle-butts a soldier in the face, then shoots another, while Lewis shoots from behind a tree trunk. Diaz twists the neck of a soldier and stabs him. En-Joo climbs up a flight of wooden stairs and finds another rifle, then begins popping away. Rambo runs out of ammo and takes cover behind a gun as Sarah looks over with concern. A soldier hurls a primed grenade at En-Joo; Lewis shoots the soldier, but the grenade has found its target, and En-Joo's bloody carcass is hurled to the ground. Rambo ducks down, finds a box of ammo, tears it open, and starts reloading the gun. One of the volunteers gets away, followed by the commander armed with an automatic pistol, and Michael sees him. The commander aims at the volunteer's back, and the volunteer pitches forward in the dirt as the commander runs away. Rambo continues his reloading as soldiers surround his position. He ducks as hot metal whizzes by, and Michael watches as a soldier crawls toward Lewis' position. The soldier shoots Lewis in the shoulder; Michael leaps on the soldier, and they tumble together down a short incline. Michael finds a rock in the sand and pounds the soldier in the head into bloody unconsciousness, his face a mask of indignant fury, then horrified, he slumps onto the sand. Fire rips through the battleground, and a soldier flies through the air, his uniform on fire. A man in an orange top loads a mortar rocket into a launcher on the hill as a collection of people in khaki and civilian colors pour down the hill. Rambo completes his reload and fires into the remaining troops. On the hill, a rebel loads another mortar into the launcher and covers his ears. BN jumps over a tree trunk, rolls, and fires on troops. The commander runs towards a group of his soldiers, gesturing behind him, and they begin a retreat but are picked off one by one. The commander has to make his strategic withdrawal by himself. BN notices the patrol boat as it rounds a headland in the river and scrambles down an incline towards the waterside. The gunner on the boat starts firing on the shore, and the shells obliterate the canopy on Rambo's boat. The patrol boat is armed with a flamethrower and a machine-gun; a jet of flame belches towards the shore, engulfing rebels. Rambo fires on the boat, tearing through the metal wall of its cabin, then takes a hit and falls from the machine-gun platform as Sarah covers her ears. A sheet of flame catches a volunteer in a brown shirt, who rolls in the sand.",
    "791": "The elf shakes his head sadly as Santa mooches inside past his less than impressed elf. In the store's vault, Santa uses a heavy drill to bore through the door of a locked safe. Out on the shop floor of the store, the elf walks along towing a small hand cart, while Santa pulls out the drill from the safe door. On the shop floor, his little helper helps himself to an expensive handbag from a display cabinet, then some women's designer shoes, all of which are detailed on a list. He checks his list while eyeing a string of pearls in a cabinet, and uses a bead rack to smash it open. Later, he joins Santa in the vault and finds Santa peering through the hole he drilled. Santa uses a chisel, opens the safe, and wards of notes spill out onto the floor. An oriental woman sits at the wheel of a van as Santa and his little helper climb in the back with their booty. She turns to the elf, puts her foot on the accelerator, and the van speeds off, throwing Santa and the elf backwards. Later, Santa, who in less seasonal times goes by the name of Willie, dances with Marcus, the elf, in a bar. Willie puts down Marcus on a bar stool by the counter and sits down beside him. He calls over to the barmaid, who serves them. Willie and Marcus raise their glasses, down their drinks, and set the glasses back down on the counter. Marcus gives Willie a dubious look and looks expectantly at him, who considers and then turns to the barmaid. He turns back to Marcus with a half smile and looks down doubtfully at his empty glass. A plethora of beautiful bikini-clad women adorn the sand as Willie, now in a Hawaiian shirt, stands behind the counter of a beachfront bar, chopping up some lemons and limes. He puts them under the counter and pours a generous measure of vodka into a tumbler. As he does so, an irate man clutching a tray of glasses joins him behind the counter. Willie slurps at the drink, and the barman punches him in the guts and tosses him over the counter. Willie throws a vodka bottle at the barman and misses it. The barman leaps over the counter, and Willie runs for it. Willie does as suggested. Sometime later, he's sitting alone having a good leech at some more bikini-clad lovelies playing volleyball. He licks his lips as he admires their well-toned backsides and sips from a bottle of beer. The next morning, Willie is asleep on his bed in a not-so-awful, not-so-great apartment. He reaches over to the clock radio, which is surrounded by last night's empties, and fumbles for the off button; unable to find it, he rips it out of its socket.",
    "1180": "They count piles of money with nobly skinny fingers at the counter as the clerk puts down his quill. Hagrid digs into his pocket and hands over an envelope marked \"top secret.\" They travel on an underground railway and the goblin guide gets off the train. Hagrid hands over a key, and he and Harry follow the goblin along the dank, gloomy passage until a goblin stops beside a door. Hagrid takes the lamp, gives him the key, and turns it in the lock. The heavy steel door opens, and Hagrid shines the lamp inside the vault, causing Harry to blink in amazement, gazed by the sight of vast piles of gleaming golden coins. The goblin guide runs a long, sharp fingernail down the center of the locking mechanism on the door of vault 713. As the door swings slowly open, Harry stares in surprise as the lamplight illuminates a very small, badly wrapped package tied with string. Hagrid steps inside the vault, snatches up the package, and puts it in his pocket, to which Harry nods in agreement. Back in Diagon Alley, Harry consults his list and opens the door of Ollivanders, going inside and gazing around the deserted shop at the shelves full of dusty boxes. An old man slides into view on a ladder, climbs down, and looks along a shelf, taking a long, narrow box from it and carrying it to the counter. He opens the box and holds out a wand, which Harry takes gently and looks at him before waving it, causing drawers to fly open and wand boxes to catapult onto the floor. Mr. Ollivander chooses another box, opens it, and Harry waves the second wand, shattering a china vase. Mr. Ollivander picks out a third box, ponders for a moment, looks at Harry thoughtfully, then carries the slim box to the counter and carefully opens it, taking out a slender wand of polished wood and holding it out. Harry grips the wand, and a bright light shines as a breeze blows through his hair. Mr. Ollivander points at Harry's forehead just as Hagrid knocks on the window and holds up a beautiful snowy owl in a cage. At the Leaky Cauldron Pub, touching his scar, Harry is at King's Cross Station, where passersby stare up at the huge Hagrid, who takes out his watch as Harry reads the ticket, but Hagrid has disappeared, leaving behind his pet snowy owl perched in its cage on top of Harry's luggage. Harry pushes his trolley across the station, finds Platform 9, but the next platform is Platform 10. He spots a porter, follows a woman and her family as she holds a little girl by the hand, and four red-haired boys hurry behind. The tallest boy pushes his trolley towards a solid brick wall and disappears.",
    "1018": "Mike and Abby clasp hands and hold each other around the waist as they sink down, moving their shoulders seductively from side to side. They turn, round and round, moving smoothly to the music, and Abby leans back on Mike's arm as they dance with their hands held palm to palm. They hold hands above their heads as Mike sinks down, and Abby sways rhythmically to the music while Mike caresses her hair and runs his hands down her sides. Abby spins out, swishing her hair around, and Mike pulls her close as they continue to dance, smiling happily. Abby wraps her arms around Mike's neck and they dance close, as he spins her back and forth, then pulls her closer. Abby and Mike's noses almost touch, and they gaze at each other with their mouths slightly open, as if they're about to kiss. Abby blinks, surprised, and Mike forces himself to nod. Abby smiles nervously and heads off, with Mike following, looking dazed. Abby carries her shoes as she walks with Mike to an elevator, and he presses the call button. Mike turns and faces Abby, and they both fidget awkwardly before stepping into the elevator and standing side by side. Mike presses buttons and loosens his jacket as she flashes a smile at him. They hug, and he stops the doors from closing so they can hug again. Mike and Abby suddenly wrap their arms around each other and kiss hungrily, with Mike pressing Abby against the edge of the open door. The doors close, and Mike's mouth hangs open as he walks off, looking shocked. Abby lets herself into her room, looking equally surprised, and lets her jacket and bag fall to the floor, dropping her key on a table and flopping onto a couch, frowning. She takes off her shoes and flings them aside, then leaps to her feet, smooths out her tight-fitting beige dress, and goes to the door. She opens the door and looks horrified as they kiss, with Colin's shirt covered in champagne, which he takes off to reveal his toned chest. Meanwhile, Mike marches along a corridor, stops and turns around, then turns back and keeps walking before turning again and gesturing emphatically. Mike walks up to Abby's door and knocks, and Abby stares at him. Abby goes into the room, then quickly reemerges and runs down the corridor after Mike, who stops and turns to face her. Abby frowns and steps closer to Mike, staring at him intensely. Mike shakes his head, and Abby's smile gives way to a hardened expression as she watches him go with an anxious, thoughtful expression. Mike wanders off with his hands in his pockets as Abby returns to her room. Abby walks into the room where Colin is sitting on the edge of the bed, wearing a fresh, unbuttoned shirt.",
    "504": "Louise glides right back onto the road as if nothing unusual has happened at all, and they realize they have not been spotted. J.D. and Louise look at each other. Hal is on the phone to the FBI man, and Darryl is sitting on a chair looking dazed while other law enforcement types roam around the house. Max Stratton, an FBI man in his early forties, is looking at the ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma. The T-Bird barrels down the road at high speed as Louise, Thelma, and J.D. pull into the motel parking lot. Louise looks at J.D. in the back seat and takes the keys out of the ignition, gets out of the car, and goes inside, where an older woman behind the counter is looking at a computer screen. Louise is startled and turns around quickly as J.D. climbs out of the car, looking very uncomfortable. Jimmy is smiling, and Thelma is watching as Louise turns to face Thelma. J.D. attacks her again, causing Thelma to gasp, and Louise studies Thelma closely as she squirms in her seat, barely able to contain herself. Thelma is just laughing hysterically, and Louise suddenly understands, getting a bad feeling. She is already standing up, putting money on the table, while Thelma has forgotten all about the money, and they are both leaving the restaurant now. As they hit the door, they both break into a full run. Louise is stoic, fighting tears, and she sits down on the sidewalk in front of the room. Thelma comes and sits beside her, and neither one says anything for a moment until Louise quietly starts to fall apart, causing Thelma to leap into action. Louise is still sitting on the sidewalk but slowly gets to her feet. The rear wheel of the green T-Bird lays rubber out of the motel parking lot as Thelma and Louise, both looking a little rougher than we've seen so far, drive away. Hal, the FBI man, various other police and detective types pull up in front of the house, and the front door swings open to reveal Darryl looking like he's been shot out of a cannon. As Louise and Thelma pull into a convenience store, police are tapping the phones, dusting for prints, etc., while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner with a dull expression on his face. Max joins them as they walk down the hallway. Thelma and Louise sit in the car, and Louise looks at her as Thelma shrieks with excitement, leaving Louise completely stunned and shooting her a look. Thelma puts the car in gear and floors it out of the parking lot, still looking at Louise as if she has completely lost her mind. Hal, Max, various other cops, and Darryl all watch as TV plays back VCR tape of Thelma in the convenience store pulling a gun.",
    "870": "A beam of light shines out from a lighthouse and sweeps across a shimmering blue ocean. The woman, Kate Armstrong, raises her eyebrows. In a tidy restaurant kitchen, Kate, a pretty brunette in her late 30s, ties a dazzling white chef's apron around her waist. She checks some orders attached to a shelf. Kate steps into a walk-in fridge and leans wearily against a rack. In the restaurant, she chats to a middle-aged couple. Mr. and Mrs. Peterson leave. Kate shakes hands with another couple and makes her way back through the restaurant. Ken and his wife walk off. In the kitchen, to her chefs, the busy chefs carry on with what they're doing. Holding two plates of food, Kate turns around, her lips pursed as she contemplates their response. Snow falls as Kate walks along a New York street. Her long hair, previously tied up in a bun, now hangs loose under a black beret. She steps through her front door into a modest apartment. She drops her keys into a bowl on top of a cabinet and places some mail down beside it. She checks her phone messages. Kate's fast asleep in bed. Kate blearily raises her head and reaches out and turns off her alarm clock. It's half past four. At a fish market, Kate's cooking at home. Kate wears a blue apron over her black top and jeans. She hurries to answer the phone. Kate walks down a flight of stairs in her apartment building. Seeing a neighbor, she turns back. Kate carries on down the stairs, as Sean goes into his apartment. She walks back up the curving staircase to her apartment. She unlocks the door and opens it, stands beside it for a few seconds then closes it again. At her therapist's, Kate garnishes a plate of food. She sits down as he tucks in. Kate turns away. At the restaurant, the waitress collides with a colleague. Pregnant Leah takes the bottle. The waitress, Bernadette, gets it. Kate reluctantly walks over to the phone. Kate turns away from the hubbub of the kitchen as she listens. Her eyes fill with tears. Kate runs down a hospital corridor. She stops at the reception desk and speaks to a nurse, who points to a room opposite. Kate walks into the room, where young Zoe is lying in bed, her eyes closed. Kate walks around the bed and looks down sadly at her niece, who has grazes above and below her right eye. A balding doctor in his 40s stands in the open doorway. Dr. Barton pats Kate on the shoulder and walks away. She stares through the window at the sleeping Zoe. Kate's asleep on a chair next to Zoe's bed.",
    "368": "Young Don Price shines his flashlight on Edward, and a recap of earlier football, baseball, and basketball highlights reveals that Edward beats Don every time, leaving Edward dumbstruck. With all the strength he can muster, he turns and walks down the front steps while she stays in the doorway for a few beats, feeling genuinely horrible for what's happened, but eventually, she goes back inside. We lead Edward as he walks away, tears just starting to form, and he exits the frame, leaving only the sorority house in the background. Edward steps back into the frame, looking at the sorority house, as we circle and he shouts. Sandra and her sisters peer out through the curtains while the tweedy economics professor continues his explanation, but Sandra isn't paying a lot of attention. He switches on the overhead projector without looking at it, causing a titter from the students, but he doesn't notice until a classmate nudges Sandra, who looks up and the professor finally notices what's written there. Walking with her books, Sandra shakes her head, disbelieving, and we look up to the blue sky where a giant sky-written heart floats in the wind. At her sisters' prompting, a just-woken Sandra looks out the second-story window to find the lawn filled with Edward standing amid the sea of flowers. Sandra walks out to him, smiling, confused, joyful, and scared, and out of nowhere, a tear drops down Sandra's cheek. From down the street, the adult Don Price arrives, 230 pounds of football-playing, Skynyrd-loving, fraternity-proud muscle, and he's pissed. A gang of his brothers walk behind him, and Don Price decks him, knocking him down. Edward gets right back up but makes no move to defend himself, unfazed; Don slugs him again, shrugs fine, then proceeds to kick Edward's ass nine ways to Sunday, and as the ass-whupping continues, we see Don Price sitting on the can, pinching a loaf while reading the new Playboy, squeezing down hard, trying to shit the unshittable. Suddenly, he grasps his chest and collapses face-first on the tile, and the same image of Don's dead face on the tile is reflected in The Eye as the thrashing continues. Edward somehow fights his way back to his feet, ready to be knocked down again, and Don is about to slug Edward again when he turns as Sandra pulls off her engagement ring. There's an audible AHH! from her sisters and an OHH! from Don's brothers, and Don stands stunned, his mind reeling. Edward, whose eyes are swollen almost shut, keeps waiting for the next punch as she hands him the ring. Another beat passes, then Don storms off, and Sandra leans over Edward's broken body, his head lying on the daffodils. As the music reaches a crescendo, Edward reaches for his glass of water, but Josephine already has it for him.",
    "1159": "The friends find each other as Death Eaters advance and Ginny points her wand, causing their attackers to vanish. The passages are deserted, but several glass spheres drop from the highest shelves and shatter, prompting the friends to look up in alarm. Luna stands mesmerized by the falling spheres until Neville grabs her arm, and as they run, more spheres plummet from the shelves. They head for the door at the end of a long narrow passage, with the wooden shelves collapsing behind them and sending a cascade of glass spheres crashing down. Crunching broken glass underfoot, they reach the door, which opens, and they run straight through, only to fall into empty space. They land face down beside a large rocky mound, with Harry still clutching the glowing sphere. A stone archway filled with misty vapor stands on the mound as they raise their wands for protection against a group of black-cloaked figures that swoop down. The Death Eaters swirl around them, trailing plumes of dense black smoke. Harry lies huddled on the rocky mound, clutching the prophecy sphere, and cautiously gets to his feet. Ahead of him, a scowling Death Eater restrains Luna with his wand at her throat, while Harry looks around for the others, each held prisoner by a grim-faced Death Eater. Ron struggles, and Hermione's captor tightens his hold as Lucius approaches Harry and holds out his hand. Harry looks around at his friends, helpless in the grip of the Death Eaters, and then back at Lucius' outstretched hand. Bellatrix is holding Neville by the hair and presses her wand to his throat with an evil smile, prompting Harry to place the glowing prophecy into Lucius' hand, which grows dark. Lucius holds it up in triumph but is distracted by a flash of bright light and turns in surprise as Sirius punches him, causing him to drop the sphere, which shatters. The Death Eaters release their captives, and Bellatrix disappears as flashes of light bring reinforcements, including Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley, and Lupin. A Death Eater advances, but Sirius fends him off and pulls Harry to safety, while Nymphadora helps Luna and Hermione. Lucius draws a wand from his stick and aims at Harry, joined by another Death Eater. Shoulder-to-shoulder, Sirius and Harry fight Lucius and the Death Eater in front of the stone archway as Death Eaters swoop above their heads, trailing black smoke. One heads for Moody, who taps his stick and hurls the Death Eater away backwards. Sirius congratulates Harry and disarms Lucius, sending him hurling backwards as Bellatrix attacks, causing Sirius to stagger. He gives Harry a faint smile before being drawn away through the stone archway and gradually disappearing into the swirling, misty vapor beyond, leaving Sirius gone. Distraught, Harry tries to follow.",
    "712": "They hurry through a door to a gymnasium. Jack places his hand on Rose's cheek, and Rose places her gloved hand over his. She steps outside, and Jack watches her leave through a wavy window glass, then gazes downward. Later, in the first-class lounge, Ruth, Rose, the Countess, and another woman drink tea. Rose gazes toward another table where a woman pulls a slouching young girl upright, and Rose watches the girl place a napkin on her lap with her small gloved hands. Jack leans on a railing for balance and stares into the sea as wind ruffles his hair. Rose steps across the deck toward him, and he turns and faces her; Jack smiles, and Rose walks toward him and reaches out. They hold hands, and Jack gently pulls her toward himself. Rose closes her eyes, and grasping her hand, Jack helps Rose onto the bow, rail platform. They both step onto the lowest rung of the railing, and then she holds her arms out like wings as the wind blows her shawl back on her outstretched arms. He places his hands around her waist as she opens her eyes. Black smoke trails from the ship's funnels as Jack and Rose stand at the rail high above the water. Jack reaches out and grasps Rose's hands and leans his face close to hers. Jack folds Rose's arms around her waist, and she turns his face to him, and they kiss. Rose places her hand on the back of Jack's neck. The sunken Titanic sits on the bottom of the ocean as the elderly Rose turns from a monitor and addresses the crew of the salvage vessel. Rose gazes back at the monitor, which shows the underwater image of the fireplace in her former suite. The room transforms into its former state as young Rose and Jack step inside. Jack rushes toward a painting, and Rose opens the safe. Rose hands the Heart of the Ocean necklace to Jack, who shakes his head as he examines the faceted blue diamond, and then Jack turns to Rose. Later, Rose removes the butterfly comb from her hair and shakes out her hair, which falls to her shoulders. Jack drags a settee to the center of the room and places one pillow atop another. Sitting in a chair near the settee, Jack opens a canvas bag, removes a knife and a thin stick of charcoal which he sharpens, and looks up as Rose steps into the room. Holding a kimono close with one hand, Rose lifts a sash and twirls it. Jack smiles as Rose steps toward him, and he sits back as she tosses a dime to him. Rose steps backward, then slips the kimono from her shoulders, and the kimono slides to the floor. Naked, Rose runs her fingertips over her own thigh.",
    "852": "They pass a sign. The back window shatters as Gabriel lands on the roof, ripping the lights off and punching the roof with his fists. Jeep shoots up at it, and Gabriel falls but clings onto the back. Jeep shoots at Gabriel, and the car swerves, causing Gabriel to knock over his hand, making the flare go off in the car. Gabriel tries to hold himself in the back window, grabs Audrey's arm, and punches her. He grabs Jeep's gun arm, and Jeep tries to fight him off. Charlie keeps hold of her baby while Gabriel clamps his hand over Jeep's eyes. Jeep puts his foot down, and the car swerves all over the road. Audrey grabs Gabriel around the throat as the speedometer creeps past 90 and hits 110. Jeep slams on the brakes, and Gabriel hurtles out of the front window, tumbling onto the road. The car leaves the road, hits a hump, and rolls into a ditch, landing on its roof. Jeep is upside down in his seat with his head pressed against the roof while Charlie manages to get out. Jeep struggles to get out of the car and stands up next to Charlie, who shakes her head and supports him. Jeep and Charlie, holding the baby, climb up a steep hill, struggling for handholds as the gradient increases. Jeep looks up in the sky as Gabriel swoops down out of the light sky and lands just in front of Jeep, knocking him cold with a single punch. Charlie tries to run but finds herself on the edge of a cliff top as Gabriel turns to her and holds his hand out. She looks at the baby and shakes her head while Gabriel eyes her steadily. Jeep leaps on Gabriel's back and they fall over the cliff, landing on the ground below. Gabriel tosses Jeep aside and draws a knife as he advances on him. Jeep stares up at Gabriel, who towers over him with the knife ready. As Gabriel raises the knife to strike, Michael descends from the heavens in a dazzling ray of light. Gabriel looks down, then his face contorts in anger, and he lunges at Michael with the knife. Michael hacks him with his sword, causing Gabriel to drop the knife and fall to his knees as gouts of blood drip off Michael's sword. Jeep sits up as Michael steps over to Gabriel, placing the tip of his sword on Gabriel's chin. Michael stares at Gabriel but doesn't move, then shakes his head, lowers the sword, and steps away. Gabriel gets to his feet, looks down, spreads his wings, and takes off. Michael turns to Jeep, who gets up.",
    "90": "He reaches for his wallet and forces a laugh. The policeman thoughtfully pats the fifty into the bill-fold and hands it back into the car. Carl's nervous smile fades as there is a whimpering sound. The policeman hesitates and leans forward into the car, listening. Grimsrud reaches across Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair, and slams his head down onto the car door. With his free hand, Grimsrud pops the glove compartment, brings a gun out, and reaches across Carl, shooting at the back of the trooper's head. Jean screams as he releases the policeman, whose head slides out the window and whose body flops back onto the street. Carl looks out at the cop in the road, gets out, and leans down to hoist up the body. Headlights appear: an oncoming car that Grimsrud notices as the car approaches, slowing. Carl, with the trooper's body hoisted halfway up, is frozen in the headlights. The car carries the silhouettes of two occupants in front as Grimsrud slides into the driver's seat. The car accelerates, roars past, and away. Grimsrud squeals into a U-turn, the driver's door slamming shut with his spin. He takes the cigarette from his mouth and stubs it in his ashtray. Small red tail lights fishtail up ahead as Jean starts screaming in the back seat. The red tail lights ahead start to turn, and with a distant crunching sound, they disappear. The headlights now show only empty road, starting to turn the car. Grimsrud is not gaining on the tail lights, so he frowns and slows. The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield abutting the highway as Grimsrud applies brakes. Jean slides off the back seat and thumps into the leg-well. His headlights show the car up ahead off the road, crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to hold a turn. Grimsrud sweeps his gun off the front seat, opens his door, and gets out. A young man in a down parka is limping across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. Grimsrud strides calmly out after the injured boy, raises his gun, and fires. With a poof of feathers, a hole opens up in the boy's back, and he pitches into the snow. Grimsrud walks up to the wreck and peers in its half-open door, where a young woman is trapped inside the twisted wreckage, injured. Grimsrud raises his gun and fires. A blue-winged teal in flight over a swampy marshland. The room in which it hangs is dark, and the continuing track reveals a couple in bed, sleeping. The man, fortyish, pajama-clad, is big and big-bellied with his mouth agape. He snores while his arms are flung over a woman in her thirties, wearing a nightie, mouth also open, not snoring.",
    "994": "Nick grins as Gatsby heads up the steps to the house, and then Nick starts to walk away. Nick turns to Gatsby, who nods, and Nick smiles thoughtfully as Gatsby carries on up the grand staircase. Nick then turns to go, as Gatsby stops at the top of the steps and looks up at the mansion thoughtfully. With a servant on either side, Gatsby walks on to the house. In his doctor's office, Nick sits at a typewriter when a female member of staff brings breakfast on a tray for him, while photographers crowd around a car. Gatsby and Daisy make love and lie in bed together in the dark, with curtains billowing in the open windows, as photographers continue to stake out the mansion. Gatsby and Daisy lie next to each other in bed, then stand at the end of the dock looking across the bay. Gatsby looks around and sees Herzog nearby, and Nick looks unsure as Gatsby looks around again to see Herzog lurking in the shadows. Herzog turns and walks off while Nick is lost in his thoughts, as Tom lights a cigar and Gatsby and Daisy look apprehensive. Servants attend to them at the Buchanan's, where Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan sit around a dining table, and Gatsby wears a pale-pink suit. Tom paces as the bay is calm, and Gatsby frowns heavily while Tom glances at Gatsby, who points, and Daisy looks nervous. Gatsby gets up as Tom looks out, and Gatsby looks down at Daisy, who looks increasingly anxious, while Tom squints at the green light, which flashes at the top of wooden posts. Gatsby moves his hand towards Daisy's on the white tablecloth, but she pulls away abruptly, and attempting to light a cigarette, Daisy fumbles with the lighter and drops it. Gatsby picks it up for her as Jordan, Nick, and Tom watch, and he lights the cigarette while Daisy cups her hand around his. Gatsby regards Daisy earnestly, and Daisy looks at him with tears brimming in her eyes. Glowering, Tom steps closer, and Nick listens with interest as Tom stubs out his cigar. Daisy marches off down the hall with Jordan following, and Tom looks at Gatsby and then walks off. In the drive, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg is driven up along with Tom's smaller blue coupe. Tom drives ahead with Nick and Jordan beside him while Gatsby and Daisy follow in the coupe, speeding along country roads. Tom drives recklessly at speed, narrowly missing one car and overtaking several others, as ahead a truck has spilled its load of crates of fruit and vegetables. Tom veers around, squashing watermelons, and nearly hits an oncoming car, as they drive on to the filthy gray Valley of Ashes where the oculist's holding a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles stares down unnervingly. They head to Wilson's garage, where Wilson looks ill, and Myrtle watches from an upstairs window.",

Later, elegantly dressed on the porch, Charlotte tries to eavesdrop on Stuart and Skeeter as she waters her plants. He starts walking away. Skeeter, glancing back towards the house, frowns speculatively. She strides past her smiling date. In a diner, shirt sleeves rolled up, he's ordered oysters. They clink oyster and cracker. He reaches across and takes her hand. She responds with a smile. Outside the diner, Stuart grabs her hand. He steps towards her and kisses her on the lips. Mae Mobley is sitting on Aibileen's knee with a picture book. Hilly comes out of her house grimacing. She pushes aside a press photographer. Toilets are scattered on the yard. She cradles her Yard of the Month sign and carries it inside to the amusement of the onlookers. Mae Mobley, with her knickers down, proudly sits on one of the many toilets scattered across the lawn. Elizabeth drags her off. Tenderly carrying Mae Mobley in her arms, Aibileen sets her down on the lawn surrounded by a dozen toilets. She kneels in front of her. Taking hold of her hands, she looks deeply into the child's moon face. They hug each other. Elizabeth, watching coldly from the front door, goes inside. At the Phelan's, Skeeter, Josefo, and Pascagoula are watching civil rights activist Medgar Evers on TV. Charlotte turns off the TV. The servants scoot away. Charlotte grabs Skeeter by the hand. Skeeter pulls away and goes. On a bus on her way home, Aibileen is napping. Henry, sitting nearby, looks up from his book. The bus stops. The driver switches on the inside lights and faces the passengers. Aibileen and Henry, who have been sitting at the back of the bus, hurriedly get out and walk off down the dark street. He goes. Seeing Henry disappear around the corner, Aibileen starts to run. Civil rights activist Roy Wilkins comments. Aibileen trips and falls. Minnie's children leave the kitchen. The three younger ones pile into one bed. The two friends put their arms around each other. With a somber expression, Skeeter flips back to the front cover of the LIFE magazine, which shows the distraught widow comforting her young son. At the foot mansion, Minnie is hoovering down a stuffed standing grizzly bear on a corner dice. She looks towards the fad and steps down from the platform.

    "1349": "The boys gather their wits with lights flashing hauntingly. Joe moves to the locked bulletproof glass door and tries the handle, but it's not going to open. On the other side of the glass, Nelec, momentarily disoriented and breathing heavily, moves away from the bus door to the locked glass separating him from the kids; he tries the handle, but it won't open for him either. Joe and Nelec are face-to-face, and Joe sees the fear in Nelec's eyes, understanding that this is his fate. Somehow, Nelec takes a moment to look into Joe's face to silently repent. Instantly, Joe knows he's about to watch this man's life end. Nelec turns as the creature is busting the bus door, smashing at it to make it bigger so it can get inside. Joe hits again, as does the creature, while Nelec runs out of ammo. Joe hits again, and crash — the window shatters! Glass chunks rain down on the boys, who cover their faces, as Cary sees the creature. With all the boys helping, Joe pulls himself up outside the bus, peeking out to see the creature just fifteen feet away, focused on the door. Joe strains to climb onto the top-side of the bus terrifyingly down the aisle toward him. As the creature descends upon him, in the silence before the final lunge, Nelec eerily and quietly expresses his terror. Standing is hard for heartsick Louis with his hurt legs — suddenly Jack is there, acting the role of Air Force. As the two Soldiers head off, Jack wraps Louis' arm over his shoulders and heads off in the other direction, with Louis looking over at him, confused. On Louis' face is a surprised glimmer of hope. Moments later, tight on a pocket, Joe pulls out his mother's necklace, having taken it from Overmyer's dead body. Cary holds up his backpack. They turn to see a car coming fast, and Joe studies the oncoming car behind him. The car arrives — it's Donny. He gets out of his car, wild- and red-eyed, incredibly happy to see them. Donny looks at Joe, as if it hurts to think. Joe drives while Donny is asleep, with the other boys in the back. Joe quickly turns left into a driveway, but from the direction they just came, more tanks and military vehicles approach, and Joe's eyes go wide — they're stuck. Gunfire continues as Joe and the boys get out of the car fast and run across the street, zig-zagging between the enormous military vehicles.",
    "557": "The study is cluttered with books, and Professor Henry Jones is absorbed at his desk, studying a very ancient parchment volume that lies open on the desk. The page shows a beautifully illuminated picture of what might be a stained-glass window, incorporating a series of Roman numerals. The Professor is not just studying it; he is copying it into his own notebook, sketching with his hand and holding up one finger. The study door is just closing, Indy closing it behind him, just as Herman comes through the front door, still playing the trumpet. Indy reaches for the trumpet, pulling it from Herman's mouth, but Herman continues to spit right into Indy's face. Herman means the sheriff, who now enters the house. Indy shows the Cross, more or less handing it to the sheriff to make his point, and the sheriff takes it casually. Fedora enters the house, followed by Roscoe, Rough Rider, and Halfbreed, and politely removes his hat, holding it in his hand. The sheriff and Fedora are in cahoots, and the sheriff hands the Cross to Fedora. Roscoe reaches in, takes it from Fedora, and runs out the door. Fedora remains behind for a moment, turning and speaking to Indy in an ironic man-to-man way. He holds the hat by the crown and puts it on Indy's head, a show of respect and admiration for the boy. The hat blocks Indy's face, and the brim fills the screen. As the brim tilts up, we see the face of a full-grown Indiana Jones, who is punched in the face while his arms are pinned behind his back. The Man in the Panama Hat, years older now, removes the Cross of Coronado from Indy's belt. It's night, and rain pours down in the middle of a violent storm at sea, with thirty-foot waves crashing across the deck. The two Portuguese sailors, who have Indy's arms pinned behind his back, propel Indy across the deck toward the rail. As they pass a bundle of fuel drums, Indy uses the sailors as leverage to kick up his feet and break open the clamp on the metal bands that hold the drums together. Indy jabs his elbows into the sailors' stomachs and rushes toward the Man in the Panama Hat, who sees Indy coming and hurries toward the ladder that leads up to the bridge. Indy withstands the force of waves crashing on the deck and makes his way to where Panama Hat is climbing the ladder. Indy takes the cross back from Panama Hat, but a sailor delivers a powerful blow to Indy's face, sending the cross flying out of his grip and skittering across the deck.",
    "898": "They glance curiously at the car then resume their conversation. In the backseat, the hulking escapee's chest heaves as he stares fixedly at the red light. Dillinger licks his lips, his head bowed slightly. He reaches his left hand toward the gun nestled in his waistband. The light changes to green and Dillinger puts the car in gear. He glances over his shoulder as he turns on to another street. The escapee looks behind them. With a smirk, Dillinger shifts gears. The Ford speeds away from town as Youngblood keeps watch out the rear windshield. Now, the car cruises beside a field. Dillinger looks at the mechanic. He shakes his head light-heartedly. The befuddled mechanic shakes his head. During an interview, elsewhere, Hoover listens on the radio. He pinches the bridge of his nose. Now at her apartment, Billie sits in a chair, her hands fidgeting anxiously. She rushes to the telephone and leans against a wall as she holds the receiver to her ear. At the telephone exchange, Baum listens. Billie clutches the phone despondently. She lowers her sad, resigned eyes. Dillinger stands inside a phone booth with a faint, tender smile. Billie removes the receiver from her ear and clutches it against the base of her neck, resting her chin on her knuckles. Outside her apartment, two men watch from inside a car concealed underneath a bridge. Later, Purvis sits in a car outside the apartment. Baum climbs into the passenger seat and hands him a file with a transcript from Dillinger's phone call to Billie. Behind them, an el train glides across a bridge, its interior lights glowing in the darkness. A tan car pulls to a stop and Dillinger and Red climb out. As Dillinger heads around the corner, down an icy walkway, Sport steps out of the safe house. Red perches on the side of the car, his gun raised. Marty emerges from the house, behind Sport. Dillinger narrows his eyes and tilts his head. He pulls out his machine gun. Inside, a man waits by the doorway with a gun at the ready. Outside, Red aims his gun at the house. Later, Dillinger and Red burst into a cigar shop. Red grabs two customers. Gilbert stands behind one of the counters. Dillinger gives Gilbert a hard look. Gilbert leads Dillinger and Red upstairs to a dimly lit room. Dillinger takes in the chalkboard-covered walls and the rows of men at desks chattering on telephones. Small overhead lights with green lampshades hang from above next to dangling clusters of phone wires. D'Andrea sits on the corner of the desk. He looks at Gilbert. A blonde man gestures for Dillinger to raise his arms. Dillinger lifts his hands.",
    "727": "They drop onto the deck below. Meanwhile, inside the ship, tables and chairs batter swimming passengers. As the water rises, some are carried up the staircase while others are trapped against the ceiling of the room below. The ornately carved wall clock at the top of the staircase sinks beneath the churning water. As sea water pours into the openings passengers back into the sinking ship. Wearing a life vest, Fabrizio swims past one of the broken window suction slams against the side of the ship, but he braces himself against the windowed frame. He reaches up for a railing but slips. He turns and swims toward open water. Meanwhile, Rose drops onto a lower deck. The ship's baker helps her up. Jack and Rose reunite in the crowd. In one of the lifeboats Cal beats off panicked passengers with an oar. Several cables holding a funnel snap and flail against water like whips. Cal's eyes widen as the huge funnel tips over. Swimming in the water with several others, Fabrizio looks up as the giant funnel falls onto him. It's a wave which washes away several people. A man climbs into Cal's lifeboat but Cal pushes him back into the ocean. Jack and Rose continue to fight their way through the crowd which slowly funnels up another staircase. Inside people cling to columns at the top of the grand staircase. Water surges up an empty corridor, splintering furniture and knocking doors off. Some people in a lifeboat behind the Titanic row furiously as the ship's enormous propellers rise out of the water. Some passengers leap off from the back of Titanic which is now tilted up several stories above the ocean surface. Gripping Rose's hand, Jack leaps through the crowd. They move to a railing and watch as several passengers plunge overboard. Jack and Rose continue on, pressing passed a group of people kneeling around a priest. A few dozen people tread water near the propeller. Jack pulls up towards deck which is now slanted at a forty-five degree angle. They grab onto the railing at the exact spot they first met. Water streams down the exposed propellers as they continue to tilt upward. Kneeling people grab one of the priest's hands as he holds onto a cab stand or rotating shaft with his other hand. Beside Jack and Rose a woman hugs a young boy to her chest. Shivering, Rose clings to Jack as she looks down at the sinking ship. Her breath smokes in the cold air. Rose smiles. Jack hugs her tight and kisses her forehead. Inside a submerged portion of the ship, a woman's lifeless body drifts beneath a large chandelier, her gauzy dress billowing in the water.",
    "1315": "He tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with sleep. In a series of frustrated grunts and groans, he becomes more and more aggravated until, finally, one final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt floating in it. He downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth. Willie’s walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key-box and moves on. As he rounds the corner into the lot, he pushes on the various key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp. He seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps. Willie gets in and drives off. Willie drives. He reaches over into the glove compartment and pulls out the registration. He focuses on the car owner's address. In long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him, pants around his ankles. Willie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever. Willie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple more clanking tries and then grabs his beer and ambles off. Sucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room, methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls. Willie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings until, finally, he exposes a wall safe. A smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope. The safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash. Willie scratches a lottery ticket. He's now wearing a Rolex and some gaudy ring. As she exits, he activates the machine. Willie skips to the next message. Through the heat ripples rising off the pavement, two mirage-like figures cross the infinite asphalt of the Saguaro Square Mall parking lot—Willie and Marcus in Santa and Elf regalia, sweating and panting in the heat. Willie polishes off a pint of Smirnoff's and flips it towards a nearby trash can. He pulls some Tic Tacs out of his pocket. Harrison stomps away and right toward Marcus and Willie as they enter the store. Willie and Marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out. Bob Chipeska watches with them. A Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Willie’s eye. He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world. Willie's reaction worries Marcus. Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth. He is instantly composed.",
    "1282": "An object blasts out, raising clouds of leaves and knocking people off their feet as a child's buggy is blown away and a park bench is ripped from its mountings. An Apache attack helicopter heads into the cloud as a scientist chopper lands in a park, and soldiers file out with weapons raised and torches blazing, followed by scientists wearing hazmat protective suits with glass-fronted helmets covering their heads. They move cautiously through the trees towards the glowing vapor-shrouded object, with torches mounted on rifles cutting shafts of light through the dense gloom, and Helen advances with the others through the mist as the object casts an eerie green glow in the haze. She stands still, concentrating, as lights swirl in the fog cutting brightly through the dissipating mists, and the gathered crowds stare up at the pulsating sphere which is hundreds of feet high. Helen gapes with her mouth open behind her visor as an intense beam of white light sweeps across the ground, and she looks around in alarm as the military arrives in Hummers with heavy machine guns, while police vehicles draw up in convoy and soldiers fan out to firing positions. A soldier arms his .50 caliber heavy machine gun and points it at the sphere as floodlights illuminate the site and police snipers take positions overlooking the park. The Apache circles the sphere as lights blaze out from the interior, then concentrate at the base of the towering object with such power that Helen has to look away and raises an arm to shield her eyes. Police and soldiers stand tensely with their weapons raised as a figure moves in the white blaze of light, and Helen moves towards the hazy figure. As the soldiers prepare to fire, Helen keeps moving slowly forward and approaches the figure near the base of the sphere, hesitating before the figure holds out a human-like hand, which Helen goes to take. Red blood sprays Helen's visor as the figure falls into her arms, and she looks down at the humanoid shape with a featureless face as personnel hurry to help. More lights blaze within the sphere, and everybody looks up, staring, as a humanoid robot some 50 feet high emerges from the sphere with a light shining out from an eye slit in its head. Every weapon becomes inoperable and all the lights go out, as people cringe and fall to the ground in pain from the noise emitted by the robot. It strides forward and looms over Helen, who's still holding the wounded visitor, and it bends its head down towards her, stretching out a vast hand, then withdraws its hand, raises its head, and stands with its arms by its sides as the light in the eye slit goes out. Finally, all the lights, power, and weapons systems are restored.",
    "997": "Nick reacts with a perplexed frown. At the cottage, Nick stands in the shadows, deep in thought. He looks across to Gatsby's mansion and sees the yellow Duesenberg drive up. Nick walks over and finds Gatsby washing Myrtle's blood off the front of the car. The right fender is dented and the windscreen is cracked. Kneeling with a rag and bucket, Gatsby looks around. They cover the car. He points at Herzog, who goes back into the house. With an emphatic gesture and a sharp nod, Gatsby opens the door to the house. He stops and glances around. He looks at Nick and points at the sky. With a cautious frown, Nick walks into the house with Gatsby. The sky lightens. They stand on the dock. Gatsby looks out across the bay. At the garage, Wilson throws Myrtle's pills into a drawer, holds up a revolver and stares at it. He looks into the eyes on the Dr. Eckleburg billboard. A golden sun rises. The bay is calm. Gatsby and Nick sit on the terrace. Gatsby steps out into the sunlight. Gatsby and Nick walk down steps and across the ornamental terrace, towards the pool. Gatsby walks between two tall, stone urns and down some more steps. Nick stays at the top. Gatsby turns to Nick. Gatsby smiles. Nick opens a low, metal gate. He stops and turns to Gatsby. They both smile. Nick looks at him thoughtfully. Nick leaves Gatsby resting on the gate. Gatsby looks up at the sky. Nick heads off along the gravel path beneath the terrace, leading through the ornamental garden. He stops and looks up at Gatsby. Gatsby smiles fondly. Nick smiles back. They wave to each other. Nick sits looking sleepy as others work around him. Gatsby stands by the pool. Wearing a swimming costume, Gatsby dives into the round, azure pool. At home, Daisy sits near a telephone, looking pale and distant. Gatsby swims deep into the pool. Shadowed against a wall, Wilson stalks through the grounds, holding his revolver. Daisy walks towards the telephone and lifts the receiver. Gatsby surfaces as his phone rings. A faint, hopeful smile spreads across Gatsby's lips as he climbs up the steps at the side of the pool. He looks across the bay, to the Buchanan mansion. Herzog answers the phone. Wilson approaches on the side of the pool behind Gatsby. Wilson shoots Gatsby in the back. His body flinches. Herzog looks round. Gatsby touches his chest and looks at his finger. Heavy-browed, his deep blue eyes staring wildly, Gatsby looks again across the Bay of Consequence to the Buchanan's mansion. Gatsby's mouth hangs open. His eyes glaze as the life drains from him. His eyelids droop.",
    "730": "Ice crystals sparkle in Jack's hair as he takes her hand and kisses the back of her hand. Jack smiles, then closes his eyes and winces, while Rose closes her eyes and leans her head against their entwined hands. As one lifeboat returns to the site of the wreck, the dark-haired crewman shines his flashlight over the debris-strewn water, where frozen bodies float amid pieces of furniture, barrels, and other wreckage. Using an oar, the crewman prods several stiff corpses, and leaning over the front of the boat, a sailor pushes bodies out of their path as they row forward slowly. The crewman's flashlight beam illuminates a dead woman and infant floating in the water. Elsewhere in the debris field, Rose lies on her back atop a floating wooden panel, while Jack floats in the sea beside her, his head and arms propped above water. Rose sings to herself as she gazes up at the starry night sky, her hair and eyebrows caked with ice, turning her head as a distant light illuminates the side of her face. The lifeboat passes several yards away from her as she shakes Jack's hand, smiling and rubbing his arm, and sits up. Jack floats motionless with his eyes closed, and Rose shakes him harder, then gazes toward the lifeboat. Between them, the dead crewman floats with the whistle still in his mouth. Rose's smile fades as she stares at Jack and shakes him again; a tear trickles down her nose. Furrowing her brow, Rose chokes back tears as she strokes Jack's hand, while the lifeboat rows further away. Rose trembles as she watches it recede, then lays down her head and closes her eyes. The light of the rescuers' flashlight grows dimmer as they move on, and Rose's eyes pop open as she sits up and pries her hand out of Jack's grip. She kisses his hand, then releases him as Jack sinks in the icy water and vanishes in the gloom. Rose slides on her stomach to the edge of the platform, then rolls into the water, her breath steaming out in clouds, and swims to the frozen crewman to pull the whistle from his lips. Rose continues to blow into the whistle as the rescuers shine their lights on her. On the research ship, the now older Rose opens her eyes as tears stream down Lizzy's face. As dawn breaks over the ocean, Ismay sits silently in a lifeboat with other survivors, while in another boat, a man takes a drink from a flask, then passes it to Cal. Elsewhere, Ruth huddles against Molly, who stares out to sea with a blank expression. Wrapped in a blanket, her face pales as she looks up and is dazed in green light.",
    "962": "David watches her with a mesmerized expression, as Elise wraps her arms around a male dancer's necks and he lifts her. As they rotate together, Elise spreads her legs gracefully. The dancer sets her down, then lifts her by the waist. Two others join him, taking Elise's hands as the center dancer lowers her, then raises her again. Thompson steps up behind David. Turning, David glares at him. David gives him a sidelong look. Thompson's eyes remain on the dancers. David glances at the stage. David's brow creases. He looks squarely at Thompson, but the adjustment officer's gaze remains on the performance. David returns his eyes to the stage, where a dancer tosses Elise into the arms of another. She extends her arms and legs as he spins her. Thompson steps away, his eyes still focused on the dancers. With a puzzled frown, David watches the adjustment officer stop in the studio's doorway. Thompson gazes at the performance, and David follows his eyes back to the stage. Elise bends forward, sweeping her legs straight up into the air behind her. As a male dancer tosses her, Thompson gives a nod and Elise falls. Her face contorts in pain. As David rushes toward the stage, a male dancer picks Elise up and carries her off the platform. He scurries out of the studio with David jogging after them. Thompson turns away from the scene, his face pinched, and strolls through a doorway. Later, Elise rests her head on David's shoulder as they ride in the back of a cab. They pull up to a hospital, and David carries Elise inside. Now still in costume, Elise wears a protective lead apron around her waist as she lies on an X-ray table. An X-ray machine hovers above her feet, aligning a cross-haired light pattern with her ankle. Meanwhile, David sits in a waiting room, his head bowed and his eyes closed. He massages the bridge of his nose with his fingers. Thompson appears in front of him. David punches him in the face. As Thompson stumbles back, two men in the waiting room rise, their eyes on David. Thompson straightens his fedora. Meanwhile, a doctor checks X-rays. With a stern look, Thompson turns away. As he leaves, he tips his hat at one of the men in the waiting room. David stares after him, his chest heaving. He lowers himself back into his chair and bows his head. Later, he stands beside Elise's bed in the emergency room. He touches her bandaged ankle, which rests on two pillows. He wraps his arms around her, squeezing his eyes shut as they hug. With a woeful expression, he opens his eyes and shifts them thoughtfully.",
    "429": "The applause grows louder as the balls keep spinning toward the pockets. Eddie beams with pride and excitement as he accepts the acclamation of the sharks at Ames. He slaps down the chalk and returns to his seat. Fats draws himself slowly out of his chair and hands the money to Charlie. It is almost four o'clock. Fats hesitates for a moment, then reaches in his pocket for some bills. They stand up, remove their jackets, and prepare to play again. As Preacher opens the door to the back room, clutching a paper bag filled with bottles to his chest, we see six men seated around a table, playing poker. Preacher approaches one of them and whispers something hurriedly in his ear. The man is Bert Gordon. Except for his dark glasses, he might pass for a conservative businessman out for an evening with the boys, sipping milk instead of alcohol to soothe an ulcer. He nods to Preacher who then leaves. Bert appears thoughtful for a moment. He rises. Bert sips his milk. A floor full of cigarette butts surround Charlie's chair. Charlie crushes out another on the floor and immediately reaches for more. Eddie drains the last drips from his bottle of bourbon, then looks jauntily at Bert, who now sits quietly in a chair, watching them both. He misses. Eddie squirms out of his seat, eager to play, eager to go on winning. Bert sighs. The shot goes in. Fats opens a fresh bottle of whisky. The game goes on. The shot goes in. The hands of the clock on the wall spin around toward eight in the morning. Only the voice of Sausage is heard, signaling the end of a game. Ames is empty now, except for the players and the employees. As Fats bends over to shoot, Henry draws the Venetian blinds. Bert holds a hand to his temple, unnerved by Fats' discomposure. There is a break in the action. Fats and Eddie eye each other coldly, Fats with his glass in his hand, Eddie with his bottle. Eddie takes a swig and returns to the game. Bert reaches forward to hand Charlie more money. Bert replaces the billfold in his coat pocket. Eddie, weary now, his hands resting on the table, looks up at the cool, impassive face of Bert Gordon. Bert rises, moves his chair about six inches, and sits down again. It sinks. Eddie goes over to the water cooler for a drink while Fats doles out his losings on the table. He stands before Fats and Bert Gordon, waiting for an answer. Fats and Bert exchange glances but nothing is said. Still no reply, no sign of giving in. Eddie starts to go back to his chair, suddenly turns, a weary, clowning smile on his face.",
    "1372": "He leaves the house and heads towards the light while the old man is wandering up to the house carrying a lit torch. He opens the front door, and inside it is just as dark. He begins climbing the stairs, hearing whispers and hushed voices coming from upstairs. The old man waits outside the room where the conversation is taking place and listens on as a snake slithers past him into the room. Wormtail stands in the doorway and looks at the old man, who looks terrified. A loud spell is cast and Harry wakes up in a flash of panic, flustered and still panicking. Hermione goes over to Ron's bed and they shake hands, then walk up the hill. The camera homes in on a boot on top of the hillside and everyone is in a circle, putting their hands on the boot. Harry rushes over and puts his hand on the boot, and there's a white flash, suddenly sending them all flying through the air. Everyone cheers as Harry, Hermione, and the young Weasleys crash to the ground with a thump while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric come down more gracefully. Cedric helps Harry to his feet, and they walk across the field, seeing a massive crowd gathered and cheering, with tents set up all over. They walk into the crowd, taking in the sights and approach a small tent, where Amos and Cedric separate and walk off. They enter the tent, which is many times bigger on the inside than the outside. They take their feet off the table and put them back on as soon as Arthur has walked past. The scene pans up the hillside onto a large stadium with a huge number of floors where the Weasleys and Harry are finding their seats as Lucius Malfoy and Draco walk below them. The ceremonies begin with balloons flying and fireworks going off. Five green and white figures fly through the air on their brooms leaving a colored trail behind them as a glittering leprechaun appears in the sky and starts dancing, making everyone excited. Five red figures appear this time, with one performing a stunt on a broom and another one appearing on the large screen. Viktor Krum waves to the crowd, and Harry joins in. Suddenly, the crowd is panicked and rushing all over, and Harry is trampled unconscious. The crowds have all gone, and a man walks through the rubble kicking at things. He casts a spell that causes a bright flash, and a large ghostly skull forms in the sky with a snake crawling from it. The man grins evilly, clearly demented, as Harry stirs and witnesses him standing there, leading Harry to run. They look at the monstrous thing in the sky as Harry holds his head in pain.",
    "623": "In her immaculate house, Vanessa is sitting alone at the dining room table, sipping a glass of red wine. Mark comes downstairs, approaches her, and pulls up a chair with a faintly smug smile flickering across his face. Mark opens the front door and catches sight of Juno driving off; at his feet, he finds the note she left. Vanessa grabs it from him, and they both read it. Juno parks the Previa in the street outside the family's wooden slatted house, where the porch light illuminates a straw heart hanging on the door knocker. She gets out of the vehicle looking emotionally and physically exhausted. In the front garden, she stops to pick a crocus and solemnly traces a circle across her tummy with its petal. Her mustachioed dad, his bald head gleaming in the bright kitchen light, is busy fixing something at the kitchen table as she comes in. She flops down at the table, and he stares at her belly. Juno nods wryly, then her expression brightens as Mac smiles to himself and continues tinkering. Through the slats, on Bleeker's upstairs window blinds, Juno and Leah can be seen scurrying to the Previa. The next morning, as the track team runs past his house, Bleeker comes out of the front door, opens the mailbox, and a cascade of orange Tic Tac packs fall onto his feet, making him grin in delight. The running team sprints around the track as Bleeker breaks off on spotting Juno coming towards him past a lineup of cheerleaders rehearsing their routine. Smiling, he jogs to meet her, and she takes his hand, placing it on her tummy and clasping it with hers. Their eyes lock, and he smiles. With his hands in the pockets of his brown sweatshirt over his skimpy yellow shorts, he kisses her. Standing on tiptoes, Juno cups his face, while her secret admirer watches sullenly and Leah, doing stretching exercises, grins. Juno gives her the finger, keeping her lips firmly stuck to Bleeker's. Later, she drives a matchbox police car up over the crest of her enormous belly, the little car slips from her grasp, and she rolls her eyes. Mac, Juno, and Bren come hurtling out of the front door with Liberty Bell in her ballet outfit. In the hospital, Leah jokingly steers Juno's wheelchair into a gown trolley. In the birthing suite, Bren, Leah, and the midwife keep their eyes fixed firmly on Juno and the squawking baby attached to his umbilical cord. Juno takes a long look at him, then closes her eyes. Bleeker breaks the tape, looks around for her, runs up the steps of the stand, and away. In the hospital room, Mac gently strokes Juno's hair as she lies on her side in bed.",
    "238": "The friend watches the customer intently as he drops the coins one by one onto the marble. He drops them, puts his ear close, and listens. Two or three coins he discards, but he smiles when others make a pure tone and keeps them. Szpilman exchanges looks with a pretty whore, who makes eyes at him. Satisfied, the customer beams, nods his thanks to Szpilman, who resumes his piano playing. Szpilman is walking. He passes emaciated children and beggars and steps over the corpses lying on the sidewalk. The wall runs the length of the street, dividing it in half and narrowing it, with buildings on one side and the wall on the other. Szpilman walks along. A piercing whistle comes from the Aryan side, causing Szpilman to stop. Two women appear from a doorway, approach the wall, and look up. Two or three packages come flying over from the Aryan side, which the women grab and then disappear. Szpilman walks on and sees a child appear through a hole at ground level. The child wriggles through, then turns, pulls a package after him, and runs. As Szpilman walks on, he hears a noise and looks back to see a second child trying to wriggle through the same hole but is stuck. Angry German voices come from the Aryan side. Szpilman goes to him, pulls him with all his might, but the boy is jammed in the hole. From the other side of the wall, the sound of an angry German voice and of a boot stamping violently on the boy is heard, and the boy screams in agony. Szpilman continues to try to pull the boy through. The sound of the German voice swearing and the dull, crunching noise made by the boot smashing into the boy continues, and with every thud, the boy screams in terrible pain. Szpilman struggles to help the boy whose screams are becoming weaker yet increasingly desperate. Szpilman pulls his arms and finally manages to get him through. The boy lies moaning, his head lolls, and his jaw sags; he is dead. Szpilman stands quickly and hurries away. Szpilman approaches the house through a shabby yard, hearing the noise of a mimeograph machine. A huge, cheerful man with a perpetual cigarette in his mouth laughs and coughs, starts looking through papers. His room is piled from floor to ceiling with old papers and stuff, dark, shabby, and run-down. One of his sons, Symche, is operating the mimeograph machine while the other, Dolek, is sorting the sheets as they come off the roller. Mrs. Zyskind, holding a toddler, is cooking at a small stove. A distinctive knock on the door makes Szpilman tense, but Jehuda beams and gestures to one of his boys, saying \"Symche.\" The boy opens the door to admit a short, neat man, Majorek.",
    "680": "Two webs lift a power cable as a shield, and the points of the pincer pierce the cable, causing an enormous surge of electricity to shoot up the limb to Octavius. Spider-Man struggles to pull out more cables but succeeds, and both men are hurled through the air. Spider-Man sees the severed cables, but the sphere keeps drawing metal objects to it. He stands before it with his hands apart as more and more pieces of the structure of the lab are sucked into the glowing sphere. Beyond the lab, on the streets of New York, lamp posts, taxis, and cars are drawn towards the building and the tritium. Octavius, sitting in the water, regains consciousness, and Spider-Man hears a water-logged limb, running over to Octavius, who looks puzzled. Spider-Man removes his mask, and Octavius watches as more metal is pulled into the sphere. A submerged limb rises, and Octavius' face changes as a limb places its pincer around Peter's neck. Octavius nods, and their pincers close, with the tips of the limbs looking like serpents' heads. Octavius' dark eyes glean, and he blinks, then raises an eyebrow as more debris is sucked in. The limbs watch Octavius and move threateningly towards his face as the pincer around Peter's neck loosens off, and a limb stops him. The unmasked Spider-Man watches as the four limbs raise Octavius aloft and carry him towards the golden orb floating in the fusion chamber. When they are almost upon it, the limbs stop, and Octavius turns, his face grim and somber. The two men stare long and hard at each other before Octavius about-turns and bounds towards the sphere. Spider-Man, still without the mask, spins round to see the incredulous look on MJ's face as she recognizes him, and her face breaks into a smile. Peter watches her fondly, then spots beams and a girder toppling as the whole side of the building crashes down towards her in one, prompting him to sprint to hold it up. MJ is lying on the floor as he stands above her, looking down intensely before bending under its weight. Meanwhile, Octavius is under the fusion chamber, looking up at the sphere, using the limbs to remove the support girders as the chamber and the lab start to sink. Peter struggles to hold up the side wall and nods as the chamber crashes down into the river beneath it, taking the sphere and Octavius with it. Peter exerts all his strength to throw the side wall after it, then reaches down to MJ, removing a wooden beam trapping her. They turn to see a revolving mass of metal speeding towards them. Holding MJ in his arms, he leaps up and uses a web to carry them away from the sinking laboratory.",
    "928": "Greene's car arrives in town, and they drive through quiet cobbled streets past a bubbling fountain. Bond is following his GPS tracker as Greene arrives at a large, very modern leisure complex where he and the German are wearing tuxedos. Crowds of people in evening dress are arriving by riverboat and milling in the foyer as Greene walks upstairs. A huge glitter ball and other equipment are being wheeled on trolleys, and a poster advertises Tosca. A man crosses the staging area and descends some stairs to the Kunslerangang, the artists' entrance, where in a dressing room, makeup is applied, and costumes are checked, including one actress having a wound painted on her forehead. Bond walks down a plain white corridor, opens a door, and steps inside as guests gather in a reception area in the form of a cube built over the theater entrance. Greene oozes charm as he shakes an older man's hand while his German companion drifts off. The performers are getting changed, and a well-muscled actor checks two wardrobes but can't find his clothes. Bond joins the theatergoers wearing a tuxedo as Greene's crony carries a bag. Bond looks down at the revelers from a balcony and spots Greene and his friend sipping champagne and talking to two elegant women. He watches as white-shirted hostesses give out gift bags to guests and follows the guests with a gift bag into the toilets. The crowds move into the auditorium as Greene and his friend, carrying their gift bags, are welcomed into a private box. Bond empties the bag into a basin, picks up a small pin in the shape of a letter Q, then opens up a box and takes out a small earpiece. Greene does the same, settling in his chair, while the guest Bond followed in is slumped in the corner. He steps out of the toilet and rips off the door handle as the singer is raised up the set on a decorator's cradle. Bond is backstage behind the set featuring a huge moving eye and climbs up a walkway. Greene is watching from his box as Bond climbs flight after flight up metal stairs. Greene's friend looks around and smiles weakly at a grim-faced man standing at the back of the box, who stares at him. From a high gantry, Bond looks out at the vast packed amphitheater as Greene's eyes widen, and all over the auditorium, men stand up and make their way out. Bond takes photos with his phone, intercepts the intruder, and takes him out with a fist and a knee before heading back downstairs. The speaker is Mr. White, and on stage, the dungeon lid is slammed. Upstairs, Greene clears out of his box as Bond emerges near the side of the stage, removes his earpiece, and walks out just yards away from where White is sitting.",
    "221": "As Pappy brushes by them, Junior wheedles, and Pappy slaps at the young man with his hat and waves it at the radio building as singers in faux hillbilly outfits with various musical instrument cases get out of the second car. Tommy sits in the background, playing and singing a slow blues while the three convicts, holding coffee cups, gaze into the fire. He stretches out, and Pete swishes his coffee as he stares into the blaze, giving his coffee a thoughtful swish and murmuring. The three men tense up as Pete shovels dirt onto the fire and Delmar and Everett scramble to peek over a low ridge. Their point-of-view shows a lone barn with their car parked to one side surrounded by various police vehicles that have pulled up facing the barn. Armed men, their backs to us, train guns on it, some taking cover on the near side of their parked cars. The man with the bullhorn continues, directing his comments at the distant barn, while the three convicts notice the sheriff who once again stands impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a leash against which a bloodhound strains. The three men shuffle down the dusty road, losing their drift as all three turn, reacting to the sound of an approaching speeding car which comes into view cornering on two wheels. It crashes back onto all four, and as it speeds along, dollar bills snap and flutter out its windows. The car roars up to the three men as Delmar waggles a hopeful thumb and it screeches to a halt. The driver, a young man in a sharp suit with a round, babylike face, leans over to call through the passenger window as Delmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill out of the air, looks at it wonderingly, holds it stretched between two hands, brings the two sides together, then gives it an appraising pop. Like a child gazing at soap bubbles, Delmar looks around at the wafting currency and yanks another fluttering bill out of the air. The three men climb in, the car squeals out, and the driver shoots a glance up to the rearview mirror as the sirens grow louder, then gropes inside his coat. The man stops withdrawing the gun and appraises his passengers as Delmar reacts to the paper currency fluttering inside the car. He opens his door, steps onto the running board, giving Everett a casual gesture, and Everett slides over, startled. George Nelson, now fully outside and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped on the car roof and waves to Delmar with the other while sending a spray of bullets back at the pursuit car. Nelson fires wildly as the pursuit cars gain on him, returning fire.",
    "530": "He leans over and kisses her. Mickey, his hands in his pockets, walks along the sidewalk, one person among many other pedestrians. He pulls his coat tighter around him as he walks. He glances inside and sees Holly, her jacket flung over her shoulders, looking at some records. Mickey walks through the revolving doors of Tower Records, up a few stairs to the selling floor proper, and stops right in front of Holly. Holly chuckles and turns to look at more records. She walks down the aisle, occasionally glancing at the bins of records. Mickey walks beside her. Mickey walks back onscreen to Holly. The two of them are partially obscured by a large white Jazz sign imprinted with a large red circle as they continue their conversation. Mickey pulls out a record and looks at it. Holly looks hopefully at Mickey. Holly laughs, embarrassed, as Mickey puts the record he's been looking at back in the bin. Holly chuckles, looking off for a moment. There is a brief pause and the movie cuts to the screen showing a chaise in Mickey's apartment; an ashtray on a stand sits nearby. The camera moves down the chaise, past several piles of books, to Mickey's coffee table. He sits, picking at his fingers and listening, on the edge of the table in front of Holly, who is sitting cross-legged on the floor, propped up with a pillow, reading her script aloud. Holly closes the script and looks up at Mickey. Mickey smiles and shrugs, not knowing what to say. Holly, thrilled with Mickey's overwhelming response, stands up, her hand on her head. Unable to contain herself, she begins to walk up and down the room, holding her script. The camera follows her; Mickey is now offscreen. Trees line the sidewalk. Holly and Mickey emerge from the door and walk up the street, revealing a whole row of similar apartment buildings. They pass a few other people as they walk. The film then moves to the outside of a charming glass and stained wood café. Through the window, Holly and Mickey can be seen having lunch. Holly is talking animatedly; Mickey takes a sip of coffee. Some people pass by. Next, the film cuts to an almost isolated path in Central Park, complete with old-fashioned streetlamps and scattered leaves. Holly and Mickey stroll into view, deep in conversation. The film abruptly cuts to Mickey's flashback, a visual counterpoint to the story he is telling Holly. A close-up of a nervous, perspiring, and panting Mickey alone in his apartment appears on the screen as his voice is heard. Mickey raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead. He shuts his eyes tightly. The camera moves past the desperate Mickey to a mirror on the wall behind him.",
    "239": "He stops, seeing Szpilman, and Szpilman shrugs. Jehuda loves this too, but his laugh makes him cough appallingly. The family sits around the small table as Mother comes with a saucepan of soup and starts to serve. He laughs, and the others look at him. The family rushes to the windows as a Gestapo vehicle enters the street and screeches to a halt. Helmeted, jackbooted SS men, led by an NCO, pour out of the vehicle. The Szpilmans gather at their open window to watch, and Regina turns off the lights before joining them; they are all terrified. From the POV of the Szpilman apartment, they see the building opposite. The SS men are pouring into the building opposite, and the sound of jackboots on stairs is heard. Lights go on floor by floor. In an apartment directly opposite, a businessman, his wife, three young people, and an old man in a wheelchair sit at their dining table. The SS men burst in, machine pistols at the ready. The family is frozen with horror and remains seated as the NCO scans their faces. The family rises to their feet fast, except for the old man in the wheelchair. The NCO bears down on him, and the old man in the wheelchair grips the arms of the chair, trying desperately to stand, but he can't. Without warning, the SS men seize the chair with the old man in it, carry him out onto the balcony. Mother screams, Father shrinks back, Halina comforts him, and Regina comforts Mother. From Szpilman's and Henryk's POV, they see the apartment opposite where the SS men throw the old man in his wheelchair over the balcony. He seems to hang in the air for a second, then drops out of the chair and out of sight, followed by a terrible thud as his body hits the pavement and a clatter as the wheelchair follows him. Mother is sobbing, and the others are still horrified. Then, there's the sound of shots, slamming doors, screams, and shouts. From their POV, from a second window, they see the building opposite and the street where the SS men are herding a couple of dozen prisoners from the building opposite. People are watching from the windows but trying not to be seen. The headlights of the SS vehicle are switched on, and the SS men are forcing their prisoners to stand in the beam. The prisoners start to run, and the SS men open fire with a machine gun mounted on the vehicle. People in the building opposite begin to scream. The prisoners are being shot down, lifted into the air by the bullets, turning somersaults, and falling dead. One man escapes by running back in the opposite direction, out of the beam of light, and is lost to sight for a moment. The escaping man, a silhouette out of the light, runs with all his strength, putting distance between himself and the SS.",
    "1158": "He turns to go, and Snape turns back and raises his eyebrows. With determination, Umbridge raises her wand in the Forbidden Forest. Harry catches up with Hermione as the frayed end of Gwarp's rope lies on the ground. Umbridge is dirty and disheveled when shadowy creatures appear amongst the trees. Umbridge steps back nervously and wags a finger. They have bows and arrows, and she deflects an arrow. She points her wand, and a centaur falls, a strangling rope around its throat, as it writhes and thrashes. Hermione tries to release it, but Umbridge is lifted into the air by Gwarp. The centaurs charge, firing arrows, and pierced by arrows, Gwarp drops Umbridge. The centaurs grab her, and she is carried off. They run back through the forest towards Hogwarts, where Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron run to meet them. Harry faces his friends, and they, along with Hermione, Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron, soar above the pine forest astride the leathery back of a thestral. Harry holds on tightly and looks around at his companions, and flying close behind, Luna gives him a happy smile. The thestrals fly through the stormy night buffeted by strong winds, and at last, the familiar lights of Canary Wharf and the winding River Thames appear below them. They run through the deserted Ministry of Magic towards a long corridor lined with shiny black tiles. Harry moves forward cautiously, and the others follow him along the black corridor towards the blue door at the far end. Inside is a shadowy storeroom full of high, wooden shelves, and they hold up their lighted wands. Standing on the numbered shelves are thousands of cloudy glass spheres as the door behind them slides away. The rows of glass spheres fill the shelves, which stand close together and extend upwards high above their heads. By the light of his wand, Harry searches the long, dark passages between the shelves and stops to shine his wand down onto the empty floor. He turns to his friends, as Neville is reading a label on a shelf beneath one of the spheres. As Harry walks towards it, the sphere starts to glow, illuminating the swirling mist inside it, and Harry reaches out and lifts it down. Harry steps in front of his friends, and they move closer together as a masked Death Eater approaches slowly along the passage. Lucius Malfoy unmasks, and Harry holds Neville back as dark figures approach down the passageways. The masked figures draw closer, and the friends run for it, but Lucius appears in front of them, so they turn back. Luna is knocked down, but she raises her wand, and her attacker vanishes. Neville stuns a Death Eater, and Luna pulls him away as more Death Eaters appear to block the passages. Pursued, Hermione flicks her wand, and glass spheres smash down onto their pursuers.",
    "785": "Jane is accosted by a smartly dressed older lady, leaving her puzzled and unsure of what she just heard. Having downed Casey's drink, Jane heads for Tess and George, staring challengingly at Tess and stuffing a whole sausage roll into her mouth at once. Tess looks worried as Jane strides off, then turns and grins at her, but her face freezes as Jane looks her in the eye and picks up a folder from the table behind her, while Casey looks bored. Tess smiles at George, and cute baby pictures of the couple fill the screen, showing young George petting a goat, Tess dangling a cat by its hind legs, George in academic robes, cheerleader Tess flirting with footballers, George helping at a soup kitchen, bikini-wearing Tess getting soaked at a car wash, him at the United Nations, her in Europe with two guys, and George helping with an animal charity. Tess tucks into a helping of ribs, and George looks unhappy as slides show him with his proud parents, then Tess in a fight, grimacing at a baby, and being afraid of George's dog. Behind the now not-so-happy couple, Casey gets to her feet, and Jane looks miserable. Tess runs up, and Jane opens her mouth, but no sound comes out. She stands awkwardly, biting her lip, her eyes brimming with tears, as Casey feels her friend's pain while Jane hurries out of the restaurant. Kevin, lurking in the background, follows her out, and she looks at him with wide, tear-filled eyes. He waits for a reaction, turns to walk away, then stops and comes back again. He holds up a PDA phone with a ribbon on it, places it in her hand, gives her a lingering look, then walks away. Jane watches him go with a sad half smile, looks down at the gift in her hand, and chokes back more tears. She arrives back at her apartment, places her bag and keys on the hall table, and idly toys with a flower in one of the many vases occupying every available surface. Kevin is at his desk, staring gloomily into space as Maureen walks up, and he gives a rueful smile and sinks back thoughtfully into his chair. Jane is at her father's store, where Tess freezes upon noticing her. Jane can't meet Tess's furious gaze and is baffled, sitting with her shoulders hunched on the store counter, staring dejectedly at the floor. Back at her apartment, she is idly brushing her teeth when she wanders out of the bathroom and catches sight of the closet full of dresses. She throws open the closet, starts flinging the dresses out into the hall, and soon stuffs the last dress into one of several black plastic bean bags.",
    "863": "He lies on top of Fantine, and her lips tremble. Once finished, he gets off her and saunters away, leaving her on her back. She lies motionless, her head on a pillow. Her rouged face is grim and somber. Fantine looks miserable. She breathes quickly and swallows. Her shoulders heave. She sits up. Her once clear skin is blotchy and smeared with dirt. She strokes her short cropped hair. Her cheeks streaked with tears, Fantine glances behind her. Her expression is solemn. Night in the slum. A punter to a pimp. A smartly-dressed man takes off his hat and grabs Fantine's dress. He presses himself on her. She scratches his face. He pushes her away as Javert approaches. Fantine recognizes Valjean and moves away. She turns her back to him. She breathes rapidly. He recoils as she spits in his face. Javert raises a hand to hold back one of his men. He picks her up in his arms. Javert watches them go. Javert is handed a letter. Standing outside in the snow, Javert opens the letter and reads it. He glances up and screws up the letter. He stands in front of Valjean. His brow furrowed, Valjean gets to his feet. Valjean sits back down at his desk. Javert looks puzzled, then bows curtly and takes his leave. Valjean watches him go, then leans on his desk. In church, he kneels at an altar. He packs money and papers into a case. He takes a carriage to court. They stare at him as the court usher escorts him out. At the hospital, a nurse tends to Fantine, who lies on her back. The nurse dabs her semiconscious patient's forehead with a cloth, then rises and walks out of the room. Valjean enters. An image of the nine-year-old blonde girl. The image has vanished. Fantine becomes still, and her head lulls to one side. Valjean closes her lifeless eyes. He bends forward and kisses her on the temple. Javert draws his sword. Having fended Javert off with a baton torn from the wall, Valjean is disarmed. He but turns, rushes out of the door, and dives into the river below. Javert runs out, but there's no sign of Valjean. Fantine lies at peace in the hospital bed. Cosette, young and grubby, is at the inn. She looks out enviously at children playing in the snow. Cosette glares. A pretty little girl. At the inn, Thenardier hauls himself to his feet and wanders past his subtle clientele. He gives a staggering bloke a drink. A silver-haired gent. He takes the man's reading glasses. His wife messes a soldier's jacket. She gazes at the handsome man. Outside along on a crate by a mule.",
    "925": "The gantry turns, moving Bond away from the gun and pulling Mitchell off the scaffold. The rogue agent lands on a scaffold tower, as Bond pulls at the rope around his leg. He climbs for a gun on the scaffold while Bond tries to reach the one on the ground. Both scoop up the weapons, and Bond fires. The crowds are dispersing in the Town Square as a police car makes its way down a crowded street. Covered in dust, Bond strides through the crowds towards the wooden gate in the tunnel. Blood stains the cellar floor, but the prisoner, Mr. White, is gone. Bond stares dispassionately at the scene. It's raining when a black Range Rover arrives at a high-rise block of flats. M stands looking out from one of the balconies. Bond emerges from the Range Rover and enters through the building's glass door. Ignoring a stolid guard, Bond enters a flat, passes masked forensics officers, and joins M on the balcony. The boffin opens a door for M. Bond's eyes narrow as he is now wearing shades in the back of a taxi, driving down a dusty street. He gets out of the taxi opposite the faded sign and entrance to the Hotel Dessalines. In a dark polo shirt and light trousers, he enters the building and makes his way through the drab-tiled lobby, strung with washing lines. He moves down plain concrete corridors, arrives at a door, and positions himself to one side of it. He uses a tool to pick the lock and enters cautiously, peering around the door into the plainly furnished, empty living room. Closing the door behind him, he walks into the apartment when a switch-blade flicks open. A man leaps through glass doors, swinging the blade wildly. Bond slams him through the glass into the bedroom. The man recovers and swings again, but Bond attacks with the phone. He goes down and finds a pair of scissors. Bond slams him into a wall, gets head-butted, then hits him with a book. He parries the knife blows and grabs the guy's knife hand in a finger-breaking hold. They go through a window out onto a balcony. Bond has him by the throat and drives the scissors into the guy's neck and thigh. Bond's completely unmoved as the guy rolls his eyes in agony, then dies, blood pooling beneath his head. He goes to search the rooms, taking a shirt from a wardrobe and ripping it to make a bandage for a cut on his arm. He shrugs on a shirt and wipes blood from his nose. Barely glancing at the body, he grabs the door keys and heads downstairs. He turns to the young black woman at reception with a grim demeanor.",
    "385": "They seem very unhappy. The woman speaks to Dieter in German. She is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. Notable is her camera-side leg, which ends in a bandage-swaddled foot. Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. Walter's eyes are on the road as he listens, driving, to the Dude, whose speech is occasionally punctuated by yaps from the back seat. He is looking off as the car slows. The Dude looks where Walter is looking. Walter's car pulls up the drive into the foreground and he and the Dude get out. Both are gaping off at the front lawn. BANG--the Dude and Walter push through the double doors into. His wheelchair hums as he spins it around. He is crossing to Lebowski. Walter reaches around from behind and hoists the big Lebowski out of the wheelchair by his armpits. He shoves the big Lebowski forward and he crumples to the floor, weeping. The Dude and Walter look. The dog yaps. Quintana is bellowing from the lip of the lane, and is restrained by O'Brien. Walter looks at him innocently. He makes hip-grinding coital motions as O'Brien leads him away. Walter, his head cocked, and the Dude, peeking over his shades, watch him go. Donny, Walter, and the Dude emerge from the alley, each holding his leatherette ball satchel. The men in black, stunned, confer amongst themselves in German. The Germans stop conferring. Walter ignores the Dude, addresses the Germans. The Germans confer again, in German. Donny is visibly frightened. Walter's eyes, burning with hatred, are locked on Dieter's. The Dude is digging into his pocket. Louder, to the Germans, as he looks in his wallet. With a ring of steel, Dieter produces a glinting saber. He hurls his leather satchel. The bowling ball thuds into his chest and lifts him off his feet. In a rage, Dieter charges. Watching Dieter's charge, is caught off-guard. Dieter drops it. He twists away as Dieter reaches him; grabs Dieter's head in both hands; draws Dieter's head up to his mouth, which closes on Dieter's ear. He rushes Franz but draws up short as Franz sends out karate kicks, his leather pants squeaking and popping. His jaw is still clamped on Dieter's ear. Awkwardly circling, evading Franz's kicks. Still worrying the ear. With a tearing sound, his head and Dieter's separate. Growling as Dieter screams, he worries his ear, waggling his head with his jaws clamped. Franz gives a loud cry with each kick; the Dude leans back, throwing his arms up, evading the kicks. The Dude, also panting, rises and trots over. Donny gasps for air. The Dude runs into the lanes. Walter lays a reassuring hand on Donny's shoulder.",
    "964": "Harry gives a shrug of his head, as David's lips part, his gaze thoughtful. The young politician blinks his deep-set eyes and shifts his heartbroken gaze, his expression wistful, as he stares across the warehouse. David presses his lips together. Later, they follow a covered outdoor walkway and stop at a door, where Harry takes hold of a side door's knob. Passing through the door, they enter a spacious white gallery with paintings on the walls. The human obeys, agog. In an upper gallery, a partial dinosaur skeleton hangs from the ceiling. Peter, on an upper level overlooking the dinosaur, Harry leads David to another door, and David puts his hand on the agent's shoulder. Harry leads him into a service tunnel with pipework along the walls, and David obeys, gawking at the jarring change in location, and follows his guide down the damp corridor. They follow an enormous insulated pipe then descend a short flight of steps, as Harry crosses the floor and climbs a steep flight of steps to a rust-eaten door. Turning the knob counterclockwise, he opens it. They glimpse a stoic figure and a fedora passing by as he shuts the door behind him, and David gazes after him. Now Elise arrives at the Cedar Lake Dance Studio and faces a receptionist. Harry returns to the pumping station with a briefcase and leads David to a service junction where a cinderblock worktable awaits them. He takes two ledgers from the briefcase, handing one to David. As they confer, we watch Elise dance. Elsie drops warily onto her buttocks and lies down, resting her hands on her abdomen. Harry smiles to himself and sets his plan book down, while David stares at him. Pursing his lips, he shifts his gaze and gives a stoic nod. His lips pressed tight, Harry takes a deep breath and nods, as David regards impensively. Elise steps from the dance studio into the night air and makes her way down the sidewalk. At dawn, a thick blanket of lead gray clouds passes over the city. As we peer out the side of the Adjustment Bureau high rise, raindrops plummet at us, and rain soaks Harry's bench in Madison Square Park. Now at the courthouse, Adrian faces a petite clerk. Clad in a flowing black halter dress, Elise arrives with a friend and stares blankly. In the pumping station, Harry and David reach a spiral staircase. Harry smiles and gives David his fedora. Under the officer's kind gaze, David sets the fedora on his head and takes a controlled breath. As he climbs the spiral stairway, Harry gazes after him. David bursts out a door with a brief stumble and dashes down a rainy alleyway, sprinting across a busy street where cars narrowly avoid hitting him.",
    "596": "Waves crash against the pinnacle and the imposing coastline in front of them, the same craggy cliff as on Tom Riddle's postcard, with dark clouds scattered behind them, spray and spume washed over them. Dumbledore's hair and beard are buffeted by the strong wind, but his eyes are affixed on an inverted v-shaped fissure in the cliff face as Harry and Dumbledore are inside a rocky cavern. Dumbledore sharpens a knife against a rock and pierces his right hand with it. Harry looks at the wound as Dumbledore smears his bloodied hand across the rock face, which starts to crumble, and he steps back beside Harry and they both watch. Using their wands as torches, they enter a previously-hidden tunnel and approach a lake, looking out across the water with their wands reflected in the dark surface. Dumbledore sends a ball of light across the lake; it rises and falls over the surface of the water, then flares up, illuminating a tiny island in the distance. Dumbledore sets a foot on a half-submerged crystalline rock and stretches out his left hand over the water as the lake at his feet bubbles and churns. Something moves amidst the frothing waters, and a length of chain leaps up into Dumbledore's hands. He passes the end of the chain to Harry, who starts to pull on it as they watch the chain lift something out of the water, revealing the carved prow of a small boat rising in front of them. Harry tugs with greater vigor, hauling the boat towards them, and the boat slowly carries them across the still water towards the island. Reaching it, they scramble out onto the translucent rock where a dip in a rock pedestal forms a crystal basin filled with liquid. Dumbledore passes his hand over the shimmering surface, looks up with a start, uses a large shell as a cup, fills it with the liquid, and drinks. His eyes closed, he drains the shell, then opens his eyes and shudders, stepping back from the basin and sitting down with difficulty, covering his ear with his blackened right hand. Harry picks up the shell, steps over to the basin, scoops up more liquid, returns to Dumbledore, and helps him drink, filling the shell again, returning again and again, forcing the liquid into Dumbledore's mouth until the basin is almost empty. Dumbledore, his eyes half closed, presses his lips together, then reluctantly opens his mouth. He opens his mouth, Harry steps back, and Dumbledore raises his head and opens his eyes wide while Harry still holds the empty shell. Dumbledore smacks his lips, and Harry returns to the basin, picking up a locket and chain lying at the bottom, as he raises his wand.",
    "541": "By now, half the boat has been chopped up into matchwood, and the blades are getting closer; the wind of the blades is on their necks. Indy grabs Kazim just in time and jumps into the motorboat driven by Elsa, which gets alongside in the nick of time. Kazim pulls back his shirt to reveal a birthmark, or is it a tattoo? Whatever it is, it's a cruciform sword, a Christian cross that tapers down like the blades of a broadsword. The boat is close to the edge of the canal as Kazim steps ashore and walks away. Close on the water-soaked paper impression: the rubbing taken from the shield of the Grail Knight. Brody is giving it careful study while he dabs the lump on the back of his head with an ice pack. Indy, wearing a bathrobe, leans over to study the impression. Brody lowers the ice pack from his head and looks at Indy, picks up the Grail Diary which covers two pages of the Diary, and Brody's finger moves across it. Indy closes the Grail Diary and puts it into the pocket of his robe, opens the door, and finds his bedroom has been ransacked, with the mattress on the floor, the drawers turned out. Indy approaches another door (Elsa's bedroom) and knocks. He goes in and finds that Elsa's bedroom is in a similar ransacked state to his own. He is worried for her, knocks and calls out, steps into the room, and knocks upon the bathroom door. He opens the bathroom door, peering inside, where Elsa is standing before a mirror, wearing a silk bathrobe. She gasps, startled, as Indy enters, and he retreats back into her bedroom as she reaches up to turn off a record player sitting on a ledge above the bathtub. Elsa joins Indy, waiting in the ransacked room, looking around in shock. She looks to Indy, who pulls the Grail Diary from his pocket. She comes closer to him, stomps her foot angrily, and starts to walk away, but Indy grabs her. He pulls her to him and kisses her. Now Elsa reaches for Indy and kisses him, and he embraces her, and Elsa begins to nibble at his ear. Indy smiles slyly as they fall to the bed. A gondolier sings as he steers his gondola carrying two passengers past Indy's window. Indy lies on top of Elsa, kissing her. He stops for a moment as he hears the gondolier singing. Elsa reaches up and pulls him back down to her. A Mercedes-Benz glides through the sharp mountain curves, superimposed over a map that charts their course from Venice across Austria toward Salzburg as storm clouds darken the skies.",
    "953": "At 12:02 PM, Joe sits in his bedroom painting a model monster. Joe and his friends have gathered on a grassy bank, and the yellow Coupe that had pulled up outside the house for the wake draws up, driven by a teenage blonde girl, Alice. Jack looks slightly disoriented by Joe's reply and considers how to respond, while Joe gives Jack a cool, unconvinced look before returning his attention to the pamphlet featuring pictures of boys having a fantastic time playing baseball. Jack notices Joe holding a locket in his left hand. Alice turns away moodily and shakes her head, glaring at him and considering. Joe grins and offers Alice a candy, delighted when she takes it. She glances at him in the rearview mirror, causing his smile to slip. The car pulls up outside an isolated railway station, and the kids get out. Joe does Alice's makeup, gently sponging it on. She ties her hair back from her face, and Joe continues applying the makeup. He stops and stares at her, uncertain of how to respond when she dabs makeup onto her eyelids. Cary's fireworks go off, and Alice's eyes fill with un-shed tears, spellbinding Joe with her performance. Playing the detective, Martin stares at Alice, who slips out of character, causing Martin to wipe a tear. Charles runs across the station platform and looks at an approaching train while the boys break into a panic and scramble. The camera is loaded and, as the train approaches, they prepare to film. Joe and Preston smile until Joe sees a pickup pull onto the tracks ahead of the train. The vehicles collide, knocking the camera over as the freight train barrels through the station and derails. Alice stares at it as the tracks careen through the station building, smashing it to matchwood. Electrical explosions go off around the station, sending trucks hurtling through the air. The kids flee through the debris as explosions mushroom around them, with more trucks and carriages colliding. A tanker is thrown through the air and explodes upon hitting the ground. Joe runs past the flaming debris, a piece of which is flung into the air, but he sees a warning sign on it before a massive explosion erupts, throwing him to the ground. He looks up, gets to his feet, and looks at a carriage lying on its side, which is then racked by a series of explosions. Joe clasps the locket tightly in his left hand as he watches an explosion toss a chunk of the carriage high into the air.",
    "975": "Colored buttons fall into a large heap, forming the Warner Brothers' shield, and more buttons continue to fall. A gaunt, ashen-faced, old woman's sunken eyes flicker open wearily, then close. The woman, Daisy, lies in a hospital bed wearing a tight turban as 30-something Caroline goes to her bedside and clasps her hand. Daisy was scratching her chest, and a nurse rounds the bed to Daisy's IV drip, adjusting it as Daisy closes her eyes again. Dark-haired Caroline looks away pensively, then gently takes Daisy's hand in her own, hugs her, sits up, and strokes her mother's arm. Daisy's eyes open slightly and her brow furrows. A flashback reveals an enormous station with a grand colonnade and a watch smith's where Caroline listens intently. The watch smith wears dark glasses, is bald, and has a mustache. They see their son off at the station as Mrs. Gateau opens a letter at the dining table, looks across at her husband, who wipes his mouth and leaves the table. They stand on a platform as uniformed men unload a line of coffins from a steam train and then leave the grave. He fits a large brass cog as a crowd of spectators gathers on the spacious concourse of the train station, staring expectantly at Mr. Gateau, who stands atop a raised, wooden scaffold platform and unveils a huge, embossed, brass, wall-mounted clock with its long second hand starting to turn backwards. In reverse action, a fallen soldier stands and runs backward from an explosion as bespectacled President Roosevelt removes his trilby, watching soldiers run backward over mud. Their son climbs down from the train on which he departed as it reverses into the station while, on the concourse, the President hangs his head and then looks up again. Grainy footage shows Mr. Gateau rowing out to sea in a wooden boat. The nurse rises from her seat in the corner of the room and walks out past an empty neighboring bed, as pale Caroline stares off in thought, closes her eyes, goes to the sofa, and uncovers Daisy's suitcase, revealing a leather-bound book. Caroline sits with a book that contains a black-and-white wedding photo. Fireworks illuminate the streets filled with revelers waving American flags as 40-something Thomas Button sprints through the crowd and makes a beeline for a house on the corner, his trilby blowing off as he races to the front steps and lets himself in. A maid in the hallway closes the door as Thomas hurries to an upstairs bedroom to find his wife lying in a large bed under blood-stained sheets. Thomas removes his coat as a doctor approaches him, then turns to see a priest. Thomas strides to his wife's bedside and nods as the priest gives the last rites, and Thomas walks cautiously towards the baby's cot.",
    "436": "The attendant holds out a towel, and Don wipes his hands. He looks at Don’s lapel, mystified. Don tips the attendant with a fifty-cent piece. The attendant doesn’t get the joke but chuckles automatically and opens the door into the bar. Don walks from the washroom, slowly toward his table. Suddenly he stops and looks around. They are staring at Don. Near the little piano stand Don’s waiter, the head waiter, the piano player, and the lovers. In fact, he’s suddenly aware that he is the focus of every eye in the room. M. M.'s escort is right at him, grabbing him by the coat. He takes the bag out from under his coat and hands it to the lady. M. M.'s escort snatches it from his hand. Don holds out the bill and fishes what money he has left from his pocket. The waiter snaps it up. By this time, they’ve got Don to the door. The headwaiter gets Don’s hat from the checkroom girl’s hand, puts it on Don’s head, and the bouncer pulls him through the door. The bouncer, dragging Don from Harry's and Joe's, gives him one last shove down the street. Don comes to a stop and leans heavily against an iron railing, wiping his face with his hand. He straightens his hat, looks back. The doorman and the taxi drivers are staring after him. Don turns, straightens himself as best he can, and starts for home, shame weighing down every limb. There is a line of waiting taxis along the brilliantly lighted nightclub street. It is meanly lighted by the wall brackets. The newspaper, the bottle of milk, and Helen’s note are all as they were. Don drags himself up the last few steps, unlocks the door, and goes in, leaving the paper, bottle, and note untouched. Don has entered. Automatically he switches on the light in the corridor. In a stupor of shame and misery, he stumbles over to the living room couch, flings himself down on it, and lies covering his face with his arms. After a time, he brushes the tears from his eyes with his sleeve and, as he does so, catches sight of something which rivets his attention and brings a half-crazed smile to his lips. On the ceiling is the shadow of the bottle which he hid in the light fixture. With new strength, Don gets to his feet, nervous laughter shaking him. He pulls the coffee table under the light fixture, puts the chair on it, climbs up, and retrieves his bottle. He climbs down again, opening the bottle fiercely. Don opens his eyes slowly. Don gets up, steadying himself on the bedpost and holding the door frame, he slowly moves out of the bedroom.",
    "1207": "By its red glow, the mercenaries check their watches en masse. Lewis pulls a hood over his head. The team, including Rambo, make ready. His head covered by a black hat, School Boy stealthily climbs the wooden steps of the camp watch tower. He pulls out a vicious-looking knife with a serrated blade from a sheath. A guard in a rain poncho smokes a cigarette and sees the headlamps of the truck in the distance. He walks into the rain-soaked road as the truck approaches the camp. BN is at the wheel, dressed as a soldier. School Boy steals onto the watch tower platform where a lookout sits in a chair, oblivious to his presence. On the tower, School Boy clamps a hand over the guard's mouth and plunges the serrated blade into the soldier. He rests his rifle on the timbers of the watch tower. In the truck, Rambo's eye-line and bandana are reflected in BN's driving mirror. BN wears a frown of concentration as the camp nears the camp guard post. The guard waves them through, a cigarette ember glowing between his fingers. On the tower, School Boy checks his watch, nine minutes to two. In the still-moving truck, Rambo signals to Reese. Reese jumps off the truck, rolls, and hides. En-Joo jumps off, rounds the corner of a hut with his weapon raised, and takes cover. Rambo clamps Lewis on the shoulder and the hooded man jumps off, taking cover between the two huts. The troops enjoy the exotic dance show. Diaz leaps from the truck and rolls uncomfortably. As the truck passes over a low wooden bridge above a stream, Rambo jumps off, rolls in the mud, and takes position at the side of a hut. He looks through the wooden slats at the hut wall. A figure is inscribing a tattoo on another's back with black ink. Rambo hurries away. At the dance show, some of the watching soldiers rock drunkenly back and forth in time with the music. BN brings the truck to a halt and gets out of the cab. He pauses near the truck's bonnet. The dancing women are peasants. Their eyes are dull and uninterested. En-Joo nears a hut and peers inside. Someone sits in front of a nude female, his hands on her waist. En-Joo moves on. Reese approaches a hut and checks inside in the same way. Rambo checks the luminous dial of his analog watch, seven minutes to two. A man hangs crucified on a timber frame. Above him, the caged volunteers are blindfolded. One of the prisoners hears his approach. Pigs are tearing flesh from the crucified man's leg. Rambo draws his homemade machete and runs up to the cage.",
    "681": "The gum-chewing, bored-looking receptionist looks at the clock: three minutes past two. His face unflinching, Peter unties the two fasteners keeping the pizzas together, one after the other. He glances up at the receptionist, then walks back towards the janitor's cupboard he emerged from. The receptionist eyes Peter suspiciously as he turns to the elevators he just walked past. He presses a button, the doors open, and he steps into an elevator. He presses another button, gives the receptionist a friendly smile and a wave, and the doors close. Back at Joe's Pizza, with Mister Aziz, Mister Aziz stares at the eager, bright-eyed youth, steps up to him, and reaches for Peter's helmet. He rips the Joe's Pizza sticker from it. Later, at the Bugle, he hands over the chitty, and Miss Brant chucks Peter's chin and strolls away. Peter smiles self-consciously. The opposing columnated University building, pathways in front of it, Peter runs through the campus and collides with a student. He bends to pick up his book. One student stands on his books, the bags of others hit Peter. He rises as Doctor Connors takes a few paces past Peter, stops, then turns. The brow of the thin-faced Doctor Connors furrows as he walks away, the right sleeve of his coat is empty. Night, Peter on his moped, moves into the garden of a wooden, suburban hedge, he enters the house, takes off his helmet, satchel and jacket, and stares at Harry Osborn. Harry watches MJ go. Harry frowns at Peter, who stares back flatly. When Peter doesn't respond, Harry rises and walks away, stands, hands on hips, and looks at a framed photograph of his father with Peter. Peter puts his hand on Harry's shoulder. The lights go out, and Peter blows out the candles on his birthday cake. Later that night, Aunt May is asleep at the table, letters and papers by her. He walks around the table and takes hold of his aunt's hand. Aunt May reaches into her purse. Tears well in Peter's eyes. Aunt May kisses Peter on the cheek and walks away. Peter struggles to fight back the tears, takes the litter out into the backyard in a plastic bin bag, and strides to the bottom of the garden, not noticing MJ sitting on the steps of the house next door. MJ walks towards him. Peter gazes at her. She moves closer to him, leaning over the fence. He shakes his head, his eyes flitting from hers to her mouth. The two of them stand as if transfixed. Peter starts to speak. MJ stares at him expectantly. Again, he shakes his head and lowers his eyes. She keeps hers fixed on him. He looks up again and tries to smile.",
    "807": "The cars drive around the pair and stop, creating a cloud of dust that hangs in the air. Marwan, Hani, and the rest of the men get out of their cars, and Hani gestures for Marwan to open the door for Ferris to get out. Ferris watches Hani walk up to the kneeling figure and take off the hood, then dial a cell phone. Karami takes the phone, and Hani goes to Ferris. Karami hangs up, and Hani takes the phone back while Karami stares up at him. Karami stands, and Hani kisses his cheeks. One of the men gives Karami a bicycle, and he leaves. Hani strolls over to Ferris, who nods thoughtfully. Later, Ferris, walking back to his apartment, is on the phone and sees someone in his apartment. Two SUVs drive through gates and stop in front of the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate, where Ferris and Hoffman get out of the vehicles and head along corridors to join Hani in the meeting room. Hoffman smiles tightly, sits, and puts a photograph on the table, staring at Hani, who glances at Ferris. In the SUV, Hoffman smokes a fat cigar and has a drink with Ferris on the balcony of his apartment, while kids play football on the patch of ground in front of the safe house. Skip stands amidst the market as Karami, dressed in dark trousers, a pale cream shirt, waistcoat, and skullcap, emerges from a doorway and walks through the market. Seeing him, Skip talks into an earpiece. Wearing shades, Karami walks purposefully through the marketplace with Skip following him. Karami takes off his shades and reads a newspaper as he walks down a narrow street with Skip on his tail. Further down the street, a van is reversing. Karami slows up, glances down at his paper, and looks round at Skip, who throws out his hands. Karami darts between the van and a building, running down side streets as the van blocks Skip's way. Two men jump out, and Skip bangs on the door before the van moves forward. Skip squeezes through the gap and runs down the street, but Karami is gone. Ferris sits on the bed in a treatment room at the health clinic when Aisha the nurse walks in, jabs a needle in his stomach, and walks out. He follows her, passing densely packed concrete buildings with ramshackle flat roofs. Hordes of people swarm on the street, where traders sell produce from barrows. Ferris walks along the street with Aisha, who wears a headscarf, and they are photographed. At a clinic, Ferris sits in a waiting room with a group of women and children; some women look at him curiously and smile. Emerging from her room, Aisha smiles at Ferris.",
    "842": "The redhead grabs Sandy's suitcase and unzips it, discovering some clothes and a toiletry bag. Outside, a blue and yellow taxi arrives, and Sandy exits the back holding the pink slip. A huge sweat stain runs down the front of his shirt as he pays the driver and eyes the house before proceeding in a stealthy jog along the side, with an even larger sweat stain covering his back. Looking around, he cautiously enters the back gate and, through a window, spots the redhead rummaging through his toiletries, aggressively rubbing his deodorant onto her armpits as he creeps into the room. He pulls out handcuffs, and she complies, but then she punches his throat. He grabs her leg, knocking her down, and she grabs and slaps his face. Standing, she backs him into the counter and throws him over a chair. As she bolts, Sandy hurls a small appliance and whacks her with a guitar. A bunch of IDs are scattered as two thugs stand at the door and a gunshot blasts off the door knob. Sandy and Diana bolt as the woman bursts in with her male partner wielding a short gun. Diana pierces two of their tires with a knife and hurries into Sandy's car. Sandy reverses over her mailbox and into the neighbor's yard, knocking over a sign as he cuffs their hands together. The female thug rips the knife from the tire as Sandy speeds off. She picks the lock, frees herself, and reaches into her shirt as Sandy pulls over. She hitchhikes, and Diana glares and bolts, but Sandy easily catches up to the overweight woman. Diana snatches his keys and runs, slowly running and flashing her middle finger. Sandy jogs in front of her as Diana stumbles to a stop, and he rolls his eyes and crosses his fingers. Diana stares in his eyes, then limps toward the car as Sandy follows her. Sandy retrieves the keys from the middle of the highway and hurries back to the car. In an auto garage, a muscular tattooed mechanic works as the female thug watches him nearby and lifts her phone. Meanwhile, an aging man sits in a jail cell, and Julian furrows his brow as the prisoner pays the guard. In Sandy's car, Diana, with her lips pursed, faces him with wide eyes and dances in her seat, while Sandy changes the station and glares as she mimes playing instruments. They speed over a bridge spanning a small river. Elsewhere, a roughneck man with weathered skin and a gray goatee approaches a van. In his brand new van, the aging man arrives at the strip mall, stops outside the salon, and peers inside. Entering, he finds a young brunette stylist sweeping the floor, and the stylist nods and smiles as he eyes the salon.",
    "1275": "The snake locks begin to move, and the heavy, circular, stone door of the Chamber of Secrets swings open. Meanwhile, the protective shield and the burning wooden ground stones at the Quidditch Pitch illuminate the dark hillside, as illusions continue to pound against the shield. Neville stands on a covered wooden bridge, looking out across the landscape, and he sees an army of Snatchers, led by Scabior, racing towards the school. Neville recoils as two Snatchers run ahead, hit the shield, and disintegrate, while Scabior steadies his men and stares at Neville, who is guarding the entrance up ahead. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron approaches the skeleton of the Basilisk and wrenches a fang from its jaw. Hermione takes the two-handled gold cup from her bottomless bag, and Ron hands her the fang. He kneels down and places the golden cup on the ground between them. Hermione sinks to her knees, hesitating as she stares at the cup. Harry budges his way through students, as Ron raises his eyes to Hermione. She draws back her arm and plunges the fang into the cup. Voldemort roars as the cup spins across the floor, and Harry gasps and reels back as water bursts into the chamber, prompting Hermione and Ron to run from it. Immediately, the Dark Lord appears in the swelling torrent and breathes deeply, while gasping, Harry leans back against a pillar. Ron and Hermione, with the receding waters behind them, turn to each other and kiss hungrily, standing as if on a bridge with the waters on either side, before they break apart. On the outcrop, Voldemort, with Nagini coiled beside him, unleashes a powerful blast of light toward the shield from the Elder Wand. Professor McGonagall and Ginny stare upwards as parts of the shield start to burn. Remus reaches out to Nymphadora, and their fingers almost touch. Holding the Elder Wand, Voldemort suddenly recoils and looks down as energy crackles through the nut-nutted wand. He gazes at the smoldering shield, which now resembles a burning dome of flame. Harry seems to regain his strength and moves with determination through the fleeing students as the disintegrating shield fills the skies with burning debris. Scabior catches one of the flaming embers on the tip of his wand, open-mouthed, and scowls at Neville, who remains on guard on the wooden bridge. Scabior takes a very slow and tentative step forward, grins, and Neville backs away while the Snatchers race behind Scabior and make for the bridge. They haul fireballs at Neville, who dodges them, and a spell from Neville's wand ignites charges in the joints of the bridge supports, causing them to start to explode. As Scabior runs faster, the bridge collapses behind him while Ginny and the others watch as Neville sprints towards them, and a huge explosion rips the bridge apart.",
    "93": "His features are broad, friendly, Asian-American. A waitress meets them at the table. Again she glances about. He is sliding out of his side of the booth and easing in next to Marge. Marge clinks it. The reverse shows a disappearing waiter and the backs of many, many people sitting at tables between us and the very distant stage. Jose Feliciano, very small, performs on a spotlit stool. The acoustics are poor. Carl grimaces. Carl is humping the escort. The escort is grabbed and flung out of bed. Shep slaps him hard, forehand, backhand. He hauls him up. After hitting him several times, Shep yanks Carl's belt out of his dangling pants and strangles him with it. Carl gurgles. Shep knees Carl repeatedly, then dumps him onto the floor and starts whipping him with the buckle end of the belt. His face is deeply bruised and cut. Finally, through the phone, Jerry is at the kitchen phone. Through the door to the dining room we see Wade picking up an extension. The line goes dead. A door slams off-screen. Wade, briefcase in hand, gets into his Cadillac, slams the door and peels out. Thunk! - his first boot goes on. He mumbles to himself as he drives. He pulls out a gun and fires into Wade's gut. Jerry pulls to a halt next to Wade's idling Cadillac. Jerry approaches in the Cadillac. The wooden gate barring the exit has been broken away. The booth is empty. Jerry eases toward the street, looking over at the booth as he passes. Inside the booth we see the awkwardly angled leg of a prostrate body. The car pulls into the driveway. Jerry enters and sits on the foyer chair to take off his galoshes. In his car, now parked, one hand holding the rag pressed to his mangled jaw. He is staring down at something in the front seat next to him. It has money inside - a lot of money. Carl unfreezes, takes out one of the bank-wrapped wads and looks at it. Marge drives, gazing out at the road. She leans out of her open window and yells at the order panel. She sits in the lot, eating a breakfast sandwich. Jerry is at his desk using a blunt pencil to enter numbers onto a form. Beneath the form is a piece of carbon paper and beneath that another form copy, which Jerry periodically checks. The carbon-copy form shows thick smudgy, illegible entries. She starts to enter. Jerry looks up and freezes, mouth hanging open, brow knit with worry. But she is already sitting into the chair opposite with a sigh of relieved weight. There is a silent beat. He trails off into silence.",
    "1364": "Mike sighs, deciding to level with her, and just then, the waitress walks up. He stands up, and Abby looks out at the dance floor, seeing that even the worst dancers are great. Mike grabs her hand and leads her onto the dance floor, and they make their way onto the crowded dance floor. They give a longer kiss, and Mike starts out of the elevator, then returns, grabbing Abby, and suddenly, they're all over each other. In the midst of this, the elevators try to close, but their furious groping blocks it, until a shrill buzzing begins. They abruptly step apart, staring at each other, and Mike backs out of the elevator, looking shell-shocked as the doors close. Abby is flushed and stunned, then sinks down onto her bed, wearing the same expression. She leaps up, smooths her hair, checks her reflection, and goes to the door, opening it with a smile to find Colin standing there, bottle of red wine in hand. He walks in the room, holding up the wine, while Mike approaches Abby's door. Mike reels, trying to cover his shock as Abby appears behind Colin. He turns and goes, with Mike walking down the hall, freaked out and perturbed, as Abby runs to catch up with him. He keeps walking as she tries to keep up, then stops and looks at her. They hold eye contact for a very long moment before Mike looks away, shrugs, and walks off. Abby enters the room where Colin stands shirtless, and she takes the glass and drinks, and keeps drinking. Abby finishes the glass and looks at him, smiles, pleased, then he continues, but her smile fades. Abby looks at him, nodding, then she looks around, feeling hurt and stunned, but overcomes it with fierce and abiding hatred. Abby and Joy walk through the waiting area, which is filled with Mike Alexander replacement hopefuls of all different shapes and sizes, and Abby points at candidates while Joy makes notes on a clipboard, looking a little worried. Stuart sits in the control room next to Cliff as Jack Magnum does his intro, now standing in a balloon basket. Mike looks over to see live footage from the Balloon Fiesta on TV as Jack Magnum continues to alienate his audience. Jack Magnum is tackled and pushed out of the balloon basket, and after a moment, a frazzled Abby pops up in his place. Stuart and Cliff watch from the control room in shock, and Stuart picks up, then blanches. Abby stands in the basket, still nervous but flying on adrenaline, and Mike stares at Abby on TV for a second, then grabs his keys and races out as Jonah calls after him.",
    "752": "A high door swings open, and a caped figure stands in the entrance of a warehouse. He looks around as silver-grey light from the rows of small windows glows on strange objects. To his left, beyond a set of stairs, two looming shapes appear and become recognizable as the ends of two train carriages, slightly bent and twisted. The man walks to the nearer of the two, not badly damaged at the back. As he looks up at the length of it, however, he sees that the sides have been smashed open. The little remaining glass is cracked and shattered, and seats lean drunkenly, having been torn from their mountings, their upholstery charred and blackened. Light catches the man's face as he stares up at the wrecked carriage. He stands quite still, looking up, grim-faced, for a long time, ignoring drops of water falling from his hood. In the dark, a man is crouching on a force. He rises onto his knees. As his head comes up, light falls on the face of David, aged about 20. He looks around, and the light is coming from a burning car, upside down behind him. He staggers towards it, stumbling on his knees, crawling. A young woman lies in the burning car, unconscious. Audrey is lying very still. David grasps the edge of the car door with both hands and pulls. He bends down and checks the door catch, which doesn't move. Audrey's arm is hanging out of the window. David grabs the edge of the door again and heaves. Beyond him, flames rise up into the night sky. He rips the door from its hinges, bends down, and releases Audrey's seat belt. David drags Audrey from the car, cradles her in his arms, and lays her down gently some yards away. He looks over his shoulder and sees the lights of a pickup truck coming slowly around the bend. He waves frantically. When he looks back, Audrey's eyes are open. He holds her head, tenderly. The truck driver runs to them. David looks into the man's concerned face, and back at Audrey. Very slowly, he lifts his head, the flames still flickering behind him. He has a thoughtful expression on his face and doesn't meet the man's eyes. Elijah rolls his wheelchair along a darkened corridor, his right leg still sticking straight out with its two long rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it. He picks up the phone. Elijah looks straight ahead, past the rows of shelving, displaying a huge collection of comics. David is standing at the top of the stairs above the concourse of Philadelphia Train Station. On either side of him, tall classical stone pillars.",
    "1016": "Mike is hiding in the bushes as she turns to go, and Colin grabs her arm, pulls her close, and gives her a lingering kiss while Mike stares, open-mouthed. Colin smiles at Abby, and they go to their apartments, which are opposite each other. Abby waves a giant foam hand that she picked up at the game as Colin goes into his apartment. Abby runs along the path to Mike and gives him a hug, then runs joyfully to her apartment as Mike walks off. On the show, he is wearing a gorilla suit, and a video screen behind Larry and Georgia shows monkeys having sex while Abby and Joy watch a monitor. Mike’s nephew, Joe, is present, and the gorilla suit is mentioned. Abby jumps up and down, grinning, as she steps out of her apartment. On the doormat is a gift bag, which Abby picks up and looks around, frowning. She takes an envelope out of the gift bag and goes back inside, opening the card and taking a box from the gift bag. Inside the box is a pair of remote-controlled, vibrating briefs. Abby stands in front of the mirror, applies lipstick, perches on the arm of a chair, sips a glass of white wine, and glances at the vibrating briefs, considering for a moment. She reaches under her white dress, pulls down her briefs, and as she does so, D'Artagnan the cat trots past and climbs onto a chair. Abby picks up the black, lacy vibrating briefs and puts them on, pulls up the briefs, and straightens out her dress while D'Artagnan the cat stares at her. She picks up the small, cylindrical remote control unit, puts her briefs and the box for the vibrating briefs behind a cushion, stuffs the remote control in her handbag, and opens the door. Mike and Stuart are there, and she smiles bitterly. In Stuart's car, executives are gathered in a restaurant, and Mike puts his arms around the bikini babes as they sit around a table with the executives. Abby kicks Mike, knocking over her bag and causing the remote control to fall out. A kid finds the remote control unit for the vibrating briefs on the floor and picks it up, switching it on and causing Abby to squirm. Abby and Mike look under the table as the boy shakes it, making Abby stiffen. Abby squirms, crosses her legs, and points at her feet. Mike sees the boy with the remote and she glares at him while he winks. Mike grabs the remote from the boy, and Abby grabs it back. They lean on a railing, glance at the rest of the group, and Mike's gaze is fixed on Abby and Colin as they go. Stuart comes over, and a country road lined with lush, green trees, dappled with sunlight, is seen.",
    "688": "Peter is at a bank where Aunt May kicks the bank clerk and holds up a newspaper cutting, studying it, while the bank clerk smiles, stands, and limps away. On the other side of the banking hall, Octavius, wearing a long coat and a triveil, is standing in front of the steel vault door and tosses it across the hall, leaving Aunt May's mouth hanging open as Peter runs off around the corner. Octavius uses his mechanical limbs to bypass the guards, with one pincer bending around to take off his hat, then starts picking up bulging sacks of money from the vault and stuffing them into yellow bags. One of the pincers detects something, prompting Octavius to glance around as Spider-Man flies in. Octavius throws bags at Spider-Man, who swings up to the ceiling, catching a bag in a web and hitting Octavius, who spins around and tosses more. Spider-Man lands on a wall without his web, and a bag of coins hits him. A gold coin rolls over to the bank clerk, who is about to pocket it when Aunt May smacks him. Octavius' metal limbs pick Spider-Man up, with the other two pincers grabbing his head and starting to squeeze; Spider-Man fires a web and raises his arms at the desk and display case, causing the limbs to smash the desk. The display case hits Octavius and propels him out of the bank onto a yellow cab, where he gets to his feet and the limbs approach Spider-Man, hurling him back into the bank. Two police cars screech to a halt, and one of the mechanical limbs grabs Aunt May as cover. Octavius lumbers off with Aunt May. Inside an office, a girl on the phone lays down the receiver and crosses to the window as a limb pokes through the wall, with Octavius hammering up the outside of the office building, three limbs doing the work, the fourth holding Aunt May. Spider-Man appears above him, and high up the building, Octavius drops Aunt May, but a web from Spider-Man catches her, and she springs back up. Below her, Octavius crashes Spider-Man against the building, but Spider-Man still has a battle on his hands. He punches free of Octavius and scoots up the building, only to be grabbed by one of the mechanical limbs. Aunt May sees Spider-Man hauled down by Octavius, and the two men trade blows and spring off the building, falling towards the ground with one of the limbs securing a hold.",
    "754": "David follows the man as he pushes his wheelie bin around a corner and along a dimly lit corridor. A couple of people are lounging listlessly against the wall. David stands gazing at the door, seeing shadows of people passing back and forth inside through frosted glass panels. The door opens and the maintenance man reappears, wearing a cap and with a bag slung across his body. The man walks at a steady pace along a dark street lined with cars, and up a long stairway lit by tall bright lamps on alternate sides. David follows him with the hood of his cape up against the teeming rain. At the top of the stairs, he waits and watches. The man continues up a street on a gentle incline, where large houses are set back from the road, and turns and walks up the path to a detached house with a mature tree in the front garden. He stops in the porch, looks up and down the street, takes something from beside the porch, and disappears into the shadows around the side of the house. David drops his head, staring down at the ground. The shadow from his hood obscures all his face but a triangle from his nose to his mouth. He lifts his head and looks towards the house. Two strips of light appear and very slowly widen as a door opens. The spreading light falls on mail scattered over a tiled floor, and on clothes strewn on the floor further inside. Water drips from a cape onto a pair of shoes. David stands silhouetted in the doorway. Lights are on inside the house. Beyond three open doorways, David can see a staircase. He stops in the doorway, and slowly turns back. He takes a step back into a dark lobby, looking to his left, and reaches forward to open another door. He looks around and switches on a light. The house owner is lying head down on the basement steps, and David sees again the maintenance man's violent entry into the house. David closes the door and moves slowly into the next room, which has half paneled walls. He passes a chair at the end of a table, which suggests it's the dining room. The next room has easy chairs, a sitting room. Light from a television flickers and he glances towards it. He stops before moving into the hallway. David's shadow grows larger on the wall at the top of the stairs as he climbs them. He peers through the crack of a partly open door. Frowning, he steps forward and pushes it open wider, and flicks on the light. He steps into a child's bedroom with pop posters on the wall.",
    "941": "Irene turns her head and faces him, swallows deeply, and then he turns away from her. Irene gets to her feet, staggers away, leaning on other tables as she passes them, while he coolly sips his tea and stares ahead icily. Holmes sits in the Savoy's restaurant with his back to the entrance and turns on hearing a woman's laugh, furrowing his brow. He checks his watch, which rests on the table, noting it's eight minutes past nine. His left eye is bruised, and he is cleaned up but isn't clean-shaven. He glances around and tucks his napkin down the front of his shirt as pages turn. The title appears over a black-and-white illustration, which becomes a skyline of London with terraced houses, chimney pots, and slate tile. Underground-railway construction work is carried out on Baker Street. Dr. John Watson, the man seated at the typewriter, limps along the pavement with a cane in his right hand and holds the lead for a bulldog in his left. He has a hand-knitted scarf draped around his neck, opens the front door, and he and the dog enter the house. He bends to unfasten the lead, and the dog scampers upstairs. Watson opens the door and is immediately assailed by the fronds of a palm tree, grins, and walks in. The room is filled with tropical plants, and he spots a turkey and sees a motionless Holmes by the window. A dart hits Watson in the shoulder; he turns and sees a goat, then sits by the mannequin of Holmes. Another dart lands as Holmes is revealed to be wearing a two-colored garment and a brown hood that melds perfectly with the furniture. He pulls off the hood, and Watson glowers at him. Holmes leans over Watson and unveils four mice before leaving, with her stepping forward as Holmes disappears behind closed curtains. Watson opens the curtains and looks into his old office, seeing one wall filled with a map of the world, newspaper articles, and photographs, with lines of red ribbon covering the wall. The man in the restaurant drinks his brandy while Holmes drinks his formaldehyde, and Gladstone keels over while the dog jumps up and runs off. He has a false beard as they ride in an early car, attracting stares from people as it goes by. Holmes removes his enormous false beard and stares at Watson as they pull up. Watson shakes his head, gets out, and Holmes follows, with Watson kicking one of the car's tires to shaking hands. In a nightclub, two girls swing upside down from a trapeze as men throng the club, chatting and drinking. Holmes and Watson sit at a table, where a waitress and a waiter spread a tablecloth for them. Holmes downs his drink, and Watson grabs the cigar from Holmes' mouth and marches off.",

A wire birdcage hangs close to the shade, silhouetted with a canary on the perch. The CHILDREN enter, backs to us, and stop, looking with window light on their faces as the song ends. He vanishes beyond the trees, his singing growing more distant, and then wakes her. He vanishes again as children scuttle in hay and dogs quiet while his song dies. Hand in hand, they hurry out of the barn and, as we pan, along its side towards the river. JOHN steers through turbulent, moonlit water beneath a low moon. On blank, calm water, the skiff enters, passing full length below us with the children asleep in it, as blank water returns and the fox barks again. The skiff nears a sand-bar and the prow softly grates against the sand. Tilting upward, distant sounds include medium and near roosters crowing o.s. He looks to PEARL, who is picking daisies. Beyond the fence, a woman, RACHEL COOPER, appears carrying a berry-basket on her arm. JOHN scrambles up, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively while PEARL freezes. They hesitate and still hesitate as RACHEL breaks off a switch and comes for them, squishing through the mud. She surrounds them and drives them like geese up the bank as they move across the meadow like a nursery frieze with her tweaking with her switch. As she goes near PEARL's calves, JOHN turns to see three crouching figures picking tomatoes beyond a low white fence with Rachel's house in the background. RUBY, thirteen, pops her head up like a rifle-target, followed by Clary, eleven, and Mary, four. She has JOHN and PEARL by their napes while the three girls enter, their backs to us, carrying baskets of tomatoes. She holds JOHN and PEARL very firmly, inspecting baskets across the gate of the fence. She opens the gate, pushes the Harper children through, shuts the gate, and walks between them, her back to us. The children hesitate as she turns to them and stops, looking them up and down. If we saw her face, her lips would be pursed and working with anger. His eyes go down to her feet, and he, and we, start to examine her from foot to head, as this is our heroine at last from JOHN’S eye-level, tilting slowly up her height. She wears man's shoes, heavy with mud, a rough skirt, and a shapeless sweater hanging over her shoulders; she is in her middle sixties and wears a man's old hat. Her face says, for no reason at all, he feels he has come home. RACHEL mercilessly scrubs JOHN, who doesn't like it, while RUBY washes PEARL with a cloth, both hating the scrubbing. JOHN breaks away and dodges behind a bush with RACHEL in hot pursuit.",
    "320": "He smiles at Frodo as Frodo sits up, looking at Gandalf questioningly, troubled, and his eyes drift away. Saruman stands over Gandalf, gloating. With the power of his staff, Saruman raises Gandalf from the ground, then sends him crashing to the floor. Suddenly, Gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower. Saruman watches Gandalf fly away from Isengard on the back of a giant eagle. Gwaihir the Eagle soars majestically over the mountains, carrying Gandalf towards the dawn. Frodo raises himself up and looks at Gandalf as Sam runs to Frodo's bedside, overjoyed to find Frodo awake. Sam looks past Frodo smiling at a bent figure sitting alone on a bench in the sun. Frodo turns, following Sam's gaze to Bilbo Baggins, breaking into a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him. Bilbo has aged significantly since last seen. Frodo turns the neatly inscribed title page of a red leather bound journal, looking at page after page of beautiful handwriting, with intricate maps and drawings. He is sitting with Frodo on a terrace overlooking a waterfall. Frodo turns a page and finds a map of the Shire, as Bilbo smiles proudly. Sam busily tries to stuff more things into his already full pack, pots and pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, clothes, and then looks up, startled. Gandalf and Elrond watch Frodo and Sam from Elrond's balcony before Elrond turns and walks away and Gandalf turns to look out the window. With the broken sword, Isildur slices off Sauron's finger as Elrond reacts and Isildur turns and walks away. Strider watches from the shadows as Boromir strolls through the darkened gallery, his eyes drawn to an old fresco on the wall depicting Isildur defeating Sauron. Boromir looks with wonderment at Narsil, the broken blade of Elendil, lying on a cloth-covered plinth, and sensing Strider's presence, looks from the blade to Strider, as if sensing a connection. Night falls upon the beautiful valley of Rivendell, still and quiet, as Strider and Arwen stand upon a stone bridge, the Evenstar at Arwen's breast shining in the moonlight. Arwen looks into Strider's eyes, closes Strider's fingers around the jewel, and leans towards him, gently kissing him. Elrond addresses the council where Frodo sits amongst a council of free peoples of Middle-earth, with Elrond, Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and 20 other elves, dwarves, and men. Frodo steps forward, moves towards a stone plinth, places the ring on the plinth, and returns to his seat. Strider says nothing as Boromir turns away dismissively, then sharply as Legolas stands and Frodo looks at Strider questioningly.",
    "616": "The sun shines on Sydney's red brick building. He's in the kitchen making a fry-up. Alison comes in wearing his oversized pajamas. Rubbing her neck, she looks at the black and white photo Richard was inspecting. He turns back to the stove and continues to cook. Alison sits at the table. She looks at the bacon, sausage, egg, tomatoes, beans, and toast. She runs off with a hand over her mouth. Sydney plumps a cushion on his leather sofa and takes his father's book from the coffee table. In doing so, he knocks Alison's handbag to the floor. The contents tumble out and he scrabbles to collect them. He picks up Alison's red notebook. It's embossed with a gold image of a butterfly. He glances about furtively, then opens it and starts to read. He looks up again to find Alison watching him. She shrugs and takes a seat. She starts to gather her things from the coffee table. The soundtrack to Le Dolce Vita. Holding the record, she looks up with a smile. He takes the battered record sleeve from her. She closes her eyes and smiles as he puts the record on. Wearing a wry smile, Sydney starts to dance. He turns and offers Alison his hand. They dance. Sydney's pretty mother seems to watch from the photograph on the shelving unit, as Alison cracks a smile and dances a cheeky little jive with Sydney. He takes her by the hand and raises it above his head. Nestled between lush green trees and other crumbling apartment blocks. Sydney's building is dwarfed by the skyscrapers on the horizon. Alison sits at her desk as Ingrid goes through dresses with another model. Sydney listens at the door. Hearing Alison cross the office, he darts for a fire exit, setting off the alarm. He closes the door and turns back. A crowd of office workers convenes and turns back. He taps the sign on the door. He takes a wildlife book from a shelf. The crowd disperses but Alison remains. She watches him head off. Into his bathroom mirror. He sticks some fake fangs in. He wrinkles his nose. With white face paint, fangs, and a cape, he carries a glass of wine as he finds Elena dressed as Marlene Dietrich. She stands chatting. Sydney walks away. A person with an Elvis Presley costume kisses a nun. He heads over to Alison, who wears a black wig and holds a cigarette in a long holder. He removes the fangs. Lawrence gives her a glass of champagne, then kisses her on the cheek and walks away. Sydney shifts uncomfortably. He shakes his head. They sip their drinks and stare straight ahead. Sydney looks at Alison and sighs.",
    "489": "Sam stares at her, frowns in concern over her very real anxiety, goes to the phone, dials operator, and starts for the door, followed by Lila into the store. He pauses halfway down, turns, puts his hands on her arms. The silhouette of Norman is seen; he is still. Norman then turns slowly until, in silhouette, we see his profile, his chin lowered furtively as he looks over his shoulder in the direction of the house. The store is in darkness, only the glow from the back room spilling in. With the camera placed with its back to the street door, we see the distant tiny figure of Lila seated and waiting in the back room beyond. The tiny figure jumps up and runs all the way from the back room down the aisle of hardware and comes into a big head. From her viewpoint, we see Sam alighting from his truck and coming toward the door of the store. He enters, and he and Lila exchange quiet glances. She feels his pause, turns, and for a moment they share at each other across the darkened room. She hands the receiver to the Sheriff, who takes it reluctantly and listens to the dim sound of ringing on the other end. Sam and Lila stare at the Sheriff, who stares back at them, and when he finally speaks there is an almost inaudible tone of irony in his voice. Norman sits in the dim, one-lamp light, the phone next to him, his hand still near it as if he had not been able to move his hand after hanging up, staring at the shrike-like bird perched on the lamp shade. Suddenly, he rises, starts quickly out of the room, tries to switch off the lamp as he goes, and in so doing, succeeds only in knocking the bird off the shade. He then puts out the lamp, goes out, crosses the darkened office, and goes outside, coming off the porch. He walks to the path, directly up to the house, opens the door, and goes in. Norman goes up, pauses one moment outside his mother's door, then opens it and goes in, leaving the door open. He moves away and the others follow. She smiles brightly, as if having invited them over to discuss this year's charity fandango, takes the Sheriff's arm, and starts away. The Sheriff nods as he goes. Sam and Lila are alone now at the curb before the deserted chapel. As the truck drives off, Sam takes Lila's arm and starts with her toward the path that leads to the old house. The camera pans with them, and as they turn around the office corner, they see Norman coming down the path toward them.",
    "1190": "The street lights are reflected in the puddles on the damp pavements. At last, he slows down and looks around him. Ahead is a small patch of worn grass in a children's playground. He's alone. He sits wearily on the edge of the pavement, hunching his shoulders against the cold and damp. He looks up as the streetlight above his head flickers and goes out. In the playground, the empty swings begin to move. The roundabout turns and a seesaw clumps down onto the grass. In front of him, a huge black dog looms out of the bushes. Harry slowly rises to his feet. Harry pulls out his wand and stumbles backwards onto the pavement. A bright light approaches. A purple triple-decker bus draws up. The conductor reads from a dirty piece of card. Putting the card in his pocket, he looks down at Harry. Harry stares nervously at the bushes. Stan picks up the trunk, and Harry steps inside the bus. On the lower deck is a row of beds, one of which is occupied. Above his head, Harry sees galleries and a chandelier hanging from the roof. Stan Shunpike turns the handle of his machine and gives Harry a bus ticket. Stan knocks on the driver's window. The Rastafarian shrunken head, hanging above the driver, laughs. Ernie starts the bus. Harry falls backwards onto a bed. Ernie peers through thick glasses and drives erratically. The bus screeches to a halt. Harry's face hits the window. An old lady with a walking frame shuffles in front of the bus. Harry sees a picture in Stan's newspaper. Two London buses drive straight at them. Ernie pulls a lever. The bus and its occupants become narrow enough to squeeze between them. The bus hurdles off again down a narrow street. Harry hits the window again. They bump a parked car. Tom, the hunchback innkeeper, grins at Harry. The purple bus disappears into the night. Harry follows Tom into the Leaky Cauldron. Inside the gloomy public house, a man sits reading a book while a spoon stirs itself around a cup. Chairs turn themselves upside down onto the tables. In a room upstairs, Harry finds his snowy owl and the Minister for Magic, Mr. Fudge. As Tom hauls him up, Harry calls his owl. Harry gazes down at the busy marketplace below his window. A high-level train rattles past. Harry goes to the pile of books on the low table by the fire. One of the books is growling. He looks at its hairy cover, staring, glassy eyes and sharp, pointed teeth. Suddenly, the book goes berserk, snapping its covers. It leaps out of his hands and starts to snap at his feet.",
    "229": "Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site. A worker puts his head into the store. The Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in. The SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on the scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the workers. A glance occurs between Szpilman and Majorek. The SS Captain beams, but there is no reaction from the workers. He rubs his thumb and forefinger and leers, still receiving no reaction, and his smile vanishes. Snow. Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site. On the barrow, there are five sacks. Majorek pulls the barrow to where Szpilman waits, and Majorek is instantly awake. Majorek takes the paper but says nothing. He turns over and goes back to sleep, while Szpilman returns to his bunk. Szpilman has unloaded the sacks of potatoes into the corner and is kneeling, about to untie the string on the smallest sack, when a sound alerts him. He looks around and sees an SS Lieutenant entering the stores, sucking on his finger, which is bleeding. Szpilman immediately hurries to a cupboard, finds a First Aid tin, removes a plaster, and gives it to the SS Lieutenant. The lieutenant indicates the sacks with his chin. Szpilman tries to untie the string but is too terrified to manage it. The SS Lieutenant shoves him out of the way, takes a dagger from his belt, and cuts the string. The lieutenant reaches in and withdraws a handful of long yellow beans, glowers at Szpilman, reaches in again, and produces a handful of oatmeal. He throws the oatmeal in Szpilman's face, kicks him viciously, and marches away. Szpilman catches his breath, then quickly reaches into the bottom of the sack and finds a pistol and ammunition, which he hides under his clothes. Freezing cold, the Jewish workers, with their bundles of potatoes and bread, march back toward the ghetto gates escorted by two Polish policemen. Zick-Zack takes a swig of vodka and comes face to face with Szpilman, staring at him directly with glassy eyes. Szpilman is terrified, trying as surreptitiously as possible to cover his hidden package with his hands, and there is a moment of danger. Zick-Zack grabs Szpilman by the collar, finding this hilarious along with his comrade, and they recover from their laughter. The column starts to march, and after a brief silence, a solo voice from the back starts to sing, \"Children of Warsaw will go to fight!\" Szpilman glances back and sees that Majorek is singing. Szpilman smiles, Majorek nods, and Szpilman joins in. Now, so do the others, and they march on, singing lustily. Szpilman lies in a steaming bath, eyes closed, as though in a trance.",
    "1345": "Louis sees her, tries to stop, but can't, and his car slams. Alice gasps, stops pedaling, looks back at her father's car, wide-eyed and terrified, unsure if she should go back. Louis is bleeding, badly hurt. He adjusts himself painfully and looks into the cracked-glass rear view. Alice is still looking back at the car and doesn't see the shape coming behind her. Just as she decides not to go back, she turns to begin riding on. Louis tries to get out of the car, but it's painful, and his door is jammed shut, so he goes for the passenger door. When Louis finally gets out, he runs from his car, stumbling drunk and bleeding, screaming, shredding his voice. A distant factory, even more distant mountains, and an ominous plume of smoke are seen, while a far-off siren is heard. Joe stands at the counter with Charles, who is in a bad mood. Donny returns with a developed film envelope and gives Charles his change. Charles heads off, and Joe follows. As Charles rides off with the film, Joe follows, and they boom up along the water tower as they go. As they continue booming up, they arrive at the top of the water tower, where the cube has affixed itself to the side, unseen from the street. Joe and Charles ride their bikes up to his house. Frustrated beyond belief, Charles goes inside, and Joe follows. Charles threads the film into the projector, and suddenly on the poster board pinned to the closet, there she is: Alice, from the night of the train crash. The scene plays as they filmed it. The filmed scene continues as Joe and Charles argue. Joe's mind spins; he doesn't know how to respond to this. They watch for a moment as the train crash happens, but it's so sudden, so fast, the camera picks up almost nothing. Within a moment, the camera is on its side, filming the settling debris. Charles moves forward, so the film is now partially being projected on him. Joe moves forward, and part of the film is projected on him, too. But Joe has seen something on the screen, sotto. Joe has slapped Charles' arm, his eyes locked to the screen. Charles looks too, and now they see it through the train car wreckage: something too big, mostly out of frame, its shape and flesh too bizarre, with only the legs visible as it clears the frame. On film, then from outside, an air raid siren ramps, whining through the town.",
    "637": "Graham's station wagon returns to the farm and pulls up outside Merrill's converted barn. Merrill and Graham undo their seat belts and turn towards the buzzing noise from the back. Morgan picks up a pale blue radio receiver from beside him on the seat, while Bo sits next to him in a child's car seat. She watches Morgan as he puts the receiver to his ear and points to the sky. Merrill sighs and turns away. Graham watches his brother, ponders, and then turns back to Morgan, reaching back for the receiver. Morgan gives it to him, and Graham and Merrill stare at each other and listen. Merrill sits back exasperated as Graham gets out, followed by the rest of the family. Bo freezes in shock, and Merrill looks down at Morgan and considers. Graham leans back down into the car as Merrill looks uneasy. Graham slowly stands while Merrill reaches out his hand. Together, Merrill and Graham hold the receiver across the car roof. Morgan climbs onto the roof, crawls towards Graham and Merrill, and takes the receiver. Bo runs around to the bonnet and clambers up, but Graham sits on the bonnet to prevent her from getting any further. Merrill gets onto the roof with Morgan and holds him steady as Morgan points the receiver up to the sky. Bo struggles to get onto the roof, and Merrill takes hold of her hand as Morgan slowly lowers the receiver and looks at it. Bo slides back down into Graham's lap. Carrying a metal dish of dog food for Isabel in one hand, Graham steps out of the farmhouse through a screen door into the dark, walking steadily across the lawn to where the Alsatian is chained to its kennel. Agitated, Isabel shifts and jumps about, pulling at the chain and barking into the quivering field of maize. Graham stops just short of the dog and looks out into the darkened field, slowly turning his body to face the crop. Isabel lunges at Graham, who recoils, then stares in surprise at the dog before turning back to the gently rustling field. Isabel remains agitated. Graham opens a battered metal toolbox resting on a picnic bench and lifts out a large torch. Inching cautiously forward and holding out his free hand, he directs the circular torch beam onto the edge of the crop. Graham walks slowly up to the wall of maize and steps inside the tall dense corn, venturing on at an even pace and moving down a narrow channel between two rows of rigid stalks. The white torchlight angled low illuminates the limp straggly green leaves, which bend back as he pushes through them.",
    "1117": "She waves her wand. Harry blinks as his glasses repair themselves. She takes him to a bookshop where the Weasley family are standing near the counter. A queue of excited customers are waiting to get their book signed. A blond man with a blue suit and matching cloak appears. He smiles smugly. Posing for the camera, Lockhart spots Harry's grubby face in the crowd. The photographer pulls Harry forward. Ron pulls a face. They head for the door. A boy with very fair hair tears a page from a book. He steps in front of Harry. A man with long fair hair touches Harry's forehead with his snake-topped cane. The Grangers are chatting to Mr. Weasley. He looks at Ron. He takes a book from Jenny's cauldron. He slips two books back into Jenny's cauldron. Mr. Weasley smiles reassuringly at his children. Lucius turns on his heel. Draco glares at Ron and Harry. At King's Cross and Pancras Station, Harry and Louisa hurry along Platform 10 with loaded trolleys. The twins and Percy push their trolleys straight towards the brick wall between the two platforms. They disappear through it one after the other. Jenny follows. Mr. and Mrs. Weasley head for the wall. On Platform 10, Harry heads for the wall with Ron close behind. They hit solid brick. They collapse in a heap of trolleys and luggage. Hedwig flaps her wings. A porter comes over. Ron looks thoughtful. Outside the station, the blue Ford Anglia rises unsteadily into the air. A taxi driver looks up in amazement. Ron presses a button on the dashboard. High above London, the car disappears. Thick cloud gradually clears, revealing low green hills far below. The car suddenly reappears. Ron changes gear and steers the car down towards the railway line. They skim above the track over a magnificent stone viaduct. They look back with horror. The Hogwarts Express is right behind them. Ron jacks the wheel to the left. The car swerves away from the track and swoops under the viaduct. It tumbles between the stone arches, turning over and over. The car door flies open and Harry falls out. Harry has managed to grab the door handle. He hangs on precariously above the train. Ron stretches down towards him. Harry reaches desperately for his hand. Harry grabs Ron's outstretched hand and manages to scramble back inside the car. Ron turns the wheel. The train thunders on beneath a plume of white smoke. As darkness falls, the car headlights pick out the towers of Hogwarts School. Ron glances at Harry. Harry's smile of delight fades as the car engine falters. Ron struggles with the wheel as the car swoops out of control, zooming close to the brightly lit windows of the Great Hall.",
    "103": "Forrest runs across a cobble-stone bridge with the Rocky Mountains in the distance, and split rail fences line the road as he runs through some meadowland. Meanwhile, three men in the barber shop watch the news on television, and Jenny fills customer's coffee cups. Forrest continues running as a young man runs up to him and jogs behind him, as Forrest runs up a slope on a high mountain road with a group of people jogging behind him. The large group follows Forrest across the desert road, through a small town, where a man runs up and talks to him, while a hippie stops to ponder a profound thought. A truck with a bumper sticker drives into an intersection and collides with a car. Forrest runs, followed by his group, as another man runs up to him. Forrest wipes his face on a towel and hands it back to the man, who looks at the T-shirt. Forrest runs with a group that follows behind him until he stops, and the group stops behind him. Forrest stands and looks as the group waits expectantly, then he turns and looks, walks toward the group, which parts for him as he walks down the middle of the road. A television shows President Reagan and his staff reacting to gunshots in front of a limo, while Forrest sits eating a sandwich, watching the news of the assassination attempt. Forrest takes a letter out of his pocket, which an elderly woman looks at, then hastily grabs his suitcase and letter as he stands. A truck honks its horn as Forrest runs across the street past the truck, and the elderly woman shouts from the bus stop bench as Jenny opens and then shuts the door. Forrest looks around and hands Jenny the box of chocolates. Jenny picks up a scrapbook and turns the pages as there is a knock at the door, Lynn Marie enters as she opens it, and Jenny grabs a young boy. The little boy runs into another room and picks up the TV remote control as Forrest continues to stare at Forrest Jr., then looks frightened and starts to back away. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest Jr. in the other room as Forrest breathes deep, looks at Jenny, then at Forrest Jr., walks into the room, and sits down next to Forrest Jr. Jenny walks out of the house, and Forrest walks over to greet her. She wears a white dress and walks up to Forrest, adjusting his necktie. Lt. Dan walks across the lawn using a cane, accompanied by a woman, as Jenny walks over to Forrest and Lt. Dan.",
    "286": "She seems to be trying to figure out what to do or where to go, and she nervously looks at a couple of men passersby. He quickly raises his long-focus camera to his eye, and we are now given a waist-high shot as the focus is adjusted by Jeff. The figure is that of Miss Lonely Hearts. Getting no reaction, she crosses the street and seats herself at an empty table in front of the cafe, where she orders a drink. She is suddenly blotted out by a figure of a man who enters the picture from the left side. It is Thorwald, carrying a lightweight cardboard box under his arm. The camera pans him over to the right until he is lost behind the building. He is much nearer the lens because he is on this side of the street, and he is, therefore, slightly out of focus. He lowers the lens, and we see Jeff's eyes travel across the screen as he imagines Thorwald's progression. Then sharpening his look, he picks up the long-focus lens, and easing himself back cautiously, begins watching Thorwald. Thorwald comes up the corridor and stands unlocking his door. As he hesitates, we can see the cardboard box he is carrying has the name of a laundry on it. He enters the apartment and turns on the living room lights. He proceeds to the bedroom, and the lights go on there. A number of suits and top coats are lying in an orderly pile on the bed. He takes the laundry out of the box and puts it on the bed next to the suits. Then he goes to the dresser, and instead of putting the laundry away, he proceeds to take out the contents of the drawers--pajamas, shirts, socks, etc. He piles these on the bed. Jeff lowers the camera quickly. He picks up the phone and dials a number, still keeping his eyes on Thorwald. The phone buzzes on filter, then is picked up and answered by a woman. For a moment, Jeff looks desperate. As he talks thoughtfully, he takes some jewelry from the handbag -- a couple of rings, diamond wristwatch, brooch, pearls, etc. He discusses each piece, apparently trying to make some decision. Jeff lowers his camera lens and edges his chair forward in an effort to hear what Thorwald is saying. The first four of the songwriter's guests come through the door, admitted by the songwriter's girlfriend. The songwriter dashes off a loud vamp of greeting on the piano, then gets up to offer drinks. Jeff turns his attention back to Thorwald but gives up any attempt at listening. He lifts the long-focus lens up to his eyes again.",
    "704": "The brownhead girl smiles, holds out her hand, and places a locket in Flint's huge palm. He clenches his fist around it. A red flashing light spills into the room, and Flint strides over to the window, climbing out onto the fire escape. Emma, Penny's mother, watches him go with a worn, cynical expression. Peter is riding along a quiet street in the dark. He parks outside Aunt May's apartment. Aunt May looks down, her eyes glistening with tears, and sweeps back a lock of her white hair. She takes off her ring. Peter takes the ring and gazes gratefully at his aunt, who smiles back at him warmly. He leans forward, and they hug, holding each other in a warm embrace. After dark, Peter, wearing a dopey smile, rides along a city street. A masked figure in dark green swoops down on a hoverboard and carries him up onto the rooftops. The masked attacker headbutts Peter and clamps a hand across his mouth. Jagged blades spring from his forearms, and he slashes at Peter's stomach. Peter jumps free of the hoverboard and shoots a web thread to the top of a skyscraper. Swinging from the thread, he shoots webbing balls. The attacker ducks to avoid them and slices through Peter's thread. Peter falls, and his dark green mystery attacker smashes him into a wall high above the ground. Stuck in the wall, Peter looks up in a daze as the figure in dark green hovers down towards him and slides his visor back. Peter dodges a huge punch. Harry prises out the section of the wall Peter is clinging to. Peter hangs on as it plummets towards the street below, but Harry swoops down after him, smashing the chunk of wall into fragments. Peter swings away on a thread, but Harry flies at him, thumping him into the air like a ball on elastic. Peter falls. Harry grabs him, dragging and thumping him against the high walls as he flies, then hurling him through a corner of a window. As Peter floats out of the other shattered window, he sees Aunt May's ring spinning through the air in front of him. He then tries to snatch at it. Harry grabs him from behind. Both men balance on the narrow, sweeping hoverboard, the Sky Stick, as they fight. Peter throws Harry off the Sky Stick and fires a couple of web threads, using them to catapult himself down after the falling ring. The Sky Stick automatically zooms down to collect the falling Harry. Peter swings down and is just grabbing the ring when Harry strikes him again, sending him sprawling onto a rooftop. Peter opens his fist and looks down at the ring nestled in his palm, then turns and runs as Harry swoops down.",
    "486": "Norman looks at a picture hanging on the far end of the wall he is leaning against, reaches it, touches it, and reluctantly lifts the small frame off the wall. A tiny circle of light hits Norman's face from the hole in the wall behind the picture. This end of the room is very dim, allowing us to see clearly the light striking Norman's face. We move close to Norman, extremely close, until his profile fills the screen, and the tiny spot of light hits his eye. We see the small hole through which the light comes, and Norman peeps through. Through the hole, we look into Mary's cabin and see Mary undressing; she is in her bra and half-slip. She stoops over a bit, places her hands behind her upper back, and begins to unhook her bra. Norman watches as Mary removes her bra, and we see his eye run up and down the unseen figure of Mary. Mary is just slipping into a robe, covering her complete nudity. Norman turns from the hole, faces us for a moment, continues turning until he can look out the small parlor window. Quickly and precisely, he rehangs the picture over the hole in the wall, turns, and starts out of the parlor. We see him go through the office and out onto the porch, not even bothering to close the door behind him. Norman walks along the porch, in the direction of the big house. Once on the path, he pauses, looks up at the light in the bedroom window, then pulls himself up, squares his shoulders, and strides manfully up the path. He opens the door of the house and enters. We see him pause at the foot of the stairway and look up at the bedroom door just at the head of the stair. He bypasses the stairs and slowly makes his way to the kitchen at the far end of the hall. He enters the kitchen and drops wearily into a chair. Meanwhile, Mary is seated at a small desk, engrossed in figuring in a small notebook. After a moment, she tears the page out of the notebook and, rising, begins to rip it into small pieces. She goes into the bathroom, drops the pieces into the toilet bowl, and flushes the toilet. Then she drops her robe, steps into the tub, and turns the shower on. For a moment, we watch Mary as she washes and soaps herself. We then see the bathroom door being pushed slowly open and the shadow of a woman fall across the shower curtain. Mary's back is turned to the curtain. Suddenly, a hand reaches up, grasps the shower curtain, and rips it aside, causing a look of pure horror to erupt on her face.",
    "835": "In an office, a handsome, well-groomed man checks his cell phone and answers. On a cell phone, in the food court, a plump redhead smiles and pumps her fist. Now, in a cluttered house, she wipes her hair dry and punches numbers into a keypad. Along a mirror, fake IDs with the redhead's photo hang from a string. A machine spits out a credit card with Sandy's name on it. The redhead adds it to a stack of fake cards and walks off with a determined expression. Now, at a hip bar, she enters wide-eyed and approaches the bartender. She eyes two men doing shots. She hands him Sandy's credit card. She downs a shot with the guys. Now, the redhead chugs a bottle of green liqueur. She finishes it off and raises her arms. The bartender adds drinks to her tab, totaling over $2,000. Standing on a table, she throws a bottle. She leaps for the chandelier and lands flat on the floor. The bar patrons watch her lie motionless. As a few of them reach down and poke her, she springs up. The frustrated bartender makes his way over as she high-fives patrons. She punches him in the throat. He collapses. Now, a police car pulls up to the bar. Later, two officers escort her out. She breathes into a tube and spews green vomit on the officer. As he shakes it off, she turns to the other officer. At the police station, the plump identity thief stands in front of a height chart. Now, the real Sandy sits in front of a birthday cake, surrounded by his beautiful wife and two young daughters. She gives him a paper tie. He picks her up. He puts her face in the cake. She straddles Sandy's lap and looks him in the eyes. He pulls her close and kisses her tenderly. She raises her brow. He carries her out of the room. Daytime. Sandy slowly drives down a congested highway. Later, carrying a briefcase, the well-groomed businessman walks through an enclosed courtyard and enters an office building. Now, Sandy steps off an elevator and walks to his office. A co-worker wearing a suit approaches. Sandy puts down a file and follows Cornish's assistant. He peeks into an office, where Cornish beckons him to enter. Cornish gestures to an earphone. He keeps Sandy from sitting. Cornish shuts the door. Now, Sandy inputs a code into a keypad and enters the records room. He makes his way to a computer station behind a cage wall. He holds up a small packet that lists the partners with substantial bonuses by their names. The bottom name reads Harold Cornish $1.2 million. On the computer, he types Cornish's name onto a check, then answers his cell phone.",
    "1162": "A dark narrow corridor, dimly lit and festooned with cobwebs, leads to the scene where the patterned tiles underfoot are cracked and dirty. Harry hesitates, but Moody pushes past him impatiently, followed by the others moving toward an open door at the end of the gloomy passage. Nymphadora turns and winks at Harry, but she trips over an umbrella stand. Through the open door, Harry spots Mr. Weasley, Sirius, and Lupin, and as she comes out closing the door, she hugs him warmly and looks at him closely. A house elf emerges onto the landing dragging a wooden box. It has skinny arms, a long pointed nose and ears, and wears a ragged vest, glaring spitefully at Harry. The elf stands on the box and polishes a picture frame. Harry opens a door and is nearly knocked off his feet by Hermione, with Ron standing behind her. Harry looks around the bedroom and his eyes widen as the Weasley twins dangle a magic ear over the banisters. Hermione's cat, Crookshanks, sees the ear and grabs at it with his paw, then runs off with it, chased by Fred and George. Harry embraces his godfather Sirius, who holds him close. Harry's photograph is underneath, and Sirius looks directly at Harry and winks at him. Ron sleeps peacefully, but Harry's sleep is disturbed by dreams. The scene shifts to a down escalator on the London Underground where Mr. Weasley stands stiffly holding both handrails. Nearing the bottom, he braces himself and steps off unsteadily as Harry follows him. At the barrier, Mr. Weasley copies other passengers by placing his palm on the automatic ticket reader pad, but the gate remains shut. Harry puts a ticket in the slot, and with Mr. Weasley leaning back against the gates, they open and he slips through backwards looking delighted. On street level, they find a red telephone box and step inside, as the inside of the box sinks below the surface of the pavement like a lift, with a replacement interior sliding down to fill the empty space as the box comes to a halt. Mr. Weasley opens the door and they step out into a cavernous tiled hall lined on either side with enormous fireplaces, as the telephone box lift disappears above their heads. People appear from the fireplaces in flashes of green smoke, carrying briefcases and bundles of papers, joining the throngs of other witches and wizards hurrying to work through the great underground hall. Harry follows Mr. Weasley past a fountain with huge golden statues, looking up at a gigantic silken banner floating above with a moving image of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. They crowd into a Victorian lift with metal gates, as paper airplanes swoop around their heads. Kingsley pushes into the lift and whispers to Mr. Weasley, the gates close, and the lift moves backwards before dropping downwards.",
    "48": "He opens another drawer and pulls out various sandwiches wrapped in wax paper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine, and two Dixie cups. He uncorks the wine, fills a cup, and begins eating. He hands her a sandwich and fills a wine-cup for her. He reaches back into the drawer and pulls out a glass which he gives her. FOUR MEN, all in army uniform, sit behind a table. The glass is held over the first, magnifying the face. It's a photo of a young CHARLES LAMPERT. The glass and CAMERA move to the fourth face -- a young. REGGIE nods. He writes something on a pad of paper and tears it off, handing it to her. A ROAR from the CHILDREN. REGGIE and PETER turn toward the stage. PUNCH and JUDY are arguing loudly. PUNCH and JUDY are batting each other on the head. Finally, JUDY knocks Punch out of sight and a PUPPET wearing a three-cornered hat appears. Wearing a hat, he stands off in the background, watching. JUDY and the POLICEMAN are batting one another. PUNCH's head appears on the other side of the stage, says something, then ducks out. Charles was mixed up in something terrible. JUDY has gotten the upper hand and is now batting the POLICEMAN's brains out. CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE as he winces. He stands on the dance floor in front of a five-piece Latin dance band, a spotlight on him, wearing his professional smile as he speaks into a mike. At their table, REGGIE is dressed in a lovely Givenchy dress. As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin, he stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting, he merely closes his eyes. Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward. REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance. She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him for a moment. Slowly, his eyes open, and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange. GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes. She realizes she has not pushed the button which takes her coin and allows the party at the other end to hear her voice. TEX takes a book of matches from his pocket. He strikes a match and lights his cigarette, holding the burning match in his hand afterward. TEX, without a word, throws the still-lit match into the booth, onto REGGIE's lap. She beats it out frantically. He lights another match and reaches out toward her hair with it.",
    "78": "From RACHEL's viewpoint, through a screen, she sees PREACHER's face twitch with emotion, and he breaks out into great thankful sobs. As RUBY minces off around the side of the house, PREACHER watches her and wipes off his tears with the heel of his left hand. He holds up his right hand as all the CHILDREN enter around the corner of the house. As they move in, RACHEL replies, and by now, JOHN is on the top step beside her, one of his hands holding on to her skirt as if pulling her towards him, his eyes never leaving hers. All the CHILDREN freeze, with PEARL on the ground just beyond JOHN. He looks up at RACHEL, and JOHN looks deep into her eyes, wanting the situation clarified. She takes this in, realizing JOHN has sold her, then looks to PREACHER o.s., who gets to his feet with an open knife in his hand. As they see it, a gun-barrel twitches. PREACHER backs away towards his horse, bouncing the knife lightly in his hand, and as he mounts his horse, the scene shifts. RACHEL sits in profile with a gun across her knees in a big bed, while RUBY sits up listening to a song o.s. We pan to PREACHER outside, seen through the window as he sits hunched on a stump. After a moment, as RACHEL opens her mouth, either to comfort herself or to drown out PREACHER's voice, she joins in the hymn. A descending candle moves past a window as RACHEL and PREACHER sing o.s., and over the back of RACHEL's head, the song ends. RUBY enters the shot carrying a candle, which blacks out the window-glass. RACHEL looks up and blows out the candle; through the window, PREACHER has gone. She stands up as RUBY leaves the shot, and RACHEL moves towards the window, looks up, and sees the CHILDREN looking at her with complete trust. She turns around and walks back to her chair, with the CHILDREN's eyes always on her, her eyes glittering as she turns to look towards us. As the clock starts striking three, RACHEL looks to the sound o.s. In the mirror, a shadow ducks. RACHEL gets up, gun at port, and faces into the darkness. Eyes on the darkness, she bends low to the CHILDREN, who scatter out of the shot; RUBY lingers, then obeys in a trance. RACHEL, gun at the ready, looks into the darkness as PREACHER's satanic face and his hand lifting the open knife rise swiftly from the floor. She fires off her gun, and PREACHER staggers out, runs yelping with pain into the barn. The CHILDREN huddle on the stairs in reverent silence while RACHEL, her gun slung sportily under one arm, talks into the wall phone, which hangs just within the box stairway. RACHEL sits on the screened porch, awake, with a gun on her knees, as JOHN sits on the floor asleep, his head leaning against her.",
    "892": "He mops his sweaty brow with a handkerchief and closes his book. Lizzie comes in defiantly and goes to stand closer to her father, giving her hysterical mother a wry smile. Outside, Lydia and Kitty are heading out and they all look back at the house as Charlotte heads towards the house. Charlotte pauses for a moment, lost in thought, and inside, Mr. Collins is packing. He bows, and Charlotte follows him out. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery as Lydia and Kitty hurry excitedly over to their house, Longbourn, and burst through the front door. Jane sets down her embroidery as Lizzie slumps into a chair opposite. The housekeeper comes in and hands a letter to Jane, curtsies, and then leaves the room. Trunks and boxes are being ferried out of Netherfield, and in their cloaks and bonnets, Kitty, Lydia, and Lizzie make their way through the busy town. As Denny takes Lydia's arm and Kitty is escorted away by Carter, Wickham smiles hopefully at Lizzie, who beams back at him. The pair walk through the town together. Later, Mrs. Bennet emerges from Longbourn, engrossed in conversation with Denny, and as the three girls follow their mother and the officers outside, Lizzie catches Wickham's eye with a smile. He nods politely towards her mother, then the three officers leave. Just as the girls are heading back inside, Lydia chases after them, reaches up, and whispers something to him. He strides off with Carter and Wickham. Inside, the tea things are being cleared away in the drawing room, where Mr. Bennet, Mary, and Jane are sitting. Mrs. Bennet bustles in, and the girls laugh as Mr. Bennet walks out. Jane is washing her hands in a basin in her room. Drying her hands, Jane sits at the top of the four-poster bed, Lizzie's at the bottom, and with a look of concern, Lizzie moves and sits next to Jane, looking at her and smiling. A carriage, drawn by four white horses, pulls into the drive at Longbourn, and as Mrs. Bennet comes running out of the house followed by Mr. Bennet and their daughters, a portly gentleman, Edward Gardiner, and his wife emerge from the carriage. Charlotte Lucas enters followed by Jane, and as they make their way across the crowded room, a girl with red hair eyes them curiously. They pass Lizzie, who's engaged in a conversation with Wickham. Mrs. Bennet sits with Mrs. Phillips and Mrs. Gardiner as Lizzie approaches with Wickham. Mrs. Bennet purses her lips, exchanges a glance with her sister, and haughtily walks off. Lizzie takes Wickham's hand and leads him to the dance floor, passing the girl with red hair who gives Wickham a shy smile.",
    "319": "Frodo's trembling hand extends forward as if by the pull of the ring, and he slides to the ground, unable to pull his hand away. The witch king snarls and springs forward, stabbing at Frodo with a wicked dagger; Frodo winces as the tip of the dagger sinks into his shoulder. Suddenly, Strider charges at the Ringwraiths, wielding his sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, moving in slow motion, visible through a sea of mist. Frodo sinks to the ground, and with draining strength, he manages to pull the ring off his finger. Appearing back in the real world, Sam rushes over to him as the distant cry of a Ringwraith carries through the air, and Frodo gasps in sudden pain. Sam and Strider desperately search the dark forest floor for the Athelas plant, and Strider drops to one knee, carefully pulling a small, white flowered plant from the ground. Strider slowly looks up as Frodo is breathing hard, desperately ill. Frodo's half-conscious point of view shows a surreal impression of a shimmering figure in white leaping off a horse, revealing an ethereal vision of Arwen, who now appears in her earthbound form, a young Elven woman with tousled hair, dressed in mud-splattered riding clothes. Strider finds it hard to let her go as Arwen mounts her horse, Asfaloth, looks down at Strider, and supports Frodo with one hand. Asfaloth springs away, bearing Arwen and Frodo into the night, through the forest from the back of the white horse. An aerial view shows Arwen's white horse emerging from the trees and galloping across the open land as the sun rises; Frodo lifts his head weakly. The white horse charges through a pine forest as the horse's head bobs and trees slide by, with moonlight flickering through the trees. Suddenly, two galloping Ringwraiths emerge from the trees behind, and two more Ringwraiths slide in from different directions to join the chase. The white horse speeds out of the pine trees with the four Ringwraiths close behind, as two more Ringwraiths gallop down the hillside. An aerial shot shows three more Ringwraiths entering the frame from different directions, making a total of nine Ringwraiths now pursuing Frodo and Arwen. Arwen grits her teeth and urges the white horse to greater speed. The witch king screeches angrily, draws his sword, and leads the Ringwraiths across the Ford. Arwen gathers the small Hobbit in her arms, feeling his life slip away as a bright light suddenly flares. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, gasping. Frodo's eyes flicker open to find he is lying in bed next to an open window with dappled sunlight playing on richly carved timbers. The sound of a nearby waterfall drifts through the vista of fir trees, and Gandalf softly puffs on his pipe.",
    "335": "Saruman stands over the Palantir, his hands cupping the massive eye, then is seated as his Orc Overseer approaches while Gandalf lies unconscious on a cold obsidian floor. Gandalf stands as the camera pulls back to reveal him stranded on the summit of Orthanc, marooned on the tiny, flat peak, surrounded on all sides by a sheer 500-foot drop. Another whispering wail rends the air as Gandalf crosses quickly to the edge and peers down: POV: One of the beautiful Isengard trees is being ripped from the ground by the Orcs, and Gandalf looks on in horror as Orcs hack into the trunk with axes. Saruman stands in the rain looking out into the dark night as the Orc overseer sidles up to him, axe in hand, sweating with exertion, and more and more trees are hauled down and killed as Gandalf looks on in helpless despair. Meanwhile, the rugged countryside shows the hobbits journeying on, led by Strider, who stops before a distant hill topped by an ancient ruin. Frodo, Merry, and Pippin collapse into a small hollow halfway up Weathertop, muddy and exhausted, as Strider drops four small swords at the hobbits' feet. Frodo's eyes flicker open, and he suddenly sits up, sniffing the air while Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddle over a small fire with sausages and bacon sizzling in a hot frying pan. Five Ringwraiths on foot are running up the steep slope unnaturally fast, prompting Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin to clamber desperately towards the summit, clutching their swords. They race into a ring of broken stones on the summit of Weathertop, the ruined base of an ancient tower, and stand back-to-back in the centre of the ring, waiting for the first assault. One by one, the five Ringwraiths appear, brandishing gleaming swords, moving slowly towards the hobbits, with their leader, the Witch King, in the center. Sam rushes forward with a cry and swings his sword at the Witch King, who blocks the blow with his own sword, causing Sam's blade to shatter as the Witch King lashes out with his fist, sending Sam flying. Merry and Pippin, overcome with terror, throw themselves flat on the ground. In slow motion, Frodo's hand goes into his pocket and pulls out the ring as the Ringwraiths close in on Frodo, with a venomous whisper dancing in his head. The five Ringwraiths utter a chilling screech of excitement as Frodo is unable to resist any longer, falls to his knees, and slips on the ring, disappearing. Frodo finds himself in the weird twilight world, where he looks upon the Ringwraiths, now visible in their true appearance as five ghouls dressed in long grey robes with white hair and pallid, ruthless faces, as the Witch King extends a haggard hand towards Frodo, reaching for the ring on his finger.",
    "1240": "Brian's sons, Nigel and Simon, scribble on pads of paper at Brian's desk as Brian eyes the players from his office doorway, looking apprehensive as he watches the team warm up and keeps his wary eye fixed on the players. Jimmy and Brian stroll towards the team milling about on the training pitch, where the Leeds players, in purple team tracksuits with their surnames on their backs, form a semicircle facing Brian with stout redhead Bremner who dived for the penalty in the Derby Cup clash beside lanky Giles. The players swap disgruntled looks as Brian rounds on Bremner and nods emphatically. Jimmy tosses a ball at Brian, who keeps it up with his feet and head, then turns for goal and volleys it in as Brian plays with the team. Giles floors Brian, and Jimmy helps him up while Bremner leers, laughing. Brian listens outside the dressing room and later sits beside Peter on the team bus as it pulls into the Elland Road car park with his team in their dressing room, where Brian and Peter embrace as they follow the teams up the tunnel. Don is interviewed on TV, which Brian and Peter watch. In training, Brian and Peter watch Don and the Leeds team get off their bus. Peter marches into the Derby home dressing room, where the Derby players tuck the white shirts of their home kit into their shorts and sit on benches as Brian strolls in, standing at one end of the dressing room with his arms folded, casting an eye over the players sat on benches lining the walls. He strolls to the far end of the dressing room, kneels before a heavy-featured, sandy-haired lad, looks him in the eye, and the young man smiles bashfully and hangs his head as Brian rises to his feet, looks around the other players, and his eyes meet Dave Mackay's with whom he exchanges a respectful, knowing nod. Straightening his tie as he turns and walks across the dressing room, Brian sits beside a dark-haired, fresh-faced guy who's rubbing his thighs in agitation, apes a scared face, and then beams at the rest of the team. Brian nudges his shoulder against the young players, stands before the team, and a smile spreads across his face as he looks around the players. The Derby players leap to their feet and roar, red-faced, then run out of the dressing room, down the gloomy corridor, and up the tunnel into the daylight on the pitch. As play gets underway, the Leeds players, in their away kit of blue shirts and yellow shorts, pass the ball wide, while in his dingy office, Brian smokes as he watches the clock with sunlight streaming in from the terraces through the narrow windows set high in the stark walls.",
    "122": "Phyllis smiles faintly and covers the anklet with her dress. She rises and walks up and down, paying less and less attention. He consults the policies he is holding. Phyllis stops in her walk and sits down again, in the same position as before. His eyes fall on the anklet again. Neff takes his hat and briefcase, and they both move toward the archway. He walks out, handing her his hat and briefcase, and continues right on to a door lettered. Neff grins as he opens the door and goes into a minor executive office, not too tidy, with a large desk across one corner, good carpet, several chairs, a filing cabinet against one wall, and a dictaphone on the corner of the desk. On the other side of the desk sits Sam Gorlopis, a big, dumb bruiser, six feet three inches tall, wearing a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, with rough, untidy hair, a broad face, and small piggish eyes. He holds a sweat-soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand and sees Neff standing inside the door. He looks cautiously sideways at Keyes, pounds the pit of his stomach, and Gorlopis cringes under the impact. He puts a blank form in front of him and points; Gorlopis hesitates, then signs laboriously. He goes out, closing the door after him. Keyes takes his cigar stub from his mouth and turns it slowly in the flame of a lighted match, then turns to Neff. Neff walks out, still grinning, comes out of Keyes' office, and walks back along the balcony, past the activity of secretaries going in and out of doors, etc. Neff enters his own office, where Anderson, a salesman, sits at one of the desks, filling out a report. Neff goes to his own desk, looks down at some mail, reads it, sits down, and leafs through his desk calendar. The camera pans with Phyllis Dietrichson's feet and ankles as she comes down the stairs, her high heels clicking on the tiles. The anklet glistens on her leg as she moves, and the camera pans on. Phyllis reaches the entrance hall, and as she walks toward the front door her whole body becomes visible. She wears a gay print dress with a wide sash over her hips and opens the door. Outside is Neff, wearing a sport coat and flannel slacks. He takes his hat off and stands there with a little smile. He comes in as she leads him toward the living room. Phyllis and Neff come through the archway, she heads toward a low tea table which stands in front of the davenport, with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, a pot of tea, etc., and she pours herself a glass of tea.",

In the background, the ghost starts walking toward her. The shape moves forward. Laurie is sitting on the couch knitting. Laurie crosses to answer the phone. Lynda holds the phone to her ear. The ghost walks up slowly behind her. Laurie answers the telephone. He raises his hands to grab her. Lynda hears Laurie's hello as the ghost grabs the phone. He takes the telephone cord and wraps it around her neck. She squirms and writhes. He wraps the cord around her neck. Laurie hears squeals and rustling sounds across the phone. Laurie continues to hear weird sounds. He pulls tight. Lynda tries to fight off the ghost. Lynda gasps and tries to scream. The man pulls the cord tighter. She opens her mouth, trying to get air, then slowly slumps forward and remains motionless. Lynda reaches up and pulls on the sheet. It slides off the man, to reveal the grotesque Halloween mask. The shape picks up the receiver and puts it to his ear. Suddenly the phone goes dead. Laurie stares at the receiver, then hangs up. She crosses to the window and looks out toward the Wallace house. The street is quiet, dark, and windy. Bob's car is parked in front of the Wallace house. She stares at the house, puzzled. Laurie moves from the window back to the telephone and dials Annie's number. Laurie finally hangs up the phone. She stands for a moment considering it, then turns and walks upstairs. The kids are asleep. Tommy and Lindsey are sound asleep on the bed. She looks at them a moment, then closes the door behind her. Loomis sits in silence behind the hedge watching the Myers house. For a moment he glances back at the Myers house, then starts down the quiet residential street. He turns away from the street. It is empty except for a station wagon parked several blocks away. Then a thought strikes him. He looks again. Frustrated, he gets up and walks to the street. Slowly Loomis starts walking down the street toward the station wagon. Tracking shot with Loomis as he walks up the street. The station wagon moves closer. He recognizes it and races forward. Camera tracks in to the station wagon, right up to the state emblem emblazoned on the side. Loomis stands by his car glancing up and down the empty street. Finally, he makes up his mind and starts moving down the street, almost running, looking back and forth at the rows of houses on either side for something out of place.",
    "406": "He looks out the gap where the window should be and sees Dil in the lift. She passes by a gap in the wall and blows a kiss at him. Fergus walks out of the room and around the scaffolding. Dil sees him and waves, sits on some bricks, opens the hamper, and takes out a thermos to pour him some tea. Fergus smiles in spite of himself. She lowers her head, and he removes her glasses to look at her moist eyes. Fergus stands up suddenly, and Deveroux stares, suddenly chilled. Fergus looks down to Dil and holds out his arm. Dil gathers up her things and takes it, her face wreathed in a smile. Fergus walks her down the scaffolding ramp, and they descend from the site in the lift, which stops with a thud. She leans forward and kisses him. Fergus hears a wail of catcalls behind him and watches Dil go as the lift takes him back up to the site. Fergus stands outside the hair salon, as Dil, inside, throws off her smock and walks toward him with all the girls smiling. Fergus looks from Dil to the girls as they approach, and she takes his arm as they walk off. Fergus hears a car following them and turns around to look. They reach her door, and the car stops. Fergus kisses her and looks at her open lips as if in disbelief at himself. She goes inside, and Fergus walks into the room, turning on a small desk-light. Then he hears a voice and sees Jude sitting in the corner with her hair now dark brown. He stares at her, says nothing as she walks around the room, lies down on the bed beside him, takes off a black leather glove, and puts her hand on his crotch. He takes her hand away, and she looks at him hard. He leaps up from the bed, and she brings her lips close to his so they touch. He grabs her hair and pulls her head back, but she pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth. Fergus stares at her, then says quietly. She kisses him briefly with the gun at his temple and then goes, leaving Fergus standing in the darkness. Fergus, walking toward the hair salon with flowers in his hand, stands outside watching with the flowers behind his back. Then the chair turns, and we see it is Jude. Fergus freezes, seeing Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil. Jude, turning in the chair, smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and sees Jude is there. Fergus stands suddenly, throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog-marches her out.",
    "808": "They sit outside a cafe, while men watch them, and they smile. A waiter brings tea, and the old man eyes them stonily. Aisha looks at Ferris anxiously, then looks down. He leans to her, and she smiles slightly. They walk off as Marwan, dark-suited and imposing, approaches. Ferris pulls away from Marwan, and Aisha watches, concerned, as Marwan bundles Ferris into an SUV, which drives away with another SUV following. Aisha walks off. Ferris' brow is pinched as he is driven past the market square where a crowd watches a safe house burn, with golden flames bursting from the windows and rising from the roof. The SUV heads down a dark street, turns a corner, and stops near the burning safe house as a fire crew hoses the flames. Marwan and Ferris get out of the SUV, and Ferris steps closer to the blaze, holding his hand against his forehead. He squats down for a moment, then straightens up and turns to Marwan, who cocks his head back towards the SUV. The SUVs drive to waste-ground and park by a number of other vehicles with their headlights on, where men in dark suits stand around. Marwan shoves Ferris down a rubbish-strewn slope towards Hani, where one of Hani's agents, holding a gun, stands beside a figure kneeling with his head covered in a black hood and his wrists bound behind his back. Ferris and Hani face each other, and Ferris nods. Ferris watches Hani and his men, then looks at Skip with disdain, steps over, and leans down to him. Ferris punches and kicks Skip, who tumbles down the slope. Ferris spits at him and walks off, heading up the slope. Skip's hands remain tied behind his back. The white dome of the Capitol building rises up amongst the ordered grid of streets. Ferris sits alone at a cafe by a lake, drinking from a take-away coffee cup, as Hoffman walks over. Ferris kicks his chair over and Hoffman peers over his glasses at Ferris. A black SUV drives along a track through a forest and stops outside a house with two communications towers nearby. Ferris gets out of the SUV as a casually dressed, bespectacled man with light-brown hair walks up, smoking a cigarette. Ferris shakes hands with him and they smile, as Garland leads Ferris into the house while munching a strawberry. He leads Ferris through the large, cluttered living room where several computers are laid out on a table, and a parrot sits on a perch. Garland points at a screen and looks at photographs, then wrinkles his brow at Ferris. In a city of skyscrapers, cranes stand beside buildings under construction, which, without their glass cladding, resemble towering honeycombs. In a hotel room, Ferris rubs a towel over his wet hair then brushes on a foamy white solution.",
    "902": "One man sits splotch on, his head long back, trailing blood from two holes. Purvis stares, stunned, then opens a rear door. It's the G-men and gangster skirmishing. Homer runs the length of the barroom to a far window. John hustles downstairs, carrying two Tommy guns, hands one to Baby Face, and joins him at the barroom windows. Liquor bottles on the barroom wall explode. Upstairs Red and Johnny duck aside of their shattered windows and re-open fire. Agent Winstead takes his shots, and the wall chips above a guest room mirror. Purvis fires from behind the disabled car and peppers the plaster walls of Dillinger's room. We crouch between the gangsters in the second-story guest room, and our jerky view pivots from right to Dillinger. Outside FBI gunfire sprays a balcony. An adjacent window shows a gangster taking aim as the G-men resume firing. Agent Rice takes a shot in the leg. As Red delivers covering fire, Dillinger hustles to a guest room next door and butts a window with his gun. Dillinger and Red escape onto a rooftop and hop down to a dark yard at the other side of the launch. Now, in the barroom, a jerky close-up follows Baby Face, who backs up to a side door. Outside it opens and Baby Face fires towards the car. His shots send up clouds of dirt, but Purvis returns fire through the dust, splintering through the door. Inside, Baby Face flees past Homer and leaps through a bay window! As he runs off, Agent Pleg sees the criminal escaping. Purvis eyes Baum, who heads off. As Purvis shoots the side door, Homer fires back. Now, Baum dashes past Agents Clegg and Madala on his way to intercept the fugitive. Elsewhere, Dillinger and Red make their own escape through the woods. Winstead spots them, but they fail to notice him. Winstead and his partner move out in pursuit, now racing along a forested hillside with Red staying close behind Dillinger. A cloth sack dangles from Red's grip as both men hurry past a narrowed outcropping. Winstead and Hurt appear on the trail. As Dillinger and Red pass a misty overlook, the agents reach a stand of twin trees and split up, with Hurt taking to higher ground while Winstead advances on the trail. A view through the leafy canopy shows the criminals scurrying off. Winstead pitches his hat, sights the man, and fires. Dillinger retaliates. As Winstead dives into a roll, Dillinger's gun empties. Winstead kneels and opens fire. Red takes cover behind a tree, and Dillinger does the same. Winstead's shots clobber the trunk shielding Dillinger, who calmly reloads. His breath mists in the cold, night air as he leans out and fires.",
    "551": "Another Soldier leaps from the truck onto the tank and raises his knife as he grabs Indy. They struggle and fall. Indy sits up to see Vogel standing over him, who wraps a chain around Indy's neck. Indy appears at the entrance, the chain still wrapped about his neck and held by Vogel. Vogel pulls Indy from the tank entrance, yanking on the chain wrapped around his neck. A Nazi Soldier approaches, and Indy hits him, knocking him onto the tank tread. The Nazi Soldier screams as he is dragged under the rolling tank. Now Indy and Vogel struggle with one another, the chain still wrapped around Indy's neck. We see Indy and Vogel struggling atop the tank, and Indy lifts his feet, lunging toward the periscope and pulling Vogel with him. Indy's face is pressed up against the lens of the periscope. The Nazi Soldier looking through the periscope pulls away from it, smiles, then turns back to it. Indy's face, still pressed against the lens, is visible. Vogel pulls Indy from the periscope, and the Nazi Soldier pulls away from the periscope again. A troop truck pulls near the tank, and Henry fires the tank gun at the troop truck. Soldiers fly into the air, and the troop truck flips over and explodes. The explosion knocks Indy off the tank and onto the tread. He grabs onto the shredded gun protruding from the side of the tank. Vogel looks down at Indy and smiles smugly. The tank is approaching a cliff wall. As Indy tries to secure footing, Vogel steps on his hands. Brody looks at Henry. Vogel now swings a shovel at Indy, smashing at his hands. Brody climbs up out of the tank, followed by Henry. A Nazi Soldier appears and pulls Henry down. Vogel raises the shovel above his head and brings it crashing down on Indy, still hanging from the protruding gun. Indy loses his grip and now hangs from the gun suspended only by the strap of his leather pouch. He screams as the gun scrapes against the cliff wall, sending stones tumbling down over him. The Nazi Soldier knocks Henry into a pile of boxes, then punches him in the face. As the Soldier raises the gun to Henry's face, Brody hits him over the head with a canister. The Soldier falls, discharging the gun into the air. The bullet ricochets around the tank, past the Tank Driver who is manipulating levers at the control panel. Sparks fly; then the bullet pings against the window and ricochets once more, this time passing through the Tank Driver's hat. Blood flows from under the hat as the Tank Driver slumps forward, his body depressing the levers. Indy still hangs from the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, barely missing the rocks and causing Vogel to fall.",
    "801": "He walks into Aisha's apartment and looks around, his face aglow with sweat. He goes into the living room. The TV is on. He tests the temperature of a pot of tea. Holding his gun, Ferris walks along the hall and goes into the kitchen. He sees a streak of blood on the side of a worktop and touches it. Ferris rubs the dark, sticky substance between his fingers. He walks out onto the balcony and makes a phone call. Marwan sits alone in a restaurant. Ferris walks up and two bodyguards stop him. Marwan goes to Hani. Hani leaves his attractive female companion and walks off with Ferris. They stand facing each other. Edgy, Ferris steps right up to Hani. Hani walks off. Marwan stops Ferris' firing. At an airport, a hangar door opens. Holding Aisha's phone, Ferris runs over to a small jet. Hoffman gets off with a bag slung on his shoulder. A message appears on the phone. There's a long phone number. Ferris makes the call. Ferris is dropped off in a village. A van rolls up. The driver gets out and opens the back. Ferris climbs in beneath the back seats and lies in the storage area. The driver, with thick stubble and cap, puts on a tape as he drives off. A bright golden sun shines across the desert. The van follows a line of cars and slows up. A soldier stands with an Alsatian. Another sits in the turret of a tank. A soldier waves the van over. The driver glances behind him. The soldier checks the driver's papers. Dar'a, Syria. The van drives through the desert, passing nomads with two camels. A golden sun hangs above mountains in the distance. The van travels across the barren and scorched land leaving a trail of dust. Viewed from the surveillance camera, the van is a dot on an expanse of light brown earth. The van stops. The driver opens the back. Sunlight floods in. Ferris hauls himself out. The driver beckons to him. The driver gets in the van and leaves. Ferris paces. Flat, golden, dusty earth dotted with small bushes stretches for miles. Clutching Aisha's phone, Ferris squats down and looks up into the clear blue sky. He runs his hand across his sweaty face. Hoffman is in the surveillance room, viewing Ferris from above. Ferris wanders across the dirt. Four SUVs appear and drive towards him. He stares at them. Ferris looks at the sky and puts his hands up. The team watch the surveillance screen. The SUVs drive in a circle around Ferris churning up a dust cloud, obscuring them. Men get out of the SUVs and go up to Ferris.",
    "1269": "Neville swings the sword of Gryffindor as a cloud of black smoke rises, cradling Hermione in the rubble, while the power fades in the Elder Wand. In the courtyard, Voldemort reels, and Harry turns to face him, prompting the Dark Lord's face to fill with fury. Red and green blasts meet in a brilliant white and orange glow as Harry presses forward, forcing Voldemort back as the energy from the Elder Wand dissipates and dies. Harry flicks his wand, sending the Elder Wand cartwheeling through the air across the courtyard, causing Voldemort to fall forwards as pieces of his skull break away. With his mouth gaping in horror, he looks up as his body and clothes disintegrate into thousands of tiny pieces that float upwards, and the morning sun shimmers through the mountains and Voldemort as they drift like ashes from a paper fire. Inside, exhausted students sit on the stairs, with Neville still holding the sword of Gryffindor, smiling as Luna sits down coyly beside him. Harry, holding a mug, wanders aimlessly through the Great Hall, congealed blood under his right nostril and bottom lip, and smiles when he sees the Weasley family together. He walks past chattering students, receives a weak smile from Cho Chang, and sees Aberforth chatting to Dean and Seamus. Harry stops in front of Hagrid, who hugs him and then studies him, causing Harry to grin as Hagrid turns and walks away. Filch makes a vain attempt to sweep up a mountain of rubble as Hermione and Ron walk into the Hall, causing Harry to smile when he notices they are holding hands and Hermione glances down coyly. Outside in brilliant sunshine, the three friends stroll aimlessly along the ruined bridge, and Harry steps up onto a broken stone support to look out, nodding to himself with the Elder Wand in his right hand. As Harry toys with it and studies it closely, he holds it horizontally in both hands. Hermione glances at Ron, and they exchange a look as Harry snaps the wand in two and flings both parts off the bridge into the chasm below. He nods to himself again and turns to the others before jumping down onto the bridge and walking away from them, with Hermione and Ron turning to watch him. He glances back at them, and Hermione strides up to Harry and takes his hand, looking at him admiringly, while Ron follows her and stands on her other side. She looks down and takes Ron's hand, and they stand on the rubble-strewn bridge with the ruined school behind them, gazing ahead. At St. Pancras Hotel, a grand building with a clock tower, inside nearby King's Cross Station, a dark-haired boy of 11 wearing a striped shirt wheels a trolley piled with luggage and an animal cage along a platform.",
    "644": "Jamal gulps his drink down quickly as the inspector makes to leave the room. Outside Javed's luxurious house, Jamal sees through the windows that much of the furniture has been removed and bangs his head on the door in frustration as the inspector leaves. Jamal looks down at the ground, exhausted. On TV, a news report shows, and Salim and Latika glance at each other and then back at the TV, where a livid scar is revealed along Latika's cheekbone. In the room with Jamal are a number of girls, thugs, and Javed, and Latika sees Jamal on the TV. Javed snatches the remote control and changes the channel, gesturing for the girls to dance. Latika leaves the room and Salim notices she's gone as scantily clad girls flood in with the thugs. A girl tries to dance with Javed while he's on the phone, but he bats her away and moves to a quieter room. Salim watches the girls cavorting with no interest, leaves, and joins Latika next door. Latika wipes tears from her face as Salim walks over and holds out a set of keys, which she takes. He shakes his head, takes out his phone, dials a number, then closes the phone and hands it to her, gently stroking her cheek near the scar. He holds the door open for her and closes it behind her as she dashes towards his car. Salim walks back to the main room where Javed is still on the phone. Latika starts the car as Srinivas throws water on a dozing Jamal. Latika drives at a high speed on packed roads as crowds cheer outside the studio where Jamal arrives in a police van with cameras flashing. Latika slows down as she hits major traffic jams in a gridlocked road while studio lights come on as technicians assemble equipment. An old woman sees Jamal in the van as the crowd begins to gather and people start to cheer, with people all over the country gathering in front of TVs to watch. Latika sits in her car in traffic as crowds stand outside electrical goods shops watching the show on TVs in the windows and an entire family has gathered to have supper in front of the TV. The main room at the Excel Five Call Center is virtually empty as a manager walks in, seeing the TV room packed with staff watching Jamal appear on the screen. In the studio, as the host leads Jamal to his chair, Latika decides to dump the car and walk. Latika stops outside the electronics shop and joins the crowd watching Jamal on the screen, as Jamal smiles, recollecting his teacher beating him with the book and sheltering from the rain as a child, saying she could be the third musketeer.",
    "388": "Quintana looks at Walter, and Jesus walks away as Walter nods sadly. We are looking down at the Dude who is prone on the rug, his eyes closed, wearing a Walkman headset. The Dude absently licks his lips as we faintly hear a hall rumbling down the lane. In his outflung hand lies a cassette case labeled VENICE. On its impact with the pins, the Dude opens his eyes, and a blonde woman looms over him. Next to her, a young man in paint-spattered denims stoops and swings something towards the carrier as a million stars explode against a field of black. The Dude is flying over the city, his arms thrown out in front of him, the wind whipping his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. Ahead, the mysterious blonde woman wings away, riding on the Dude's rug like a sheik on a magic carpet. She is outpacing us, growing smaller, and he looks up. The Dude does a couple of lazy crawl strokes and then notices that a bowling ball has materialized in his forward hand. His bemusement turns to concern over the aerodynamic implications just as the ball seems to suddenly assume its weight, abruptly snapping his arm down, and him after it. He is falling, and from a high angle, we see the Dude hurtling down toward the city, dragged by the ball. A reverse looking up shows the Dude hurtling toward us out of the inky sky, his eyes wide with horror. Led by the bowling ball, he zooms past the camera leaving us in black as dull reflections materialize in the darkness. They are glints off the shiny surface of an oncoming bowling ball. We pull back to reveal that the blackness was the inside of a ball return, and the gleaming bowling ball is being regurgitated up at us, overtaking us. The Dude looks up, up, up at the looming ball, its mass rolling a huge shadow across his face. The gleaming ball shows three dead black holes rolling toward us--finger holes--and the largest--thumb--hole rolls directly over us, engulfing us once again in black. The black rolls away and we are spinning--spinning down a bowling lane--our point of view that of someone trapped in the thumbhole of the rolling ball. We see the receding bowler spinning away; it is the blonde woman, performing her follow-through. Floor spins up at us and then away; ceiling spins up and away; the length of the alley with pins at the end; floor; ceiling; approaching pins; again and again. We hit the pins and clatter into blackness as we see pins spin, hit each other, and drop. They come from the Dude's Walkman, the headset of which is now askew, with one arm off his ear.",
    "815": "Rebecca notices a loose thread on her jacket and tears the sleeve. Alicia approaches Alette, while Rebecca, with her hair crimped, runs to a side table and tries to hide the tear using a canapé. As two women emerge from the powder room, Rebecca dives for the door, but her jacket catches on it, and beads tumble to the floor, causing her to fall into the arms of one of the women drinking champagne, who loses her balance. The jacket is pulled off Rebecca, who then assists the woman to her seat. Later, Rebecca is in the kitchen and, wearing a dress that resembles a waitress uniform, is pushed into the ballroom with a tray of food. Trying to return to the kitchen, a stern manager hisses at her, causing her to face Alette's table. She twirls around, bumps into a waiter, and sends fish flying. Luke stands up, takes Rebecca's trays, and Alicia purses her lips while Alette giggles. Later, on a romantically lit rooftop, Luke places his tuxedo around Rebecca's shoulders, gives her an enigmatic sideways glance, and they kiss. The next morning, Rebecca arrives at work in a red dress, with a fluffy orange shrug and swinging a matching orange bag, smiling softly as she rides the escalator. A man in a gray coat is on a lower escalator. She walks away coolly, bursts into a run, dives into a lift, and a black briefcase blocks the closing doors as Derek Smeath enters. Standing on the other side of the lift, she surreptitiously observes him: dark hair, pale complexion, glasses, gray raincoat. The lift stops at the Dantay-West Publications floor, a number of people exit, and Smeath glances at her, as more people board. She looks at his sturdy black briefcase, takes out her phone, and scrolls past Bergdorf, Bloomingdale's, and Chanel to Derek Smeath. She phones him, flashes a smile at a man entering the lift, but quickly cancels the call and puts the phone back in her bag. In horror, she rummages in her bag as the lift reaches Trout and Bass on the fifth floor, and she flees, glancing back as Smeath looks up and their eyes meet. He smiles slowly and smugly, and she dashes for the stairs, running through an office door as Smeath exits the lift. Rebecca freezes as Smeath is forcibly removed, and she watches him disappear, her tense smile relaxing. Finally, Alette's chauffeur-driven car arrives at a store.",
    "440": "He picks up a bottle. There is murder in his eyes. The proprietor is completely under the spell of that terrible glance. He hands over the bottle. Don takes it and walks out. Don enters, looks around the apartment, which is still in utter disorder. The electric lights, burning on heedlessly, offend him and he snaps off the light switch. Don, not noticing, walks to his big chair. On the small table next to it stand the three empty bottles. He takes the new bottle from his pocket and, sinking into the big chair, starts opening it. On the desk behind him, the telephone starts ringing. He sweeps them to the floor. Without winking an eyelash, he pours his glass half full, lifts it so that glass and hand obscure his face. In the dark sits Don, passed out. He opens his eyes, still in a half-stupor, stares straight before him. The bottle next to him is four-fifths empty. Out of the corner of one eye he sees something and slowly and with difficulty turns his head. In the wall above the couch, close to the door, there is a hole in the plaster, as if left by a large nail carelessly withdrawn so that some of the plaster went with it. Out of the hole peers a small mouse. At first Don draws back, repelled, but the mouse is such a friendly, harmless creature that after a moment his face relaxes and he half smiles at it. Just as he does so, from the direction of the window there whirs past him a strange winged thing. It is a bat, swooping in slow loops around the room. Don crouches into the back of his chair, staring in wild distaste. The top of the bat's hooked wing nicks his forehead as it speeds in swift but fluttering flight straight at the mouse. Don stiffens against the back of his chair. The bat has made another swoop and spread its wings over the mouse. Beneath those black wings some hideous pygmy struggle is going on. Apparently the bat has seized the mouse in its claws. Don gives a cry of horror. Now from behind the struggling wings comes a spurt of blood. Don cries out so hard his throat seems to burst apart, buries his horrified eyes in the back of his chair. She must have been listening from Don's first scream. Sophie, standing beside her, is barking wildly. From downstairs comes the barking of Mrs. Deveridge's dog. Beyond her, the door to her apartment is open. Don still cowers in his chair, his face hidden in his arms, his breathing heavy with terror. From outside comes the sound of footsteps racing upstairs toward his door, then the doorbell: short, short, long short.",
    "295": "Thorwald is at the door, unlocking it with his key. Lisa dashes back into the bedroom just in time to avoid being seen by Thorwald as he opens the door and enters the apartment. Stella is staring out, tense and frightened, while a policeman on the phone repeats with irritation. Her expression changes sharply as she glances slightly to the left. The first policeman indicates that Lisa is to come with him and pauses momentarily to tell the second policeman to take a statement from Thorwald about the attempted burglary. The second policeman reaches for the jewelry in Thorwald’s hand and takes it for examination. During a brief pause while the two policemen speak, Lisa starts waving her left hand behind her back. Jeff is looking through his camera, and Lisa stops waving and holds her fingers spread out, pointing to the wedding ring on her left hand. The lens pans upward and across, bringing Thorwald's profile into view as he looks down at Lisa's hands. He then slowly turns his head and looks directly into the lens, suddenly realizing that Lisa is signaling someone who is watching him. Jeff drops the camera into his lap as Stella hurries from the window, turning off lights, while Jeff backs his chair into the room. As Thorwald's attention is drawn back to the second policeman to answer further questions, the first policeman takes Lisa by the arm and leads her out of the apartment. Jeff points to a drawer in the wall cabinets, and Stella moves to get it. She finds a billfold and hands it to Jeff, who takes it, extracts some bills, and begins counting the money. He looks up sharply at Stella, then returns to counting as she comments. Jeff does, as Stella gets her purse. Thorwald leaves his apartment and proceeds down the corridor. Stella goes up to the door, and Jeff grabs it, picking it up. Stella pauses, and he hangs up just as Jeff looks toward Thorwald's apartment, puzzled by what he sees. Thorwald's apartment is completely dark, but Thorwald steps to the top of the stairs and is somewhat visible. Jeff still doesn't speak and moves forward a couple of steps. He grips the flash holder more tightly, lifting it slightly as if prepared to use it. Thorwald advances to the middle of the room, eyes on Jeff and hands clenching as he tries to control his anger.",
    "177": "The POV moves from the Jack-O-Lantern down to another window and peers inside, where the boyfriend grabs the sister and kisses her. Into the bedroom comes the sister, 18, very pretty, as Alan, 18, wearing a Halloween mask and a costume, enters. She giggles as the boyfriend jumps into the room. The boyfriend rips off his mask, revealing a handsome young man underneath, and they kiss again with more passion as she responds to him. The POV swings away from the window, pacing restlessly and agitated, and then springs back from the window, quickly stalking down the side of the house, past the Jack-O-Lantern, to a door, which is quickly opened as the POV moves inside. The POV glides silently through the house into the kitchen, up to a drawer, which is opened, and a large butcher knife is withdrawn. The POV swings around and moves to the kitchen door, looking down a hallway to the front door. The boyfriend is seen stepping out of the bedroom door, buttoning his shirt. Slowly, the POV moves into the room, focusing on the discarded Halloween mask on the floor, bending down to pick it up, then suddenly covering the POV with the mask through the eye-holes. The POV moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door, peering inside where the sister sits at her night-table brushing her hair, still completely nude. The POV moves up behind the sister, and sensing a presence, she spins around, staring at the POV and covering her breasts quickly. Suddenly, the POV lunges forward as the sister continues to stare incredulously, and there is a rapid blur as the POV drives the butcher knife into the sister's chest and out again almost before it's seen. In a wild paroxysm, the butcher knife blurs in and out of frame, slashing the sister mercilessly as she begins to scream, tries to fend off the blows with her hands, then suddenly falls out of frame to the floor. The POV moves back away from the sister's lifeless body, spins around, and careens out of the bedroom at top speed, racing through the darkened house to the front door, out the door, down the steps, and rapidly up the street. The camera careens along in frenzied flight, up the sidewalk, up a small side alley, down someone's backyard, then comes to a sudden, abrupt halt in front of Mother and Father just coming out of a neighbor's house. The father's hand reaches up and rips off the Halloween mask, revealing Michael, 6, underneath, a bright-eyed boy with a calm, quiet smile on his face.",
    "1090": "Tuvia's hardened eyes flicker as he looks up at Aron and the people he has brought, some of whom are biting hungrily on mounds of hard bread, while Zus stands nearby looking uneasy and beckons to his older brother to join him out of earshot of the others. Tuvia sets off, leaving Zus looking unconvinced. In a dimly lit cottage, Tuvia pours out two vodkas as a dark-haired Russian sits down at his table, places a gun on the table, and Tuvia takes it, glancing at the wife's hostile face, pocketing the bullets, and tucking the gun into his belt. The wife is chopping meat while the men clink glasses, pour some away, and down the rest. Tuvia bites into a piece of bread, and the wife ignores him as Tuvia cracks a smile. A beam of light shines through the window as Tuvia dives out of the back door, and the wife quickly removes the glasses from the table. Tuvia climbs up into Koscik's barn, where half a dozen people are already hiding, as an official car draws up with its headlights blazing. Outside, Koscik is holding the vodka bottle. Koscik hands over the bottle, gulps back some vodka, and someone coughs in the barn as Bernicki passes the bottle to a colleague. In the barn, Tuvia takes out the gun and gulps back some more vodka. Bielski's eyes bulge, and he holds a finger at Koscik's head like a pistol, pats Koscik on the cheek, and goes. Bernicki and the two young men with him return to their car as Tuvia, in the barn, sighs with relief. Outside, Koscik hands out clothing to the Jews who were hiding, and Tuvia watches uneasily as Koscik gives him a bottle and a loaf of rye bread, looking at Tuvia with compassion and nodding. The two friends shake hands, and Tuvia strides past the little group of Jews who watch him uncertainly, he glances over his shoulder without slowing down, and they hurry after him in the forest. Early the next morning, one of the Jews comes up behind Tuvia, and a guy in a smart hat and coat leans against a tree to get his breath back. Later, the extended group is having a meal as a girl bites into a piece of fruit and passes it to her neighbor, and the woman in the beret takes a ladle full of soup and passes the pot to Shimon, the school teacher, who takes a ladle full and passes it to Aron who sits next to Asael. Zus is chopping at a tree as Tuvia, standing nearby, sees the old man burying his daughter. Zus ties some rope and goes, while Tuvia walks up a leafy slope towards the old man filling the grave with earth.",
    "461": "The Kid looks the same, pale and weak, but maybe he's gripping the sheets a little too tightly with his hands. His Grandfather says nothing, just waits. We're back in the boat. Buttercup is treading water. And we're back where we were at the last moment we saw her, Buttercup frozen, the Shrieking Eel, jaws wide, about to clamp down as we see a giant arm pounding the Eel unconscious in one move, then easily lifting Buttercup. The boat and Fezzik, with Buttercup being deposited on the deck. Inigo points behind them. Vizzini ties Buttercup's hands. The boat at dawn is being followed closely by the black sailboat, which we can see for the first time is being sailed by a Man in Black, and his boat almost seems to be flying. And once he's said the name, they rise straight up, sheer from the water, impossibly high, in a wild race for the Cliffs, and the Man in Black is closing faster than ever, but not fast enough, the lead was too great to overcome, and as Inigo sails with great precision straight at the Cliffs, Fezzik reaches up along the cliff face, grabs a jutting rock, reaches behind it. Suddenly there is a thick rope in his hands. He drops back to the boat, gives the rope a freeing swing, and the rope goes all the way to the top. He straps a harness to him, then lifts Buttercup and Vizzini in the harness. Finally, he himself gets in the harness. All three are strapped to Fezzik like papooses, and he starts to ascend the rope, carrying them all along with him as he goes. The Man in Black is sailing in toward the Cliffs of Insanity, watching as Fezzik rises swiftly through the first moments of dawn. Fezzik's group is only faintly visible far below. This is the first time we've gotten the real vertigo feeling, and it's a gasper. Fezzik climbing on. Buttercup is almost out of her mind with fear. Fezzik is moving right along; however high they are, he's already over a third of the way done. The Man in Black leaps from his ship to the rope, starting to climb. He's impossibly far behind, but the way he goes you'd think he didn't know that because he is flying up the rope, hand over hand like lightning. He prods Fezzik, who nods, and increases his pace. The Man in Black is roaring up the rope, cutting deeply into Fezzik's lead, and his arms begin moving much more slowly. Vizzini and the others are getting too close now. The Man in Black is less than a hundred feet behind them. Vizzini leaps off, takes out a knife, and begins to cut the rope, which is tied around a great rock, while Inigo helps the Princess to her feet and Fezzik just stands around, waiting for someone to tell him to do something.",

Xenophilius moves from the window and finds a piece of paper. He takes a pen and draws a vertical straight line. He looks up, brushing back his long, straggly hair. Next, he draws a circle which contains the bottom half of the wand. Finally, he draws a triangle, surrounding the wand and the stone. Harry nods. Hermione looks anxious. He examines the teapot. He scuttles down the spiral staircase. Ron picks up his rucksack. They find Xenophilius by a window, muttering to himself. He rushes to the front door. He holds it shut. Looking desperate, he turns and faces them. They stare at him blankly. His hand over his heart, Xenophilius approaches Harry. He pushes the hair back from Harry's forehead, revealing the jagged scar. He fixes his eyes on Harry. Death eaters hurtle through the sky towards the house. Harry, Hermione, and Ron throw themselves to the floor. Flashes ricochet off the building as Xenophilius runs outside. Xenophilius is hit and falls to the ground. In the house, the three friends clasp hands and disapparate. The house is destroyed. They apparate in a forest. Ron walks past Hermione. He stops as a man stands up in front of him. Three others appear. Scabior, the Snatcher who smelled Hermione's perfume, leans against a tree. She turns and runs. Leaving their bags behind, Ron and Harry follow her. Half a dozen Snatchers set off in pursuit. Scabior joins the chase. The Snatchers fire with their wands and start gaining on them. Harry glances behind, trips, and falls. He scrambles to his feet. Scabior is chasing Hermione. A Snatcher aims his wand at Ron. It extends with a chain which winds itself around Ron's legs, tripping him up and binding his ankles together. A young Snatcher is in close pursuit of Harry. Harry ducks under a fallen tree. A Snatcher leaps down in front of him. Harry stumbles. He recovers and runs on. A chain loops around a tree close to Hermione. She fires an explosive from her wand, sending a Snatcher to the forest floor. Another appears in front of her. She turns and aims her wand at Harry. He falls heavily. The young thief.

    "749": "She moves away from the door with a slow, unhurried pace and bursts through the bathroom door, finding Celia sitting in a pool of blood. Hastily picking up the fallen towel rack, Minnie calmly takes in the situation, pulls the counterpane over Celia who is laying down in her bed, and presses a wet cloth to Celia's neck. Minnie's encouraging expression fades as Celia's face crumples in a tearful grimace. Outside in her garden, Celia has dug a hole in the lawn, places a small square cardboard box into the hole, and starts to fill it with earth. Just in front of her, there are two rose bushes, each in its own brick-lined flower bed, and with the hole almost filled, she reaches for a third rose bush and places it into the hole. Out on the street, the yellow and green bus doors open and a stream of maids stepped down, with the last to emerge being Yule Mae and Aibileen. A police officer handcuffs Yule Mae, and Aibileen is pushed back against the side of the bus as Yule Mae is strung armed away, her face pushed down onto the bonnet of a police car, one of the men cautions her. Aibileen witnesses white mothers and their children turned away with studded indifference, and Hilly sits in her car with her son, her face impassive. Skeeter is at the counter in the diner as Hilly comes in, parks her son in one of the booths, and Henry, behind the counter, leans into Skeeter with his wise dark eyes peering at her through his owl-like glasses. She rushes over to Aibileen, finding the living room full of maids who all turn to look at her with their somber smooth-skinned faces as Aibileen beckons to her. Her eyes brimming with tears, she steps into the center of the room as a white-haired woman tells her story. Miss Tine, having lunch with two male colleagues in a swanky restaurant, is on the phone to Skeeter. An orange cruiser pulls into Elizabeth drive where the bridge launches in full swing as Mary Beth takes Skeeter's place at Hilly's table. Celia, wearing a low-cut fitted plum top over a tight pink skirt, sachets up the garden path carrying a pie. Elizabeth glances towards the door and Hilly's jaw drops, but Hilly takes control and ducks out of sight. At the front of the house, Celia sees a gap in the curtains and gives a cheery smile, which Hilly sees, causing Celia's friendly smile to fade. She retreats, taking her pie with her as Aibileen watches her humiliation from the doorway to the kitchen. On the way to her car, Celia fights back her tears, and back at home, Minnie looks at her like a mother talking to a small child who's just been bullied.",
    "658": "He's nowhere to be seen as they all troop into his room. Norman comes further in. Peter's clinging to the ceiling. Still in costume, he notices blood trickling down his arm, ready to drop. The others leave Norman in Peter's room. As he turns to walk out, the drop of blood falls to the floor. Norman's enhanced hearing picks up the sound of the drop hitting the floor. He looks around, spots the blood, then raises his eyes to the ceiling. Peter has gone. Norman screws up his eyes and heads for the open window. Norman leans over the balcony and looks down and up. Later, out of costume, Peter walks through the front door. Norman is sitting at the head of the table and Peter opposite MJ and Harry. Aunt May set an enormous turkey in front of Norman. Norman's picking at the sweet potatoes. Norman licks his fingers and looks malevolently at the white haired Aunt May. He picks up the carving knife and begins to sharpen it, a sneer on his face. Aunt May notices blood seeping through Peter's shirt. Norman glares at him. Norman is holding the carving knife, blade pointing at Peter. He lays it down and rises from the table. Harry races out after his father. Everyone has heard the conversation through the open door. MJ lowers her head. Peter glances at her as a dejected Harry comes back into the room. Norman's in his living room. He talks to the Goblin mask. Aunt May's in her bedroom. The explosion rips out the wall. The Green Goblin glides in. Aunt May is lying on the floor, leaning against her bed. Later, Peter rushes into the hospital. He runs to her room. Peter is pushed out of the room. He leans against the corridor wall, deep in thought. Peter's bright blue eyes twitch nervously. He looks one way down the corridor, and then turns to look the other way. Now he sits by his aunt's bedside. She's sedated. The young man takes his aunt's hand in his and gently strokes it with his thumb. On the bedside cabinet is a framed photograph of her, Uncle Ben, and Peter. Peter studies it grimly. He shifts his gaze back onto his aunt and swallows, before speaking. The next day, MJ comes to visit. There's flowers. The young red-head looks down at the peaceful figure on the bed. The two are sitting opposite each other. He's staring straight into her eyes. She smiles a little. Peter averts his gaze, nods his head, then looks down at the floor. Unknown to them, Aunt May's eyes are open. She's overheard. She smiles, then closes her eyes again. MJ reaches out and gently takes hold of Peter's hand.",
    "330": "Gandalf rises to his full height, his eyes flash, his shadow suddenly seems to fill the room. Bilbo lifts his knapsack and heads for the front door. Bilbo pulls out the ring and stares at it in his palm. With all his willpower, Bilbo allows the ring to slowly slide off his palm and drop to the floor. The tiny ring lands with a heavy thud on the wooden floor. Bilbo staggers out of Bag End and braces himself in the night air, pale and trembling, as if his loss of the ring has weakened him. Gandalf steps up behind. The ring is glinting on the floor, and Gandalf circles around it, a puzzled look on his face. Gandalf slowly reaches for the ring. Gandalf is sitting in front of the fire with his pipe, staring into the flickering flames. Frodo rushes into Bag End and stops to pick up the ring at his feet. Gandalf continues staring into the fire, as if locked in thought. Gandalf turns, his eyes locking onto the ring in Frodo's fingers. Gandalf holds out the envelope and Frodo drops the ring into it. Gandalf seals the envelope with wax and hands it to Frodo. Gandalf is already at the door and turns to Frodo. Gandalf hurries out the door, leaving Frodo standing alone in Bag End. The camera pushes in, and the hum of the ring comes up on the soundtrack. The camera pushes through the white paper to the ring, beneath which the whispered murmur of Black Speech can be heard. The huge dark tower of Barad-dûr is being rebuilt. Thousands of orcs crawl over the surface, hauling stone and iron up the towering heights, which grows and spreads across the red-streaked sky, casting a shadowy pall over the nightmarish landscape. Nine Black Riders burst out of Minas Morgul and charge toward the camera. A lone horseman gallops to the crest of a hill on the west road. On the main highway south to Minas Tirith, he looks toward the saw-toothed mountains of Mordor. He is seeping out across the blood-red sky, his face grave. He spurs his horse on, making his way down into the lower depths of the citadel. Pages flip as Gandalf searches ancient scrolls and books placed high on a wooden table. His eyes settle on one old parchment. He murmurs hurriedly to himself, reading. Farmer Maggot is chopping wood in his garden. Snorting horse nostrils as the shadow of a black rider looms over a Hobbit house. Terrified, Farmer Maggot cowers in his doorway, and Fang, his dog, whimpers and backs away. The black rider gallops away at speed. Frodo farewells Sam outside Bag End and heads towards the front door. A creepy point of view from inside Bag End shows Frodo coming up the path. Frodo enters Bag End and immediately pauses, sensing that something is amiss.",
    "1176": "They sheath their swords and join the black chess pieces. Ron climbs onto the stone horse of the black knight and looks across the board as a white pawn moves itself forward. Hermione looks at Ron anxiously, and obeying Ron's instructions, a black pawn moves forward and is sliced off by the white pawn. The game gets underway; a white bishop explodes, a white knight hits the dust, and a black pawn is destroyed. A white bishop and a white knight explode, and the white queen attacks a black castle, which explodes in a shower of stone fragments and collapses in a pile of rubble. The queen turns triumphantly. Ron contemplates his next move, and watching the merciless white queen, Harry suddenly understands the game that Ron is playing and nods. Taking a deep breath, Ron clutches the horse's reins, closes his eyes, and the black horse starts to move across the board between the remains of the shattered stone chess pieces. Ron looks nervously at the white king, who wears a silver helmet, clasping a powerful sword with his hands encased in metal armor. Ron braces himself as the white queen slowly turns and moves steadily across the board, heading straight towards Ron's black horse. He clings onto the reins, shaking with fear, as the queen gets closer and closer, gliding over the smooth marble floor. She stabs the black horse, causing Ron to fall off, and the horse crashes beside him. Hermione steps hurriedly back onto her square and looks anxiously towards Ron, who is lying unconscious. Harry moves into the winning position and confidently looks up at the white king, whose huge sword falls from his hands and lies on the marble floor at Harry's feet. He and Hermione run to Ron and kneel beside him. Harry gets to his feet, and still kneeling beside Ron, Hermione watches him go. Outside the chess room, Harry walks cautiously down a flight of white dimly lit stone steps. As he descends the stairs, he touches the scar on his forehead and sees a figure wearing a turban looking into the Mirror of Erised, Professor Quirrell. Harry touches his scar as Quirrell stares into it and stretches out his hand, drawing Harry reluctantly towards him. Harry looks into the Mirror of Erised and stares at his reflection, which stares back at him, then puts its hand in its pocket, takes out a red stone, winks at Harry, shows him the stone, and puts it back in its pocket. Secretly, Harry feels in his own pocket and finds something there. Quirrell looks impatient as Harry backs away, standing with his back to the mirror, and Quirrell unwinds the turban from his head.",
    "1276": "They stare in horror at the gaping drop ahead of them as a hand tosses up a wand, then a second hand appears, and finally, Neville's head, as he pulls himself up. An army of Dementors, Death Eaters, and Giants make their way towards the school from the other side. Flitwick backs away between ranks of the Stone Army as a Giant approaches, but vines strip up the giant and pin him to the ground. Death Eaters swoop down, aiming blasts of green light at the Stone Warriors, while two bold giants swing between pronged weapons and knock people flying, plowing through the Stone Army in pursuit of the tinny Professor Flitwick. An explosion rips through the courtyard, and people run for cover as parts of the school are ablaze. Death Eaters burst into a tower, and Arthur Weasley fends one of them off while Kingsley Shacklebolt suspends another in midair, then sends him flying back out of the window. Hurrying down the stairs, Harry turns and propels a third Death Eater before continuing down the stairs. Neville sprints off, and amidst the mayhem, Ginny and Harry kiss before she runs upstairs. Draco grabs two cronies and frog marches Blaise and Goyle away. Harry runs along a corridor where the roof is collapsing, avoiding the falling rubble, and stops suddenly as he reaches a black stone wall—the entrance to the Room of Requirement. He concentrates as Ron studies the Marauder's Map, looks up from the map, and stares ahead wide-eyed. Draco sees the entrance door to the Room of Requirement, turns to his cronies, and as they run towards the door, it disappears and becomes a blank wall again. Inside, Harry sees a cavernous storeroom stacked high with furniture and junk, making his way deeper into the room along the aisles between the stacks, roving around as he continues searching the vast space, passing books, statues, gold, and silver ornaments, striding at a breathtaking pace. A winged blue Pixie watches him from high up on the top of a gold picture frame and flutters lower to get a closer look. Harry stops and listens, turns around, and gazes back the way he came. He walks very slowly and deliberately, drawn towards a clothed table piled high with bric-a-brac, moving a coil silk rope aside to find a plain wooden casket. He pulls the casket forward, unfastens it, and opens the lid to reveal the diadem, a silver tiara in the shape of a raven with a huge blue stone in its center, and another stone hanging from it in the shape of a tear. Blaise glances across at Goyle, and the spells collide, with the diadem thrown into the air.",
    "866": "The letter is addressed to Marius, and Eponine opens it, reads it, and looks distressed. Rain pours down, soaking the cobbled street as Eponine slowly walks through the darkness, soaked to the skin. Student protesters and townspeople line a street by the Place de la Bastille, while Gavroche and the urchins are in the elephant. Soldiers march down the street followed by cavalry, with the large black hearse for General Lamarque behind them. Enjolras waves a red flag and climbs onto the street, joined by Marius and the others. Javert is in the crowd as the cavalry face the protesters, who are grouped around the hearse. Enjolras and Marius cock pistols as soldiers raise their swords and aim their muskets. A soldier shoots into the crowd, hitting a woman who collapses. Cavalry charges, and men exchange fire with the soldiers. Enjolras shoots as one of the students, Courfeyrac, is knocked down, but Javert, dressed as a civilian, helps him up. Marius rides down the street as a cart is overturned and furniture is thrown from windows to build the barricade. A cannon is pulled into place, and students shoot from behind the barricade. People with guns chase the cavalry down the street, and protesters run through the streets. Marius finds a canoodling couple as a table is taken, and he beams with excitement while Courfeyrac calls out. Tables and pianos are thrown from windows. In a cafe, Javert steals a rosette and pins it to his dark jacket. A couch and a cart form the barricade, which blocks the street, and an old woman is kissed as her chair is taken. Javert takes a pistol. A red flag is thrown to Marius, and Enjolras climbs onto the top of the barricade and waves the flag while people wave tricolors from their windows. Javert returns, and they raise their weapons. Javert throws off the men holding him and lays a few punches, but the students overwhelm him as Enjolras knocks him out with a club. Enjolras and Marius look around with concern, grab their weapons, and head to the barricade with the group. A woman closes her shutters, and the students man the barricade and aim their weapons. A platoon of soldiers marches up the street to face them as light flickers on Enjolras's face and sparking gunpowder lights up the street. Students return fire as soldiers climb up the barricade and shoot through it, leaving a soldier dead on top. Marius grabs a barrel of gunpowder, which flames up, and Gavroche calls out. Eponine is behind the barricade and grabs a musket aimed at Marius, getting shot in the process. Marius has a torch and lowers the flaming torch towards the gunpowder. The officer turns to his men, who back away. Breathless, Enjolras takes the torch from Marius.",
    "1189": "Buckbeak lifts his head, opens his beak, and grabs a bat. The bats fly out into the open and swoop low over Harry and Hermione's heads, and they look back towards the hippogriff. In the distance, they see again the dog and the werewolf fighting by the willow tree, and Harry and Hermione run through the undergrowth. Ahead of them, the werewolf flings the dog against the rock, and Harry sees himself throwing a stone and the werewolf turning and advancing on him. Hermione howls as they race back the way they came through the moonlit forest, stumbling over the uneven ground. Close behind, the savage werewolf lopes easily after them, and Harry trips over a tree root, but Hermione helps him up. Eventually, they stop to catch their breath, hiding behind the gnarled trunk of a huge tree. The werewolf sniffs the ground and then disappears around the other side of the tree, and they look around cautiously before creeping away nervously. The vicious creature appears behind them; it moves forward and rears up, about to strike. Flapping his huge wings, Buckbeak attacks, claws the werewolf with his talons, and it slinks away. Hermione hides her face on Harry's shoulder as a blast of air scatters the dry leaves at their feet. They look up to see a swarm of Dementors moving ominously across the sky, and holding Hermione's hand, Harry leads the way towards the lake. On the stony shore at the far side, he sees himself and Sirius lying unconscious beside him, while the hooded Dementors fly low over the frozen lake and swoop down again and again as they attack the two helpless figures. The Dementors hover above Sirius as Harry runs out from the trees. Standing at the edge of the lake, he points his wand, summoning all his strength, and the wand pulsates with energy and a silver mist comes from it, forcing the Dementors back. The light from the wand glows even more strongly, forming a bright protective shield which spreads to the other side of the lake. The Dementors swirl angrily above his head, still trying to reach the figures on the opposite shore, but Harry concentrates even harder, and they retreat. He sees himself staring from the other side of the lake, then falling unconscious beside Sirius, as the light from Harry's wand fades. Buckbeak flies Harry and Hermione back to the school, swooping over Hogwarts Castle, and the hippogriff glides down towards the dark tower where Sirius is imprisoned. Hermione opens the barred door of his cell, and Buckbeak carries Hermione, Sirius, and Harry away from the dark tower. Beating its huge wings, the hippogriff swoops down towards the ground, and Sirius lays his hand on Harry's heart before climbing onto Buckbeak's back and smiling at Hermione.",
    "771": "While Kate tends to Tenzen, she turns and realizes Noah is nowhere to be seen and finds his jacket before submerging herself under the water. Meanwhile, Noah swims away, and underwater, Jackson swims using a torch for illumination, spotting something. Jackson surfaces, then dives back underwater as the ark floats towards Everest. Adriane turns on the monitor, showing Jackson in the chamber struggling to free Tenzen's power drill. Jackson looks up and sees a light and Noah, and Noah joins his father underwater, where his torch beam shows the drill wrapped around the gears. Father and son surface while Kate gapes and stares into the blackness as Tenzen addresses his family and shakes his head. The water level rises, and Nina glances up, seeing a giraffe beyond the grill in the ceiling. Jackson is underwater as the ark thumps into a glacier, attempting to pry the power drill free while the ark scrapes against the mountain. Laura and Lily are buffeted by the shake, and as the ark approaches Everest, the fume from the hydraulic chamber is cut. Jackson wrenches the cable free, the gears start to turn, and the gate starts to close. He releases the drill, and part of the mountain breaks in pieces as the ark moves ever closer to a collision. It strikes Everest, and those on the bridge see an avalanche of snow descend, but the ark continues on its voyage away from Everest. Noah surfaces on the hydraulics chamber in front of Kate, and mother and son duck under the water, then resurface. Those on the bridge and in the zoological bay listen, hanging on the pipes, and look into the darkness. A torchlight beam shines underwater, and Jackson surfaces. Kate and Noah hug, and Anheuser looks around at the people on the bridge cheering and hugging one another. Scotty embraces Professor West, and with Kate and Noah still hugging, Jackson glances across to Nina and Tenzen and gets a thumbs up, to which Jackson nods. The group is still treading water as the ark continues on its voyage away from the world's highest mountain. Adriane works on a laptop in his quarters with Laura sitting behind him reading a book. Adriane takes off his glasses and smiles, Laura closes the book and smiles, and they are both on their feet. He walks over to her, and they get so close to kiss before he makes to move away. She puts her arms around his neck and kisses him more intensely. Meanwhile, Lily spots little Caesar, and Alec Karpov hands Lily the dog. Jackson approaches Kate as the massive door opens, and hundreds of people stand staring out as daylight starts to flood the interior. Lily, holding Caesar, and Noah, clutching his mom's hand, stand beside Kate with Jackson directly behind her.",
    "1331": "In response to that, Charlie does the only thing someone can do when told such a thing: she laughs. At this, Charlie goes white, the realization hitting her, and Michael nods. Charlie sways on her feet, and Jeep rests a hand on her shoulder, steadying her. With a clank, Michael re-arms his weapon and turns to the group with finality, while Percy looks at him skeptically. Kyle looks at Percy with fear in his eyes, then turns back to the darkness and the evil that surrounds them. Bob plays with his trusty zippo with one hand and grills up some steaks with the other, pausing to take a slug from a can of beer. Sandra sits at the counter across from him, staring at a prescription bottle tipped in front of her, pills spread around. Bob glances over, sees the devastation in her eyes, pulls another can of beer from underneath the counter, pops it, and places it in front of her. She looks up at him, smiles weakly, and takes a sip. The moment the words leave her mouth, the grief hits her again. Meanwhile, in a booth across the diner, Audrey is fiddling with Percy's old radio. At the front of the diner, Jeep silently helps Michael nail broken table planks across the shattered window, eyeing the strange tattoos running down Michael's arms and the two jagged wounds visible above his shirt line. Michael considers the question a beat, then drives the last nail into place, securing the window. He pauses a beat as if unsure how much to say, then heads for the roof, leaving Jeep to stare after him, deep in thought. The faintest glint of sunlight shines through the dark red dusty haze as Michael searches the horizon in front of the diner for movement. On the other side of the roof, Bob keeps watch, struggling to stay awake as his eyes droop closed. Sandra awakens with a start, spins around, and searches for who is calling her name. She turns to face the back door, which is blocked by a desk, and slowly approaches it. Sandra is stricken and notices the transom window above the door. She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out, finding Howard, her husband, there. His skin is covered with horrible black boils that are breathing, and Sandra goes slack with horror. She struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags Kyle in the face, causing Kyle to go down just as Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her. Percy springs up as Howard is nailed to the upside-down cross below, and Audrey rushes into the room to stop her mother, Sandra, who then slaps Audrey hard, causing Audrey to stumble over Kyle and hit the floor.",
    "1212": "He sees the cloth with the twine wrapped around it. He picks up the cloth, revealing the triggered bomb mechanism beneath. The claymore ignites the Tall Boy Missile, which erupts into a mushroom cloud of smoke and flame. The blast tears through trees and shrubs and spreads out like a concentric wave of destruction from its epicenter, throwing up dirt and leaves and knocking over soldiers. Sarah and School Boy watch. From the river, the tall boat captain notes the grey smoke from the explosion on land and signals with his hand. The boat moves off. Sarah and School Boy keep running. The patrol boat zips along the river. Sarah and School Boy run down a leafy path. He motions her to stop. They crouch. He rests his rifle on a tree and uses the site as a telescope. She looks. The escapees are being kicked and beaten by soldiers. School Boy lifts his rifle off the tree and searches the area using the sight. In his cross-hairs is the commander's truck with its machine gun operator. Sarah and School Boy are on a hill overlooking the harbor. Soldiers kick and stomp on the mercenaries and missionaries, who cover their heads with their hands. Some of the troops use the butts of their rifles to inflict blows. The commander supervises. The commander beats them with a stick. The commander whips them with his stick. Reese's lips move, as if in silent prayer. The commander jabs his stick into Lewis' shredded leg. The group are dragged to their knees and lined up in front of the troops, who raise their rifles execution-style. Michael stares hopelessly ahead. From above, Sarah and School Boy look distraught. The troops take aim. The group have their hands on their heads. En-Joo spits on the ground. The gunner on the Jeep watches intently, not seeing Rambo rise behind him. Rambo cuts off his head with a machete. He shoots the Jeep driver with the machine gun. He turns the gun around on its turntable and begins picking off the Burmese troops. From his vantage point, School Boy lines off troops in his sights. A single shot from School Boy rips through two soldiers in tandem. Sarah covers her ears and shots arise. The remains of the Jeep driver tumble off the vehicle. A group of soldiers are cut in two. A soldier's leg is severed at the knee, and he falls over. En-Joo finds a weapon and starts shooting. Lewis grabs a soldier by the leg and pulls him over, head-butts him unconscious, and spits on him contemptuously. Reese pulls a knife from his boot and stabs a trooper. Lewis finds a weapon and dishes out mayhem of his own.",
    "648": "He moves carefully with the spoon over to the table and opens Arvind's eyelids to pour in the liquid as Salim can watch no more and kneels to vomit. Maman watches impassively as the bearded man binds Arvind's eyes with the bandage and pats his head, then Maman looks at Salim and nods. The bearded man prepares another spoon of liquid, and shock registers on Salim's face as he is rooted to the spot with Maman drawing closer to him. Maman crouches in front of Salim and gestures for Punnoose to follow him, while Jamal starts to dance. Salim appears, and they shake hands as Jamal follows Salim back to Maman with Punnoose following behind. Salim leads Jamal towards Maman and his bearded henchman followed closely by Punnoose, as Latika spies on the scene. Maman and his henchmen look at Jamal astounded while Latika snickers as she watches Jamal pocket the 50 rupee note. Punnoose gestures to Salim to pick up the cloth and the chloroform bottle, then Salim takes the bottle and suddenly throws the contents at Punnoose's face. Salim, Jamal, and Latika run through a forest chased by Maman, Punnoose, and the bearded henchmen until they come to a railway siding where they chase a departing train. Salim is in front and manages to grab hold of the last carriage of the train, and Jamal then reaches out and grabs a hand hold on the train. The men close in on Latika who is still chasing the back of the train while Salim stretches out his hand and Latika touches his fingers when Salim suddenly pulls back. Latika is left standing on the tracks as Maman reaches her and scoops her up while Jamal looks stunned. Jamal looks around the dark railway carriage where men are lying down watching them while Punnoose holds Latika as Maman watches the train. On the game show, the host stares at Jamal, and then Jamal is seen in the police station. Young Salim and Jamal sit on the roof of the moving train, with Salim staring at a pensive Jamal, then wrapping an arm around him as the boys start selling fruit, nuts, even balloons to passengers on the train. Salim counts their earnings while Jamal daydreams and remembers a young Latika standing on the tracks as the train pulls away, sitting on the buffers between two carriages chatting with Salim as the train winds its way through lush forests and across wide expanses of Indian countryside. Salim and Jamal sell trinkets to passengers as the two brothers sleep in sacks of vegetables, but the guard rouses them and throws them off the train, with Salim later sounding on the roof of a train, hauling Jamal up on a rope. As the train speeds through the countryside, the two brothers doze on the roof, gripping each other's hands.",
    "1044": "Enrique takes the gun from his holster and checks the magazine, then he cocks the gun. His arms, face, and hair are wet with sweat as he steps out from behind a pillar and looks along the road, glaring. Suddenly, the story rewinds to Enrique cocking the gun, being hit by the first car, seeing Veronica in the ambulance, Holden aiming his gun at him, the explosion, being tackled by Barnes and the man Veronica was with, and the clock reaches twelve noon. In the enclosed Plaza Mayor, a seething crowd watches a helicopter overhead. The man in the checked shirt, Howard Lewis, is videoing. He records the upper windows and one of the many arches in the plaza while kids shout hello from some of the balconies. Howard walks away from the kids and resumes videoing. The timer on his LCD screen reads nearly two hours and two minutes as he strolls deeper into the crowd, his camera focused above their heads. He pans his camera around, and on the LCD screen he sees Veronica by the pillar with the young man Enrique saw her with. He zooms in as she places something in his hand and clutches his palm, then lowers his gaze and stops filming as their heads move closer. Howard films some more until a short man approaches him, and a little girl bumps him with her ice cream. Sam leaves, and the little girl sobs. Howard bends down and asks her name, but Anna is dragged off by her mother, glancing back. Alerted by applause, Howard goes into record mode as President Ashton steps up onto the podium and shakes the Mayor's hand. Howard moves forward as the Mayor walks to the lectern, his eyes fixed on the LCD screen, grinning. Howard's camera pans to take in Barnes looking upward and speaking into his cuff mic. Howard wheels around and focuses on the moving curtain, looks up from the screen, and sees a shadow behind the curtain, keeping his camera focused on the shadowy figure. He then turns as the President is shot. Howard keeps the tape running as Holden and Matthews race to the President, and the crowds peel back from the podium. Howard spins back to the now open window, then to the podium as Enrique leaps onto it. The video captures Barnes tackling Enrique, and despite the chaos around them, Howard continues to videotape the events in front of him. Howard tapes Veronica tossing her bag under the podium and fleeing, while the crowds grow more restless upon hearing the distant explosion. Anna has lost hold of her mother's hand, and panicking people flee and stand on those who have stumbled. Howard uses his cell phone.",
    "1175": "They rush up to her desk and slowly turn and leave. Outside in the corridor, he stares hard at Harry as Snape stalks away along the corridor, his black cloak billowing behind him. The school is silhouetted against moonlit clouds. Harry, Ron, and Hermione creep downstairs into the common room, where they spot Neville's toad. Neville gets up from a chair, freezes, and falls over backwards. Leaving Neville, they all huddle under the invisibility cloak as Hermione unlocks the door on the third floor. A harp is playing by itself, and they take off the cloak to see the three-headed dog is asleep. They take hold of it and between them, they push the dog's huge paw off the trapdoor. The dog breathes out, and they stagger back, lifting the wooden cover to stare down into the black hole beneath. Dog dribble hits Ron as the dog opens its three mouths. They throw themselves into the hole as the dog destroys the trapdoor. They have landed on something soft, but the plant begins to move, slithering tentacles snake over them, twisting around their arms and legs, and twining around their necks. The boys struggle to free themselves as Hermione suddenly slithers out of sight, and Harry slithers after her. She points her wand and a flash of light dissolves the plant, allowing Ron to fall through to join them. Harry frowns at him, and they go through a door into a room with solid stone pillars. Small winged objects flit above their heads, and a shabby broomstick is hanging in the air. Ron tries the locked door as Harry looks at the broomstick, nods, puts out his hand, and takes hold of it. At once, the hundreds of metal keys swarm dangerously around his head. Harry climbs onto the broomstick and steers it upwards, suddenly spotting the key with a broken wing as it zooms upwards out of his reach. He points the broom after the key as it flies towards a high window. It turns back and Harry grabs it, throwing it to Hermione who quickly puts it into the lock. The flying keys go mad and chase after Harry like a swarm of bees as Hermione and Ron push open the door and Harry zooms inside. The door closes after him, and unable to stop, the keys herd into it. A room full of strange shadows, with huge broken stone statues lying about the floor. Ron, Harry, and Hermione come into the gloomy room and walk slowly between the piles of shattered figures as Ron looks around the room. Torches flare up showing a floor of huge black and white squares, and great stone chess pieces face each other across the enormous marble chessboard with fierce warriors barring their way with drawn swords. The white pawns.",
    "899": "As the blonde man draws closer, Dillinger grabs him in a chokehold and aims a gun at Gilbert. He cocks his head. D'Andrea looks at Gilbert whose hand rests on his gun. He turns to Dillinger and Red. Dillinger tosses the blonde man away. D'Andrea sits calmly on the edge of a desk. Dillinger holsters his gun. Dillinger knits his brow thoughtfully then meets D'Andrea's gaze. D'Andrea shrugs. Dillinger glares at D'Andrea, his lips curved into a frown. The mustached gangster leans in closer. Dillinger tilts his head, his eyes narrowing as he meets D'Andrea's gaze. He turns away. Dillinger and Red exit. Now, Hoover and Purvis walk down a hall. Outside, Hoover turns from Purvis and heads over to a group of well-dressed boys standing in two lines. They shake hands. Hoover faces the press. In a movie theatre, the event plays on a newsreel. Dillinger talks to the rugged gangster. Dillinger nods his head at Shouse. A photo of Dillinger appears onscreen. Dillinger subtly covers his face. Shouse stands and Red yanks him back into his seat. Homer looks away nervously. As Dillinger sits with a worried look, his face tilted down, the overhead light turns on, bathing the audience member's faces. The audience turns, peering at the people to the right. The audience turns again. As the audience members settle their eyes back toward the front, the lights fade down and a new story begins. Tommy turns to Dillinger. Dillinger rubs his lips thoughtfully as he looks at Tommy and nods. He exchanges a glance with Red and they rise, grabbing their coats. A few rows ahead, Homer puts on his hat and steps into the aisle behind them. As they exit the theater, Red moves closer to Dillinger. People mill around a town square. A stiff wind flutters the awnings of a storefront. On the far side of the square, a policeman pulls up on a motorcycle. Inside a bank, Baby Face stands on a table and fires his gun through a window at the policeman. He fires at the ceiling. Outside, Homer grabs a man and holds him hostage. Inside, Dillinger and Tommy exchange an exasperated look. From inside a vault, Dillinger tosses a bag to Tommy. He guides the bank president by the shoulder. A woman joins the bank president. The gangsters shield themselves with the hostages as they exit the bank. They pass Homer, who waits outside by their car with his own hostage. Baby Face fires wildly into the town square. Two men dive to the ground. From a window across the street, a man aims a gun. Dillinger lurches forward, his eyes wide. He drops to a seated position, his gun still raised, then notices Tommy who lies on his stomach in a pool of blood.",
    "536": "Holly, excited, runs over to April, who is busy taking the Stroganoff out of the oven, and April, wearing the same uniform as Holly—a black skirt, white shirt, and black bowtie—holding the Stroganoff, dashes out of the kitchen to serve the party guests. Holly calls after her, offscreen, as David walks past the hurrying April into the kitchen and walks over to Holly, who is busy at the pot-and-pan-covered stove. As Holly carries the quiche outside to the party, April comes back into the kitchen from another doorway, walks past David to a counter where she begins to fold napkins, and David leans back against the sink. They shake hands, and April walks offscreen to another area of the kitchen. Holly picks up a napkin from the crowded table, and David walks around the table, putting the plate of clams down on the already crowded surface. Holly follows him, chuckling, throwing her napkin into an offscreen garbage can as David stops at a small television set near the doorway. Guests in the other room can be seen chatting together in clusters, while canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter are heard from the television set. David watches the set, still munching on a clam, while Holly and April reassure him offscreen. David checks his wristwatch as Holly walks over to him, chuckles as David, listening to April, impressed, walks over to her, as she is standing by the table. April chuckles as Holly walks back onscreen, busy preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres, and the three exchange glances. Holly shrugs, and a contemporary red building, designed by David, is seen, squeezed in between two older buildings. Holly, April, and David talk offscreen, and the film moves down from the buildings to reveal the trio sitting in David's Jaguar across the street, with David and April in the front seat and Holly scrunched up in back, her head slightly forward. David turns and briefly glances at Holly, then turns back to April. The screen, which has been exploring the rococo building's facade, now shows the equally elegant building alongside it. The film moves from the two elegant facades to show an ugly, ultra-modern structure covered with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs, then moves from the ugly facade to the building's equally ugly entrance, where a large car is parked right in front of the building. The group is now seen walking down the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the other side of the street, where they'd been gazing at both the lovely and ugly facades across the way, with David in the lead, and the women follow, Holly slightly behind April. David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women, waiting for their decision.",
    "1133": "A bus and a lorry approach as Hagrid rides upside down on the tunnel roof, with Harry hanging out of the sidecar, running over the bus, and dropping back in when the bike returns to the road. Hagrid slumps forward, hit by a bolt from a death eater, and Harry grabs the handlebars, forcing the motorbike up into the air. Hedwig flies towards them and attacks the chasing death eater, but as the owl swoops to attack again, she is hit by a bolt of green light and tumbles earthwards. The death eater pulls back, and Harry suddenly cries out in pain, his face contorting as another ominous, dark figure closes in. Harry slumps forward, his jagged scar illuminated by the bike's headlight. As they speed between two lines of electric pylons, Harry's wand lights of its own accord. The dark figure draws level, and the power flowing from Harry's wand connects with an equal force of pulsating energy. The swirling vortex of light travels up Voldemort's wand, illuminating his face, and an explosion rocks the bike. Harry presses the control button, and the bike zooms away, spewing out flames that propel Voldemort backwards as the electric pylons collapse. Harry, Hagrid, and the bike soar upwards beyond the clouds, and Hagrid comes to and takes control of the bike. As Harry settles back into the sidecar, the engine fails, and they hurdle downwards. Molly Weasley hears them break through the protective shield around their house as they plummet towards the ground, making a bumpy landing in a reed bed. They slow to a halt near the Weasley's home, and the bike throws up a spume of water, soaking both rider and passenger. Harry and Hagrid exchange a look and trudge towards the house, where Ginny follows her mother out, with Lupin supporting George, whose left ear is covered in blood. George is carried inside and laid on a sofa as Lupin grabs Harry by the collar, pinning him against the fireplace before lowering his wand and letting Harry go. Lupin steps back, and Harry nods. Lupin races out as Kingsley and Hermione return, and the two men point their wands at each other before Kingsley lowers his wand and turns to Harry. A thestral lands, carrying Bill and Fleur, while Nymphadora Tonks approaches with another Harry lookalike, who changes back into Ron as Hermione rushes to hug him. Lupin embraces Nymphadora, and Harry runs to embrace Hermione and Ron. Mr. Weasley returns with Fred, who runs indoors as Mr. Weasley follows anxiously. Mrs. Weasley strokes George's brow as Fred kneels down beside his twin. The others gather around, with Ron looking anxious. Fred leans towards George, who has a large wound in his ear and points to it. Bill steps forward, his face grim, and stunned, everyone looks at each other in shock.",
    "1078": "They stand next to each other guiltily, as Nullah climbs down from the tree. Sarah stares at him curiously, as he moves pensively away from her. She looks shocked. He eyes her steadily. He draws near her, and she looks up at him. She smiles and looks down at the ground. He gives a tight smile and walks off. She hesitates, then wanders through the long grass. In daylight, a steer lies dead next to a watering hole. Magarri checks the water. Drover, Sarah, and Nullah ride up. Magarri looks thoughtful. It's a great sandy desert. Nullah rides up as they stand glumly at the watering hole. Sarah stares at a solitary figure approaching across the dusty plain. King George is standing on one leg, propped against his spear, staring at them through the swirling dust. They approach him. King George sings, jumps and dances with his spears against the flaming sky of sunset. The cattle move agitatedly through the dust storm which engulfs the drove. King George continues his singing. Nullah dreams his grandfather finds water and catches a fish. In the middle of the twilight desert, King George holds up a fish on a pole. He stands chanting, his long hair, beard, and body caked in dust. Carney offers a pen to the captain. Fletcher hangs up the phone in the cattle pen as the captain pauses over a purchase agreement. The women in the salon watch in wonder as a calf wanders past the window. The building starts to shake as the captain signs the agreement. Sweating in the oppressive Darwin heat, he looks up as the drove thunders into town. Carney frowns and the salon women stare in awe as the street fills with cattle. Carney peers through the slats of his sun-blinds as Sarah rides up. Carney glares at him. They turn their horses and gallop off. Carney dives for the phone. Fletcher stares in angry disbelief as the Drover jumps his horse into the holding yard. Drover rides through the yard, cracking his whip as Fletcher frantically tries to organize his team. The gates out of the pen are closed in front of Drover, and the gate to the wooden loading tunnel raised. Cattle stream into it as Sarah rides toward the docks at the head of her herd. Sarah's herd rumbles on as the laughing Carney men urge their charges into the loading tunnel which runs down the wharf. Drover thinks for a moment, then rides off. He jumps the fence around the yard, knocking out the top slat, and rides into the street outside the Territory Hotel. Fletcher glares at him. Drover looks across at the Carney herd being loaded. He rides towards the large cargo vessel at the end of the wharf.",
    "1109": "Ron's hair is turning red, and they turn and run out of the common room. Back in the girls' lavatory, Myrtle floats past. Still in uniform, Hermione has become a cat. Outside, the lightning flashes, and inside, Ron and Harry walk upstairs where they stop as they find a pool of water on the landing. They run through it, and in the girls' lavatory, all the taps are running. Harry and Ron look around at the overflowing sinks and spot Myrtle sitting high up on a curved stone windowsill. Ron flinches as she floats past, and Harry notices a book with a limp, black leather cover lying on the stone floor. He picks it up and shakes off the water, but the book is soaking wet. Later, he sits at his desk and flicks through the dried-out pages, which are all blank. He flicks through the book again and sees a name stamped in gold letters on the back. He puts the book down, picks up a quill, and dips it into the inkwell. As he goes to write on the first empty page, a drop of ink falls from the quill, hits the paper, and slowly disappears. Harry turns over the page, but the ink blot has vanished. He dips his quill again and starts to write. His words fade into the paper, but other words appear. Harry writes again, and the answer appears on the page. Harry leans back, disappointed, but more words appear. The blank pages turn themselves over quickly, and he picks up the book with both hands and stares at it. A bright light shines out of the pages, dazzling Harry. As he disappears, the book on his desk closes. Stepping back into the past, Harry reappears in a school corridor and warily approaches the foot of a wide staircase. A teenage boy in Hogwarts uniform is standing at the bend of the stairs, staring at the landing above. Harry slowly goes up the stairs towards him, follows his gaze, and sees four people carrying down a stretcher covered with a sheet. As they pass Harry, he sees a limp arm sticking out from under the sheet. A man with a long, brown beard appears at the top of the stairs, and Harry looks up in surprise as Dumbledore gives him a searching look. Riddle leaves, turns into a wide corridor licked by flaming torches, and hurries along until he reaches the top of a narrow flight of stone steps. Harry follows him down the steps into a gloomy corridor with rough stone walls. Riddle approaches a heavy wooden door, takes out his wand, and looks around warily before throwing open the door to reveal a shadowy figure bending over a large wooden box.",
    "1332": "Percy appears in the doorway as Sandra whips open the back door, and that's when the world hits slow motion; Howard is a few feet away and is alive as Sandra races toward him, with Percy just behind her. Then the speed accelerates to normal as Howard's body explodes, spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra. At that moment, Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, and the door slams closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room, where Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. Charlie turns to look at Percy, still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily. He takes a step forward, then falls to the ground, with the entire back side of his body burned away, and his body lies covered on the table. Bob stares ruefully at his dead friend, tears streaming down his face, as Jeep watches his father from the doorway. Kyle looks over at Charlie, feeling defeated, while she shakes her head, anger building. Charlie stands at the sink with a cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment, taking a deep drag, feeling the smoke filling her lungs, defiant. She catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly, and tears well up in her eyes as fear and anger overtake her. She stamps out the cigarette in frustration as Jeep sees the strain on her face. After a long beat, as Jeep considers her, she turns to him, bitterness overtaking her, and Jeep's face hardens. He gets up, looking hurt and frustrated from Charlie, and then walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response. Outside, the invisible sun is sinking as Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch, with Kyle showing her how to hold the MP5. Audrey points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life, prompting Kyle's surprised look. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on, hands the gun over to Kyle, and stares into the surrounding red nothingness, her expression growing distant, seeming to have aged years overnight. She smiles at this confession and leans in, as if something beyond sensual need has taken over. Just then, the spotlights illuminating the roof sign come to life, the gas pumps light up down below, the station's fluorescents flicker on, and Bob’s TV glows with bright rolling static. Meanwhile, Jeep and Michael move to look through the slats at the window, while Charlie gives Sandra some water through a straw.",
    "1356": "As Alice nervously drives, she shakes her head: no. Alice nods; if not quite relieved, at least grateful for Joe. But they all stare off for a long beat. CRANE DOWN as the Buick pulls up. The dusty boys pile out. They all kind of look at each other. Charles, who looks at Joe for a beat, holds up his defunct camera on the tripod. Joe nods. Alice finds something on the passenger seat and holds it out. Joe goes to the window. Alice holds it out: THE CUBE. He takes it with. It all continues as Joe has entered from the front door. Joe is moving toward the living room, where Charles sits on the sofa, eyes glued to the TV, a train crash being reported on the local news; helicopter shot of the wreck. Both stare at the train crash, stunned. And we push in on Charles, going from depressed and lost to. Joe and Charles ride their bikes into town, across a bridge, the massive steel mill in the background. Tilt down from the town's water tower -- Joe and Charles ride their bikes underneath it, crossing Main Street -- two large military trucks drive past, we may note the airman in the passenger seat scans the area with a handheld device. As Charles opens the camera, pulls out the film. Charles reacts; he's never smoked anything. Lower-lower-middle class house, set against woods. Joe with Alice at her front door. She seems unnerved. Joe watches Louis get out of the car -- the man who got arrested at his mother's wake -- carrying a small grocery bag. He sees Joe and darkens as he approaches. Joe steps back as Louis arrives; Louis seems to hate Joe, but at the same time, can barely look at him. Louis goes back inside. Alice follows, turns to Joe. Then, quietly, conflicted. She closes the door. Alone, despite it all, Joe is happy. Off his smile, we hear loud pops: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM. Martin -- as Detective Hathaway -- fires a gun -- shooting Cary, dressed in a dirty suit, as a man turning into a zombie -- his eyes wide and glossy white -- and as he is hit by the bullets, he slams his hand onto his chest -- blood bursts all over him, and he falls painfully to the ground. We then find Charles, behind his camera, yelling out. Wide shot, rising past six bicycles, thrown to the ground in a typical kid jumble. Charles, Joe, and Preston, with Joe's dad's Kodak camera on a tripod, have been filming, their gear scattered. Keep moving over them, to Martin and Alice, who were on camera. Beyond them, in the valley, the train crash seems to go forever.",
    "1173": "In the classroom next door, Harry reappears as he takes off the invisibility cloak. The moonlight, filtering through the snow on the window panes, gives the empty classroom a mysterious air. Harry looks around curiously. Through a stone arch, he glimpses a large mirror and a carved frame that goes down a few steps into the room beyond. As he walks slowly towards the mirror, he sees his own reflection getting closer. He stops in front of it and tries to read the writing carved around the wooden frame, but the words are strange and unfamiliar. Harry stands still for a moment, gazing at himself, then takes a step forward towards his reflection. To his surprise, two shadowy figures gradually appear in the mirror, standing one on each side of him: a young man and young woman. Harry turns, but the room behind him is completely empty. He looks back at the pretty young woman and swallows nervously. She nods and smiles. Harry's kind-looking father beams at him. Harry stretches out a hand towards them, but his fingers only touch his reflection in the glass. As his mother puts her hand on the shoulder of his reflection in the mirror, Harry puts a hand on his own shoulder. His mother fondly smiles at him again. Harry looks at her sadly. Harry pulls the cover off Ron's bed. In the empty classroom, they take off the invisibility cloak. They run to the mirror. With his knees tucked under his chin, Harry sits alone on the stone floor of the empty classroom, gazing into the mirror. Professor Dumbledore appears by the window. Harry gets to his feet. Dressed in a warm black cloak and wearing his red and gold Gryffindor scarf, Harry crosses the snow-covered courtyard with his pet white owl perched on his arm. The beautiful bird stretches its wings. Harry lifts his arm, and the snowy owl balances for a moment, then launches itself into the air. Harry watches as it soars above his head, swooping around the courtyard, then up and over the grey stone towers of the school, flying higher and higher until it disappears into the snow-laden sky. Now, the white owl flies back towards Hogwarts. It passes the hoops of the Quidditch goal posts. The snow has melted, and green grass has reappeared. Fluffy white clouds float in the blue sky. In the library, Hermione gives Ron a withering look. She finds the right page. Hermione, Harry, and Ron hurry across the wet grass towards a stone cottage on the edge of the forest. He lets them in. Wearing oven gloves, Hagrid takes something out of a pot hanging there at the fire.",
    "521": "A jogger crosses in front of him. The film cuts abruptly to Mickey's flashback of his date with Holly, beginning with a rock club performance. Three punkers--a girl with pink hair, a girl with a spiked mohawk, and a guy with Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses--watch and bop their heads to the sounds of the offscreen rock band, The 39 Steps. The camera moves to the stage, revealing a sleazy-looking rock band in the midst of their number. As the band loudly plays on, the camera moves across the spellbound audience, sitting at crowded, smoky, small tables, to reveal a stricken Mickey and a mesmerized Holly squeezed together at one of them. A nearby member of the audience swills beer from a bottle. Holly, beating time to the music and enjoying herself, takes a puff of her cigarette. She glances at Mickey impatiently. Holly turns back to the band, who are still in full swing. The camera moves down the body of the lead singer, singing into a microphone, from his longish, curly red hair, through his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar. The camera moves back to Holly and the even more stricken-looking Mickey. They are crowded in with people. In the background, a waitress holds up a tray. A man drinks from a glass mug; people chatter indistinctly over the loud band. Holly glances at Mickey once again, this time unable to contain her annoyance. She opens a vial of cocaine. Holly holds a short metal straw of cocaine to her nose and sniffs it. While Mickey pleads with her, Holly puts her cocaine vial into her purse. She holds a finger against one nostril and sniffs. She then picks up her lit cigarette and continues to smoke. Mickey and Holly, almost in dark silhouette, are walking at a fast clip along the sidewalk, arguing. They pass some lighted clothing store windows; a few cars go by in the dark street. The audience at their tables watch him, some with smiles of pleasure. A man has his arm around a woman. Mickey and Holly sit at one of the tables; a candle burns in its holder on the tabletop. Holly takes a cigarette from her purse as she holds her hand to her nose, sniffing. Mickey keeps shooting glances at Holly; she can't sit still. Holly lights her cigarette, dropping her matchbook on the floor. She bends down to pick it up, then starts to fidget in her chair. She gulps her wine; she sniffs. Mickey tries to watch the offscreen Bobby Short; he crosses his arms across his chest. The film cuts back briefly to Bobby Short playing the piano. A taxi pulls away from the curb as Mickey and Holly walk out of the hotel through its revolving doors.",
    "1077": "In the movie, Nullah runs towards him, and Flynn is trampled by the panicked animals. Nullah winces at the sight and stands alone, facing the stampede on the cliff edge, as the stampede gets closer in slow motion. Drover and Sarah urge their horses on, while Fletcher grins cruelly. Nullah concentrates and stretches out his arms, and his grandfather chants with him. He stands right on the cliff edge as the herd slows and, just yards from him, comes to a stop. King George looks down on the scene, and as Sarah and Drover arrive, Nullah starts to cry. Sarah dismounts and grabs him just before he falls into the abyss, and Drover grabs them both, pulling them backward to safety. Nullah stares up at Sarah, then turns and nuzzles into her shoulder, while Drover stands awkwardly and backs away from the pair. King George smiles proudly. Drover gallops to Flynn, who lies twisted and bloody in the dust, placing his ear close to Flynn's mouth to hear him as his eyes flutter and close. Drover frowns, looks down at Flynn, picks up his hat from next to the dead man, and puts it on while holding Flynn's harmonica. Later, Nullah holds the harmonica as Sarah sits in the smoking remnants of their camp, holding out one of her hats, which she drops on the ground as her face creases with grief. She watches him as Drover walks up beside her, and they look with determination into each other's eyes. Under a blazing sun, with a blue sky flecked with high white clouds, the drove continues as Sarah rides confidently and brandishes the whip like an old-hand. Nullah rounds up a lone steer that strays off, and they head towards the golden glow of the sunset. Back at the cliff, Fletcher places a crocodile-skinned boot on the pile of rocks that is Flynn's grave, grabs a stone off the pile, and toys with it, looking thoughtfully into the abyss as his men ride up. A breeze blows Flynn's hat off the grave's wooden cross as Fletcher stares towards the herd, visible as a cloud of dust in the distance. Drover's team sets up camp by a river, and they all swig Poor Fella Rum from tin cups, except Drover, who swigs from the bottle. It's strong stuff, but Sing Song and Sarah hold out their cups for more, and the empty bottle drops to the ground at the feet of a startled wallaby, who sniffs at it. Sarah gets up and goes over to Drover, who's leaning against a tree. They stop laughing and look deeply into each other's eyes, and very slowly, their faces draw closer. Sarah closes her bright blue eyes, and very tenderly, they kiss.",
    "660": "He attaches a network of webs to the bridge, inside the dangling cable car. The web is struggling to hold MJ, Spider-Man, and the car. The Goblin sees a tugboat draw near, and hearing the sound of the glider, Spider-Man and MJ look up to see the Goblin on his way towards them. Part of the web gives way, and everything drops 20 feet. MJ clambers over Spider-Man and starts to climb down the cable. The Goblin flashes past Spider-Man, punching him. Like a gymnast on rings, Spider-Man's arms are stretched wide, one attached to the web supporting them all, the hand of the other still grasping the cable tightly. Another punch sends Spider-Man reeling and knocks the cable from his grasp, but he grabs the cable. MJ slips off it but clasps hold of the rail running around the cable car roof. The Green Goblin glides in for the kill as Spider-Man is lowering the cable car towards the barge. A blade shoots out, but the Goblin is hit by debris. Knocked off balance, the Goblin is kicked away by Spider-Man. The crowd on the bridge continues to throw debris. The cable car lands safely on the barge, MJ still clinging to it. MJ looks up at her hero and sees the Goblin closing in again. The Goblin throws a line around Spider-Man's waist and pulls him away behind the glider. Spider-Man crashes through the wall of an old ruin. He shoots out a web to steady himself and smashes through a pane of glass. Then a pumpkin bomb bounces towards him, and the fireball throws Spider-Man backwards. He's thrust through a brick wall and lands on the ground, half of his mask is burnt off. The Goblin reappears and punches Spider-Man in the chest and face, then kicks him and punches him again. A punch sends Spider-Man high into the air, and he lands heavily. The Goblin flips up and punches him again. Spider-Man shoots out a web and tries to pull himself clear, but the Goblin thwarts that. Spider-Man shoots more threads and builds a large web, which slows down the Green Goblin, but can't hold him. Spider-Man goes on the attack, but is beaten back. A kick to the head and a drop kick to the chest send Spider-Man reeling. He crashes into a brick wall and collapses on the ground. He raises his wrist, but the Goblin's boot comes down on it. Spider-Man's eyes flare and he grits his teeth. The Goblin lunges at Spider-Man with a multi-bladed spear, but Spider-Man stops it in front of his face. He pushes it back, then hurls the Goblin across the ruin. The Goblin scrabbles around, but webs wrap around the Goblin's ankles and Spider-Man yanks him down.",
    "223": "Everett, Pete, and Delmar take cover from the rain under the dripping eave of a barn, holding their coats pinched shut at the neck as they look forlornly at the weather. They walk along a red dirt road elevated through a bayou and later sit around a campfire where Everett, sitting on a stump, expressively tells a ghost story while Pete and Delmar gaze at him, wide-eyed and rapt. The three men continue their journey past a cotton field dotted with burst pods. Meanwhile, a sad-faced woman in a calico dress addresses the clerk and appears crestfallen. As a car approaches, Pete's door flies open before it stops, and he stumbles down the bank to the river, followed more casually by Everett and Delmar, with Everett chuckling. The unearthly singing they hear is from three beautiful women who sing while dunking clothes in the stream. Pete is all awkward smiles with deep, burning eyes, trying to speak to the laundresses. The women do not answer him but smile as they continue to sing. Pete tries again as she reaches into their laundry basket, and his eyes remain glued on the women as he hisses out of the corner of his mouth. Everett laughs lightly. None of the women respond, but as they continue to sing, one brings a jug marked with three Xs to Everett. Delmar stares horrified at a pile of clothes as a spot in the middle rises and falls rhythmically. As Everett joins Delmar to look, the rhythmic movement travels up the shirt, and a large yellow toad emerges from under the collar. Delmar keens, while Everett is bewildered, and the toad hops down the river bank. Delmar has the toad on his lap, whimpering as he pets it, with the frog croaking and Delmar continuing to whimper. Everett squints and shakes his head. Nearby, tables are formally laid with linen as Delmar and Everett sit at a table with a shoebox between them, deep in conversation, with Everett pointing a knife at the shoebox. We then see over the shoulder of a broad-shouldered man in a cream-colored suit with a shirt that has a powder-blue collar. He digs into a huge plateful of steak and eggs, but sensing something, he looks up, cocks his head, and slowly turns to look back, revealing a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue trim. His good eye is looking intently off at Everett and Delmar, who continue arguing, out of earshot, just as the waitress arrives for their order.",
    "1046": "Holden and Parson open fire from across the highway, prompting Howard to flee and then zoom the camera back on Enrique. The officer stoops over Enrique's body and gently lifts his head, seeing Anna step out onto the highway as a white car swerves to avoid her. An ambulance motors over the crest of the hill bridge, and Howard runs along the highway towards Anna. He freezes in the middle of the road as the speeding ambulance hurdles towards her, then makes a mad dash for her. The picture freezes and the events run in reverse, showing Enrique bouncing from the windscreen of a red sedan. Howard scoops Anna in his arms as the fiery explosion shrinks into nothing, into blackness. Marksmen watch from the rooftops of tall buildings as the President's motorcade proceeds towards the plaza. President Ashton is on a car phone with Cavic and another agent sitting opposite him. The motorcade halts in the shadows beneath a bridge where another dark-suited man, Ted Heinkin, climbs into the President's car and lowers the phone. Heinkin hangs up the phone and narrows his eyes, removing two flags from the bonnet of the President's limousine and putting a document in a folder before slamming it shut. Ashton stares gravely out of the window as a seething crowd fills the Plaza Mayor. The double's motorcade passes beneath the watchful snipers while the crowd of protesters waves placards at the roadside. The President's limo drives into the hotel's underground car park where government agents stand watch outside the glass wall of the Hotel Vesta. The President gets out of his limo in a bright, empty parking lot dotted with armed agents, followed by Heinkin and silver-haired Phil McCullough into an elevator. A besuited agent runs a swipe card through a machine and talks into a radio. An inflatable skull and two skeleton hands are waved by protesters outside the Plaza Mayor as Matthews and Holden cross to the limousine, and Matthews opens the door for the Ashton double. In the elevator, Ashton reads through a folder of large photographs, while a guilty McCullough looks awkward and then looks away. Ashton stares at McCullough, then steps out of the elevator, and Heinkin raises an eyebrow as they follow Ashton down a corridor. At the plaza, the crowd waves Spanish flags as the Secret Service agents escort Ashton's double to the podium. In his hotel room, Ashton opens the curtains and gazes out of the window of the Plaza Mayor where the Secret Service agents take positions around the President on the red-carpeted podium. De Soto stands at the lectern. Ashton sees his double on TV and then his double is shot. McCullough grabs the phone as Barnes floors Enrique, and Ashton watches live footage of Barnes pinning Enrique down. Ashton is transfixed and then turns.",
    "134": "The camera races with the train along the river's edge, the reflected sun glimmering on the windows. The sun is high and the train is stopped by the river. We see an English clergyman from the Second Class coaches, dipping a toe cautiously into the water, children of some British enlisted soldiers wading, splashing, faces alight with fun. Across the river down from the Third Class coaches, a small group of Indian women is squatted by the river's edge, washing clothes. Some carry infants on their backs, and some small children stand near them. Their ritual of washing goes on, but they are all watching the passengers of the train. Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie among the Third Class passengers. Charlie, his trousers rolled up, plays a tentative splashing game with a skinny little Indian boy. Gandhi is holding a large white head cloth which he is soaking in the water, but his eyes have been arrested by the sight of the women across the river. Their bodies are skin and bone. The clothes they wear, which looked normal from the distance, are rags - literally, shredded rags, one hung on another. Gandhi stares for a moment, a long beat. Climbing green hills - a totally different terrain - and again we intercut, this time the train climbing: a boy and buffalo running a huge, crude grinding wheel, train climbing; farmers in terraced fields, train climbing faster and faster. Gandhi is leaning out of a window in a Third Class coach. Ahead of him, other passengers are looking too; some have jumped down. As they come clear, they can see that a military train of an engine and two cars has been derailed ahead of them. A small troop of cavalry is coming slowly along the line of Gandhi's train toward them. They are British, and their troop leader is viciously angry. Nehru takes an iced drink from a servant, and Nehru shakes his head wistfully. The train passes the camera to the Third Class section, which seems besieged by humanity. People cling to the outside of each door and many more are seated on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. Gandhi and Charlie are riding on the outside of the coach, hanging on through the door, and both enjoying it immensely. Ba, inside the jammed coach, finds it very unfunny. She has a grip on one of Gandhi's arms. The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience. And the audience cheers him. Newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him. Patel comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping.",
    "33": "Rick sits down at the table; as they talk, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle walk by toward the entrance of the cafe. It intermittently sheds its light on Rick's face. Casselle talks non-stop, and Tonelli tries. They both stop, salute Renault, and walk into the cafe. Rick laughs. Rick and Renault look up when they hear the BUZZ of a plane taking off from the adjacent airfield. The plane flies directly over their heads. Rick still looks in the direction of the airport; his look isn't a happy one. The three men enter the cafe and pass Sam at the piano. Rick pats Sam on the shoulder. Rick's eyes react, and involuntarily, they glance toward the gambling room. Renault catches the look. They start upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who is still haranguing Tonelli. They go inside the office, and Rick opens up the safe in a small, dark room just off the office. Only Rick's shadow can be seen getting the money out. Rick moves out of the shadows and into view, giving the money to Emil, who departs. Rick closes the door to the office, then goes over to close the safe. Renault watches Rick's reaction, and they sit down to discuss the matter in earnest. Rick makes a face. Renault stands up but stops short as his AIDE enters. Renault starts to leave and hurries away. Rick smiles cynically. Renault walks up to Carl, then over to one of his officers. The officer salutes and goes off to speak to the guards. Renault walks over to Strasser's table as Rick comes down the stairs. Renault sits down. Ugarte stands at the roulette table. Two gendarmes approach him from behind, and the officer nods. They follow Ugarte to the cashier's window, where Ugarte puts his chips through the window to the CASHIER and looks around. We move to Strasser's table, who has witnessed the event. Guards and gendarmes rush in and grab Ugarte. Rick stands impassively as they drag Ugarte off. Back to Rick, still standing where he was, as a CUSTOMER walks by. An air of tense expectancy pervades the room. Rick comes out to the middle of the floor and speaks in a very calm voice. A few customers are on the point of leaving. Rick glances toward Sam, who nods and begins to play. Renault, Strasser, and Heinze sit calmly at their table after witnessing the arrest. Rick walks by, stops, and comes over to their table. Rick nods to Strasser and Heinze and sits down with them. Major Strasser is one of the reasons the Third Reich enjoys the reputation it has today. Strasser takes a little black book from his pocket and turns to a certain page.",
    "895": "A balding undercover officer knocks on the cellblock door. In his cell, Dillinger flips through a magazine and looks up as the balding officer leads Purvis into the cellblock, where other lawmen observe from a side table. Wearing a crisp suit, Purvis faces Dillinger's cell. The gang leader sets down his magazine, stands, and ambles toward the bars. The two men size each other up, with Dillinger curiously cocking his head and Purvis staring calmly. The other officers and agents watch closely. Dillinger's eyes flick up and down the stoic G-man, and he shakes his head with his brow knit. Blinking furtively, Purvis allows a faint smile. Dillinger straightens to his full height, chewing gum and giving a cocky smile. Purvis pauses on his way out, facing Dillinger as sunlight outlines his clean-shaven face, and Dillinger follows Purvis from inside his cell. Both men walk with their hands in pockets, and Purvis barely slows his leisurely stride while inspecting Dillinger, then leaves with his agents. The balding officer stays behind as Dillinger chews his gum. A three-propeller plane cruises through the sky with its curved, boxy underbelly hanging below thick wings, a chevron-shaped windshield jutting behind the nose, and six windows serving as skylights over the cockpit. Later, the plane descends toward a rainy airfield, and on board, Dillinger jostles in his seat as the plane touches down. Outside, the plane taxies past distant hangars, and near one, a man lights a flare, illuminating a vast crowd as two journalists crank movie cameras. A black-and-white view through one camera shows a police officer waiting as Dillinger's plane approaches. Other journalists wait with flashbulb cameras, and three lawmen hold rifles at the ready, gleaming in the flare's light. The plane taxies to a stop as lawmen debark from a car, and another flare goes up. Wind whips two trench-coated lawmen as they escort a shackled Dillinger across the tarmac, with flashbulbs popping. Wearing a button-down shirt and open vest, Dillinger stumbles forward, jostled by his retinue of armed men, his wet bangs dangling over his face. A plume of smoke from a glowing flare billows crookedly in the wind as another view through a movie camera shows the lawmen leading Dillinger through the haze. More flashbulbs pop as the men reach a sedan with a sleek bird-winged hood ornament, and Dillinger gets shoved into the back seat. A jerky hand-held view shows a gunman climbing in next to him. In front, two policemen stand on a car's running boards as it starts off, accompanied by officers on motorbikes. Inside the prisoner's car, Dillinger slouches, his head bobbing while passing lights gleam on the car's polished black hood. Seated between two of his captors, Dillinger keeps his pensive gaze aimed downward.",
    "419": "The game is over. Bert is already in the front room, sitting at a table with a drink, and he watches Eddie pass him by on the way to the bar. Eddie looks at Bert. Amused, Bert gets up and joins Eddie at the bar, laughs, and signals the bartender for another round. He starts to go, and Eddie exits. The sound of a ship's horn is heard as Eddie walks past the piers and warehouses toward a small waterfront bar called Arthur's Pool Hall. The atmosphere at Arthur's is stifling and oppressive, with a few lonely drinkers, dock workers, sitting stooped over their beer bottles at the bar. In the back is a pool table where, as Eddie enters, two burly men with cue sticks in hand are watching a pale, skinny young man line up his shot. They exchange glances, sizing each other up, and then the young man shoots. Eddie goes to the rack and takes a cue, while one of the other players puts away his cue. The young man makes his break shot, slamming the nine into the pocket, and grins snidely at Eddie. The other two men, the losers, stand around, mutely following the play. Eddie tosses a coin on the table and collects it while the young man racks up the balls. Preparing to break, Eddie chalks his cue, rams the cue ball into the pack, and the nine drops in. Everyone, especially the young man, is stunned. Eddie has lost control of himself, shooting like he did at Ames, rapping in shots with perfect control, completely oblivious to the glowering faces of a group of men gathered around the table. Eddie makes a tough shot, and the men exchange uneasy glances as Eddie continues to make more tough shots and tricky combinations. He finishes with another combination shot, and the young man nervously digs into his jacket for the money. All eyes are on Eddie as the young man, sensing what is about to happen, pays up, puts down his cue, drops the cash on the table, and leaves quickly. Then one of the other men, a thick-fleshed, obscene-looking man named Turk, steps forward with a mock smile. As Eddie looks at the circle of silent, glaring men, his fury gives way to fear. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve, nervously backs away, tries to back off but finds nowhere to go, and makes a casual movement toward the table. Turk takes the bills from the table and stuffs them into Eddie's breast pocket. They drag Eddie into the men's room and shove him up against the ground-glass partition.",
    "1288": "The glow of the dawn sky and the lights of three approaching helicopters illuminate the scene as Helen rushes indoors, shocked. She kisses him on the cheek and rushes off, joining Klaatu and Jacob as they leave the house and run for the car through the rain. They abandon the car and run into the dense surrounding woodland, with Klaatu leading the way, Helen struggling to keep up while holding Jacob's hand. They run through the woods as fast as they can as the helicopters thunder overhead. Jacob breaks away from Helen's grasp, and a soldier drops down a rope to snatch Helen. As the two remaining helicopters hover above, Klaatu strides past the stunned Jacob into a clearing and attracts the targeting lasers to the palms of his hands. As they fire, Klaatu reverses the energy flow, causing the pilots to clutch their helmets in agony as the helicopters go out of control, smash into each other, and plunge to the ground, erupting in a huge fireball. Jacob turns and runs back into the woods, with Klaatu following at a leisurely pace. The boy comes to a narrow wooden bridge over a river and, terrified, steps onto the wet planks. As he backs away from the advancing alien, a rocking board breaks under him, but Klaatu reaches out and stops him from falling. Frowning, Klaatu studies Jacob, who looks hopefully up at him. They stare at one another, and then Klaatu strides off, with Jacob hesitating but then following him. Meanwhile, an operative in a protective suit enters the chamber with GORT to repair the drill mechanism, as the agent and ops room staff watch through the window. The chipped drill bit is removed and replaced with a new one. Deep in the minute cracks of the damaged drill, tiny black bugs flutter and multiply by dividing in two. Klaatu glances at the operative, who tightens up the new drill bit and is about to leave when he notices the old drill bit being eaten away. He drops it and hurriedly makes to leave the chamber, but his suit, air canister, and body are being eaten away. The massive steel bands holding GORT are also being eaten, and as the agent watches, the window glass is attacked. A massive jet of flame roars up the chamber, and the operations room staff squint in the intense glare. Flames and smoke clear, but GORT remains, his eyes still glowing. The agent stares in fear as GORT raises his massive hands to show he's free and dissolves into a cloud of bugs filling the flash chamber. The agent bolts for the door, but his pass won't work, while the officer in charge watches grimly as the swirling cloud attacks the windows.",
    "809": "He looks at himself in a mirror. Ferris's hair has light-brown highlights. In an office on a construction site, he speaks to a bald agent posing as a construction worker. Sadiki walks in. As Sadiki and Al-Masri shake hands, Tony takes photographs from a car. Ferris takes the room key from the clerk. He heads upstairs and along a corridor. Ferris lets himself into a hotel room. He walks through the room and out onto the balcony. He climbs over the wall, steps along a ledge, and climbs onto the balcony of the next room. He peers in through the French windows, pushing a long curtain aside. Ferris heads to a laptop on the dressing table. He pushes a device into the socket at the back of the computer. He opens it up. He switches it on and presses some keys. A photo of Sadiki with his family appears on the screen. Ferris dials his cell phone. Garland's at a computer. A number of files appear on the laptop in front of Ferris. In the hotel lobby, Sadiki walks up to the desk and gets his room key. Sadiki walks upstairs to his room. Hearing the door, Ferris quickly shuts the laptop and turns off the desk light. He runs out of the French windows and climbs across to the next balcony. Sadiki walks into the room and gets some money from a bag. He pockets the money. He adjusts the chair in front of the dressing table. He notices the French windows are open and goes to have a look.

    "764": "David turns slowly and looks after her while Elijah is still talking to Audrey. In the stadium, David stands motionless in the center of the walkway, turns slowly, frowning, not really looking at the crowds, and a young man in a bright, blue anorak bumps into him. In the toilets, another young man in a red and blue anorak, wrapped half of his shoulders, washes his hands, turns away from the basin, looks towards the door, and he is alone. He reaches inside a waste bin, extracts a small package, slips it into his trouser pocket, and, hitching up his anorak, walks slowly out. In the walkway, David watches the man in the bright blue anorak join a queue for tickets and approaches him. The man looks at David and slowly turns to face him. The man lifts his arms, and David pats his clothes, puts a hand into one anorak pocket, rummaging around, but comes out with nothing, and steps back. The man looks at him wearily, and David swallows and nods. The man turns away, and David watches him, sighs, and turns to walk in the other direction. David pulls out his walkie-talkie, frowns, and looks back at the man in the anorak, who is also watching him, and the man quickly looks away. Joseph's eyes are on David, who's sitting opposite a white-haired woman at a table. Next to Joseph, sits a boy with a thermometer in his mouth, and Joseph nods, looks pityingly at the other boy. David shakes his head, and shakes his head again, and yet again, and then he swallows, his eyes fixed on the woman, and stares. He and Joseph are outside, humbling through the playground across the colored markings for hopscotch, and Joseph shakes his head as dusk falls outside their house. In the kitchen, David is at the sink, washing up, puts down a pan, and stops, staring at Joseph, who's sitting at a table with David's gun in front of him. Joseph picks up the gun, holds it in both hands, pointing it at David, and the gun lands on the table. David grabs it and quickly removes the bullets while Audrey collapses, leaning on the table, head in hands. David bangs the unloaded gun on the cooker, slides down the wall, and sits slumped against it, while Audrey collapses onto the floor. In the limited edition gallery, he stares down at the carpet in the silver-grey room. Street and shop lights glare in the grey evening as people wait to cross a busy junction. In a shop, Elijah is motionless, glowering and sullen in his wheelchair, and the walls are covered with comics individually wrapped in plastic covers which reflect the light.",
    "273": "As the two men move toward the couch, Ed hesitantly pipes up and she wrinkles her nose apologetically. He is looking at the baby while Gale, Evelle, and Hi look up at Ed, dumbstruck. After a beat, she looks at Hi, and Gale leans in close to Hi, with a look of sincere concern on his face, and says something under his breath. There is an awkward silence as she leaves and slams the bedroom door. Gale is carefully studying his thumbnail while Evelle stares fixedly at the ceiling, and still looking at his thumb, they continue. Sometime later, as Hi tiptoes in, Ed lies in bed facing the wall; we see only the back of her head. Hi sits gingerly on the edge of the bed and, smiling, sticks a finger through the bars of the crib to play with the baby. The sound of the TV set in the living room filters faintly in, and Hi is momentarily startled, then goes on playing with the baby. Ed finally turns to face him, and Hi turns to face her. Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in bed, we are craning down. For a brief moment, we see a wall of flames and hear it roar, still craning down. The wall of flames continues with a deafening roar as we are craning down. The faint National Anthem ends, and we hear the WEEEEEEEE of a test pattern, amidst the roaring. At the cut: WHOOOOOSH! A huge low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames, its engine roaring even louder than the fire. Its driver is a huge leather-clad hellion, and the chains worn by the Biker clank ominously as he rides. The Biker roars out of frame, and as he roars into frame, his rear tire lays down a wake of fire as he roars along a ribbon of desert highway. Tracking with and also in on the Biker from behind as he roars along a strip of highway, he is reaching for the two sawed-off shotguns which are strapped crisscross across his back. Pulling the Biker from a distance as he levels the two shotguns, the tracking camera pulls back further to reveal a running jack-rabbit keeping pace with us in the foreground. CRACK - as the first shotgun spurts orange, the foreground rabbit keels over. The Biker slues the other gun around, and on a rock in the foreground, a desert lizard suns himself. The Biker is approaching in the distant background, and CRACK - from afar, the foreground lizard is blown away. Of the empty desert road stretching away, in the foreground, a lone desert flower blooms. The Biker roars into frame and as he roars away, the foreground flower bends with his draft and then bursts into flame. From behind, booming down as we track, we are approaching the crest of a rise.",
    "471": "The pretty soprano Katherina Cavalieri, around twenty-four years old, dressed in an elaborate mythological Persian costume, sings on stage, near the end of a very florid aria by Salieri, which prompts the audience to applaud wildly. Slyly, he plays the opening measure of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik, and the priest nods, smiling and humming along. Meanwhile, the six-year-old Mozart, also blindfolded, is seated in a gilded chair on a pile of books, playing the harpsichord for the Pope and a suite of Cardinals and other churchmen, with his father Leopold standing beside him, smirking with pride. The piece finishes, and Leopold lowers the lid of the harpsichord and lifts up his little son to stand on it, allowing Mozart to remove the blindfold and reveal his pale little face with staring eyes. Elsewhere, the twelve-year-old Salieri sits between his plump and placid parents in the congregation, listening in rapture, while his father, a heavy-looking, self-approving man, remains obviously indifferent to the music. A large and austere Christ on the cross hangs over the altar. A close-up reveals a large cooked fish on a thick china plate as the camera pulls back to show the Salieri family at dinner; Father Salieri sits at the head of the table with a napkin tucked into his chin as Mother Salieri serves the fish into portions and hands them around. Father Salieri receives his fish plate and starts to eat greedily, but suddenly gasps and chokes violently on a fish bone. All the women get up and crowd around him, thumping and pummeling him, but it is in vain. In a grand room crowded with guests, a small group of Gypsy musicians plays in the background, while thirteen members of the Archbishop's orchestra, all wind players complete with 18th-century wind instruments and wearing their employer's livery, lay out music on stands at one end of the room. Salieri, age thirty-one, a neat, carefully groomed man in decent black clothes and clean white linen, walks among the guests as we follow him until a servant with a large tray of cakes and pastries passes by. Instantly captivated by the sight, Salieri follows the servant out of the Grand Salon, with the man marching along bearing his tray of pastries aloft. Salieri continues to follow him to where several tables, covered to the floor with cloths, are loaded with plates of confectionery. It is, in fact, Salieri's idea of paradise! The servant places his tray on one of the tables and withdraws from the room. Salieri turns away to avoid being noticed by the servant and, as soon as the man disappears, sneaks into the buffet room.",
    "880": "Zoe lies on her bed, her back to Kate. Zoe turns and sits up a little. Aunt and niece stare at one another. Kate looks down, then turns and starts to walk out of the room. Kate gives a faint smile. At the restaurant, Zoe is peeling asparagus spears with three black truffles sitting on one side of her chopping board. Kate puts a plate down beside her and grates a small amount of one of the truffles over her roast quail, then hands the plate to a colleague. Zoe picks up the asparagus trimmings and drops them into a bin, then picks up a truffle, sniffs it, and, screwing her face up in disgust, drops it and the other two into the bin. Kate comes back with a second plate, looks around for the missing truffles, finds them in the bin, and retrieves them. She takes out a yellow lockbox and opens it, revealing even more truffles, and Zoe watches bemused as Kate puts the truffles into it. Watching, Nick smiles to himself and chats to Zoe as he chops onions. Holding a large stainless steel bowl, Zoe kneels down in front of a box of potatoes. Nick picks a couple up and shows them to her; then, while chatting on the phone in the office, Zoe fills the bowls with potatoes and walks off with it. Later, Nick holds a spoonful of sauce out to Zoe; she tastes it and nods her approval. Zoe teaches Nick some dance moves; they punch their arms in the air and point. In the restaurant, Nick dishes out pasta, and the staff tuck in hungrily. Zoe passes a plate to Kate, who tries to pass it on, but her colleague already has a plate, so Kate hands it back to Zoe. Zoe stares at Kate, taps her on the shoulder, and holds the plate out to her. Kate takes it, somewhat reluctantly, and begins to eat. Kate nods and smiles at him warmly. Zoe and Kate are in a park, where Zoe, who's been walking along park benches next to Kate, stops and leans across to whisper in Kate's ear. Zoe jumps down and walks ahead. In the restaurant, Nick heads into the kitchen, donning his white apron. Later, Kate draws back a curtain to look down at Zoe, who is pacing on the wintry street outside the apartment. Kate smiles and goes down. Zoe stands on a stool in the bathroom, plaiting her hair, then runs to the apartment door, flings it open, and heads downstairs. Nick checks Kate's cupboards, Kate takes a box from his bag, and Zoe ushers Kate out of the kitchen. Nick shows Zoe how to make a pizza base.",
    "77": "Rachel's head bobs up and down above the bush as we hear the unmistakable sound of a female hand on a child's bottom; all carry baskets as Rachel charges along at the head of the procession, while a cattle dealer strolls the other way. She keeps walking as they walk in silence. The waitress hurries away as Rachel dodges past a car, following the waitress and then the lovers in the car with her eyes. She takes in the lovers and sighs, angry at all women, herself included, and turns away. At the grocery store, the grocer is on his doorstep as she starts into the store with him; Rachel and the grocer come up to the counter where she stands with her market basket, reacting to wolf whistles off-screen, seeking the world. Ruby gestures Rachel’s nearness and nods as he turns and goes; Ruby, with an eye to the first loafer, turns and follows. John has entered in the background where Pearl holds the doll to her, and John moves in quietly to her side, standing together as they have often done before. As he turns around, she continues, puts aside the book, and takes up her mending, mending for a few moments as John crosses behind her and off towards the door. He approaches with two apples, gives her an apple, makes a move, and slowly and tenderly reaches out his hand, laying his fingers on her knuckles. Our heroine would like to thank the Lord openly but knows she must not show her feelings, so she speaks gruffly. Maybe we see, though John does not, the thanksgiving in her eyes as her head and shoulders from behind appear walking down the neon-lighted street, with the drugstore and loafers in the background and jazz music off-screen. Our two loafers lounge on a bench as Ruby approaches; he gets up and starts walking towards Ruby, catching his eye. She turns to a magazine stand and fingers a magazine, awaiting the loafer who approaches in the background; they are lurid, tawdry fan and pin-up magazines. The preacher enters between Ruby and the loafer and turns to Ruby into a close two-shot as the loafer pauses in the background. She looks up at him admiringly, then to the loafers, back to Ruby finishing her soda, which is a familiar clue to the preacher, who then nods. It slides into his knife pocket as she looks after him, clasping the magazine under her chin, her hero strides away into darkness, gazing after him. Ruby collapses facedown over Rachel's lap and sobs as they weep together. She starts making up Ruby's hair like that of a young woman as Ruby nods and shrugs. Seeing the preacher, she drops two eggs. He tethers his horse and, as we pan and track on behind him, walks to the bottom of the steps as Ruby moves into the side of the shot; beyond the preacher, Rachel stands behind her screen door, hands folded under her apron.",
    "245": "Zed continues his silent sing-song with his finger moving left to right, then it stops. After a beat, the camera moves to the right, zeroing in on Marsellus. Zed stands up, grabs Marsellus' chair, and drags him into Russell's old room. As Marsellus is dragged away, he locks eyes with Butch before disappearing behind the door of Russell's old room. Butch looks at The Gimp, who giggles from underneath the mask as if this were the funniest moment in the history of comedy. Zed's hand inches toward the weapon, while Butch grips the sword tighter. Zed studies Butch, who looks hard at Zed. Butch steps aside, revealing Marsellus standing behind him, holding Maynard's pump-action shotgun. Zed is blasted in the groin and goes down screaming in agony. Marsellus, looking down at his whimpering rapist, ejects the used shotgun shell. Butch lowers the sword and hangs back, then leaves Russell's old room through the red curtains. Fabienne slowly approaches the two-wheel demon as Butch looks at her. Fabienne starts to cry, and Butch turns off the engine and reaches out, taking her hand. Fabienne climbs on, and Butch starts her up. With that, the two lovebirds peel away. Meanwhile, we're in the bathroom of the Hollywood apartment we were in earlier with the Fourth Man, who is pacing around the small room, listening hard to what's being said on the other side of the door, clutching his huge silver .357 Magnum. The Fourth Man freaks out, throws himself against the back wall with the gun outstretched in front of him, a look of fear on his face, ready to blow in half anybody fool enough to stick their head through that door, then listens to them talk. Bursting out the door and blowing them all away while they're fooling around is the way to go. The bathroom door bursts open, and the Fourth Man charges out, silver Magnum raised, firing six booming shots from his hand cannon. Jules rises, moving toward Vincent as Vincent prepares to leave. Jules is behind the wheel, Vincent in the passenger seat, and Marvin in the back. Vincent turns to the backseat with the .45 casually in his grip. Vincent's .45 goes bang, and Marvin is hit in the upper chest, below the throat. He gurgles blood and shakes. Later, Jules is bent over a sink, washing his bloody hands, while Vincent stands behind him. Jules rises and dries his hands, and Vincent takes his place at the sink. Vincent finishes, dries his hands on a white towel, and when he is finished, the towel is stained with red. Three men are standing in Jimmie's kitchen, each with a mug of coffee.",
    "164": "She fights loose, but one of the constables takes her firmly. The sergeant turns from the commotion to see that Gandhi, his head oozing blood, has crawled to his knees again and is picking up another card. The crowd watches. The newspaper reporter watches. Ba stares in anguish. Gandhi lifts the card. The sergeant stares at him, angry but his emotions somewhat in control after the first blow. An instant of hesitation, then Gandhi drops the card into the basket. The sergeant almost stops, but he strikes again. A quiver of distaste at his own act crosses his face as Gandhi sags. Ba's anguished face is wet with tears. The newspaper reporter stares without making notes. Khan, at the paddy wagon, watches in wonder. Gandhi, his head bleeding badly now, rises to his knees -- a breath and he gropes around the ground for another card. His fingers finally clutch one. The sergeant stares, his face wracked with uncertainty and confusion. Gandhi lifts the card and painfully holds it over the fire, then drops it in the basket. The sergeant slams the billy club down again -- firmly, but with a manifest reluctance. The crowd watches breathlessly, the newspaper reporter stares. The sergeant draws a breath, grasping the club, but he bites his lip as he sees Gandhi lift his head feebly, his shaking hands, stained with his own blood, groping for another card. Ba is gently removing Gandhi's suit coat, staring fearfully at a bandage on his head, another along the side of his face. The room is gas lit, over furnished in the Victorian manner. Gandhi sits carefully on the bed, where some newspapers are spread out, English-language ones among them. Ba reaches forth, gently touching the bandages on his head. Before Gandhi can retort there is a knock on the door. A small, round ayah (an Indian nursemaid) pushes open the door and proudly admits her charges, Gandhi's sons: Harilal (ten), Manilal (six), and Ramdas (two). They are all dressed in European suits, ties, and stiff collars. They step forward, one by one, making the pranam (the Hindu gesture of greeting), then bending and touching the hands and lips to Gandhi's feet in the traditional obeisance of child to father. Gandhi smiles. And Ramdas runs to him and Gandhi bends to kiss him as Ramdas puts his arms around his neck. The boys bow and leave like boys used to household discipline. The ayah closes the door and we hear their chatter as they go down the hall. Gandhi is stretching out on the bed, taking up another paper. Ba comes and sits down on the bed beside him, maneuvering so that she can get at the bandage.",
    "462": "Nearby are some stone ruins that once might have been a fort but now kind of resemble Stonehenge. The Man in Black is 75 feet from the top, maybe less—maybe only 50—and his pace is as dazzling as before. Vizzini cuts through the last of the rope, which slithers across the ground and out of sight toward the Channel like some great serpent at last going home. Fezzik stands with Inigo and Buttercup by the cliff edge. The Man in Black hangs suspended hundreds of feet in the air, holding to the jagged rocks, desperately trying to cling to life. Vizzini, stunned, turns to the others, looking down at the Man in Black, who very slowly picks his way upwards, sometimes a foot at a time, sometimes an inch. The group at the top is staring down, and Inigo nods. The Man in Black continues to creep his way upward. Fezzik goes to Inigo, nods, and hurries after Vizzini. Inigo watches them depart, then turns, peers down over the cliffs, watches a moment, and then paces, shaking his hands loose. He practices a few of his honed fencing skills, as he is a taut and nervous fellow who has never been one for waiting around. The Man in Black climbs on, and he must be six inches closer to the top than when last seen. Inigo is watching, then walking away. Finally, he goes back to the cliff edge and starts to talk. It's instant death if the Man in Black falls, but neither gives that possibility much credence. This is our two heroes meeting. The Man in Black glances up, kind of grunts, as Inigo steps away, draws his sword, and loosens up with a few perfect thrusts, then re-sheathes and looks eagerly over the edge again. The Man in Black just hangs there in space, resting, gathering his strength. On these words, the camera zooms into a close-up on Inigo, who raises his right hand high, his eyes blazing, and his voice takes on a tone not heard before. Then, quietly, he dashes to the giant rock the rope was originally tied to. The Man in Black loosens his grip a moment, trying to cling to the side of the cliff. Inigo, now with a small coil of rope, hurries back to the edge and hurls it over. It hangs close to the Man in Black, who releases the rocks, grabs the rope, hangs helplessly in space a moment, then looks up at Inigo. Inigo strains, forcing his body away from the cliff edge, as the Man in Black rises through the early morning light, slowly, steadily, and as the cliff top at last comes within reach, Inigo is watching as the Man in Black crawls to safety, then looks to Inigo.",
    "679": "Looking scared, Harry hauls back a hinged portrait, dials a combination, and opens the safe behind it. Inside is a huge orb. A limb bundles Harry out of the way. Octavius strides up to the safe, removes his dark specs, and stares at the tritium. Harry fixes his eyes on Spider-Man. He spins round. Octavius has taken the tritium sphere and leaves via the balcony. Harry, a dark and brooding look on his face, picks up a heavy ornamental dagger from the desk beside him. He holds the dagger to his chest and moves towards the unconscious Spider-Man, lying on his back on the couch, his arms and hands bound in front of him. He raises the dagger as Spider-Man stares. He hauls off the mask, then recoils and drops the dagger. Peter flexes and breaks the bonds. He gets to his feet and approaches Harry. Harry shakes his head. There are tears in the seated Harry's eyes as he stares up at Peter. In the reconstructed lab, down by the pier, Octavius stands in the fusion chamber, studying the tritium. MJ, in chains, is tied to a pillar. Octavius lowers his dark glasses and taps on a keyboard. In the fusion chamber, beams of light appear. The tritium glows brightly, illuminating the way for Spider-Man to creep across a beam. Sensing something, Octavius grins. Spider-Man stops above MJ. MJ looks up, smiles, and her smile fades when she turns to face Octavius. A limb punches into the pillar. Spider-Man climbs away. Spider-Man jumps over Octavius and his limbs, but they catch him and fling him up through the ceiling and out into the night sky. Spider-Man shoots a web onto the building and swings back in through a huge oil window, landing on Octavius. They crash through the floorboards into the water below and trade blows. The tritium sphere begins to attract metals to it, including MJ's chains. She hangs in the air, the chains on her leg drawn to the sphere. The pillar to which she's tied buckles and the ropes become free. MJ is pulled towards the sphere. Spider-Man attaches a web to the rope and struggles to pull MJ back from the glowing tritium. The chains on her legs break free and she catapults back to Spider-Man. Octavius is back on the rampage. He tosses Spider-Man against a metal beam. He crashes to the floor, and MJ watches as rubble falls on top of him. Octavius strides over, and one of the limbs lifts Spider-Man and suspends him in mid-air. MJ picks up a piece of timber, sneaks up on Octavius, and is about to hit him when she's punched away. One pincer flicks out a blade.",
    "1226": "The Beast is now gleaming as she approaches with an unconvinced smile. Emily reaches for the switch, and her eyes widen as she looks at Ben in awe as the fly wheels turn. Emily presses down a lever, and the piston arms pump, picking up paper, setting it on the platen, and printing on it. Emily watches in amazement, then wraps her arms around Ben's neck and hugs him tight. Ben gradually responds to her touch, rests his head on her shoulder, closes his eyes, and lays his hands on her back. A tearful Emily nuzzles into him, and Ben stands back, gently drawing her to him and planting a lingering kiss on her lips. Emily brushes her fingers against Ben's cheek as they continue kissing passionately. They break off and stand with their foreheads together. Ben pulls back a little and kisses her fingertips. Ben hurries out of the workshop, steps over the low picket fence, goes to unlock his car, and takes out the gift. His brother, Ben, now Tim, goes to his car and reaches in for the ID, which he hands to his brother, Ben. Tim, who has put his gift back in the car, looks sheepish while the real Ben considers uneasily for a moment. Tim reaches into his jeans' pocket and hands them over, then walks briskly back towards the house, breaking into a jog. He steps back over the picket fence and returns to the workshop, where Emily sits in a sultry pose, waiting for him. Emily stands, and shuffling uneasily, Tim reluctantly moves away from Emily's touch. Ever-persistent, she draws his face to her and kisses his cheek. Tim calms a little and lets her kiss his cheek several more times. Cupping his face in her hands, Emily kisses Tim on the lips, and Tim remains motionless with his eyes closed but gradually begins to kiss her back as tears roll down his cheeks. The couple wrap their arms tightly around each other as they continue to kiss with mounting passion. Emily's arms are around Tim's neck as he lifts her legs and holds her in his arms. They kiss again, and Tim carries her out of the workshop. Tim and Emily, still kissing, fall back on gold satin pillows, and Tim kneels astride Emily, who helps him off with his polo shirt. She sees a long scar running from his side and back. In golden light, Emily slips off her delicate sandals and undoes the clasp on her halterneck dress. She and Tim move slowly into a tender kiss, and Tim lays a hand gently on a scar on Emily's naked breast and kisses it. Outside, rain streaks a window, making the image of the kissing couple inside hazy.",
    "472": "Salieri enters the room and looks about him cautiously. He is salivating with anticipation as he stares at the feast of sweet things. His attention is attracted in particular by a huge pile of dark chocolate balls arranged in the shape of a pineapple. He reaches out a hand to steal one of the balls, but at the same moment, he hears giggling coming toward him and ducks down behind the pastry table. A girl, Constanze, rushes into the room, runs straight across it, and hides herself behind one of the tables. After a beat of total silence, Mozart, age twenty-six, wearing a fine wig and a brilliant coat with the insignia of the Archbishop of Salzburg upon it, runs into the room, stops, and looks around, puzzled that Constanze has disappeared. Watched by an astonished Salieri, Mozart disappears under the cloth and obviously pounces upon Constanze. The throng is mostly seated; the musicians are in their places, holding their various exotic-looking wind instruments, and the candles are all lit. Immediately, Colloredo, Prince-Archbishop of Salzburg, enters. He is a small self-important figure of fifty in a wig, surmounted by a scarlet skullcap, and is followed by his Chamberlain, the Count Arco. Everyone stands as the Archbishop goes to his throne and sits. Instead, a wind musician gets up, approaches the Chamberlain, and whispers in his ear. They roll on the floor as he tries to drag her back under the table. The mood becomes suddenly softer as she kisses him, and they embrace. Shocked, she strikes at him, and he leaps up, disheveled and rumpled, and runs out of the room. Salieri watches in amazement and disgust. Mozart hastens towards the Grand Salon away from the buffet room, adjusting his dress as he goes. The opening of the Serenade is being tentatively conducted by the leader of the wind-musicians. Guests turn around as Mozart appears, bows to the Archbishop, and walks with an attempt at dignity to the dais where the wind band is playing. The leader yields his place to the composer, and Mozart smoothly takes over conducting. Constanze, deeply embarrassed, sneaks into the room and seats herself at the back. Salieri stands shocked from his inadvertent eavesdropping. Mozart is conducting the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists. Salieri appears at the door at the back of the salon and stares in disbelief at Mozart. The audience is clearly delighted, and Mozart bows to them, also delighted. He does it with a furious grace, then leaves the room. A group of people who have attended the concert, among them Constanze, are standing outside the private apartment. At sight of the composer, they break into sustained applause.",
    "130": "Gandhi starts to go down, and others around him, convinced by the authority of his voice, follow suit. The sense of the idea seizes Gandhi, and as the sound of the galloping horses nears, he turns and shouts too. The miners begin to go down, some face up, shielding their faces with their hands, some burying their faces in the earth and covering their heads with their hands. The sergeant's point of view shows a close fast traveling shot to the prone miners. Close on Gandhi, we see his arms crossed in front of his face, staring up, frightened but determined to bear it. The horses cannot bring themselves to gallop over the human carpet; they rear, plunge, and swerve. Gandhi turns to see the sergeant thrown off his horse, landing heavily, scrambling up, furious, and darting after it. Mounting again, the sergeant is enraged to hear laughter. Gandhi's command, angry in its own way but carrying all the weight of his influence, causes them to begin to go down again. The sergeant wheels his horse and rides at Gandhi. With a deliberate, almost fatalistic pace, Gandhi goes first to his knees and then sprawls down flat, his hands over the top of his head, awaiting the blow of the horse's hoof. A close shot of the horse's head shows its eyes rolling as it swerves again, while the sergeant, cursing, is unable to make it plunge down on the man. Surveying the whole procession sprawled on the ground, the sergeant, angrily wheeling his horse, sees his mounted police circling in front of them, unsure of what to do. He turns his horse angrily and gallops back toward the factories. Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed look off at the retreating horses. The car with the civilian has returned in the distance, and the sergeant wheels by it as his police turn their horses, lining up across the road again. Gandhi and the miners come on once more, chanting forcefully. Meanwhile, a congregation listens stiffly and unsympathetically to a clergyman who has given Charlie the use of his pulpit and sits beneath it, embarrassed but resolute. As Charlie struggles on, a few men in the congregation rise, escorting their families from the church, with more members rising and marching out, though a few pointedly do not. Gandhi threads his way in a line for soup, which winds through masses of prisoners, some with bowls, eating, some not yet in line. As Gandhi nears the two stone blocks holding the large barrels of soup, he sees that Khan is serving from one of them.",
    "1135": "The Minister's eyes flit from Harry to Ron, then to Hermione. The wedding reception is in full swing. A soft light spills out of the marquis. A group of men keep guard outside as Lupin strolls past them. Harry stands in the covered walkway, the Snitch hovering beside him, which he grasps and puts in his jacket pocket before entering the marquis. Fleur and Bill are dancing together between two lines of guests, with butterflies fluttering around them. Harry smiles as glasses magically fill with Champagne. Standing beside the table is tall, dark-haired Madame Maxime, and Hagrid looks up at her admiringly. A man with long white blonde hair dances theatrically with Luna Lovegood, and Ron stares while Hermione appears looking delightful in a sleeveless red dress. Harry spots Elphias Doge and heads towards him. Luna's father wears a pendant with a triangle containing a circle with a vertical line through it. Harry sits with Elphias, and an old woman scowls, prompting Harry to look puzzled. A bright white light appears in the sky, and Harry rises with his eyes fixed on the approaching light as the guests draw back. The light bursts into the marquis, and images and voices emerge from the hovering light, causing the guests to freeze. The images disappear, and Bill comforts Fleur as Elphias disapparates upon Death Eaters' arrival. They attack the guests, and Ron grabs Hermione while Harry heads for Ginny, only to be stopped by Lupin. Harry, Hermione, and Ron apparate in London, with Ron and Harry holding Hermione's hands as they follow her across Piccadilly Circus and down a crowded street to a dingy alley where they stand in a doorway. Hermione puts her hand into her small, bottomless handbag and pulls out clothes. They sit at a table in a cafe as a waitress comes over, wearing earphones, then struts off. Two men enter, and Hermione indicates her bag. The men fire wands, and in the kitchen, the waitress with the earphones sings to her music. One man is down as Hermione and Ron aim at the second behind the counter, who misses Hermione, and she then takes aim, causing him to fall. The waitress comes out of the kitchen and gapes, then scurries back. Ron uses the Deluminator to absorb the light from the lamps while Hermione uses her wand to lower shutters. He strokes her cheek, and Hermione moves slowly towards the dark-haired man in overalls lying on the floor, his body stiffened and unmoving. She points her wand with a shaking hand as her arm wavers and the tip glows, with Dolohov's eyes remaining open and starry. Later, they walk through a covered arcade until Hermione suddenly stops. In Grimmauld Place, they watch as Number 12, a tall terraced house, slides into position, and they enter the Black family home.",
    "150": "Irwin has listened and it's beginning to make a little sense, causing the principal secretary to blanch. Irwin looks at his ADC, paces a bit, and ponders it, and then after a moment of consideration, the general speaks. Irwin turns to him and this makes up his mind; he is concerned enough to be angry, but certain enough to be dogmatic. Suddenly, a mass of people hidden by the embankment appear at the top of the steps coming up from the river, followed by a long tendril of humanity stretching across the river to the distant outskirts of the city. Around the ashram, many fires are burning, people cook breakfast, some pack knapsacks for the journey, and others strew the path with leaves. It is quiet, with just the buzz of activity from outside the building. Gandhi grins at Mirabehn, who is massaging his legs, and smiles before turning back toward his bungalow. Ba and Mirabehn stand watching with Desai, and Gandhi holds their gaze a second before turning and starting forward. Pyarelal takes a position next to him, and the marchers follow. As they move along the path, a thinner crowd appears, while two police cars with several policemen, including a British officer, a British sergeant, and four Indian constables, are drawn up to one side. As Gandhi nears the police, Walker moves beside him, and some newspaper cameramen trot behind to capture Gandhi's arrest. Collins is among the newsmen, featuring Gandhi, Walker, and Pyarelal just behind, glancing at the police who are now quite near. Walker smiles uneasily as they near the police, and Gandhi nods amiably to them in passing. Walker turns to watch for a police move but begins to grasp that none may come; he hurries closer to Gandhi, keeping an eye on the police. Gandhi glances at Walker, who also wears a knapsack, and he nods politely to the British police officer at the end of the line. Walker stops, letting the procession pass, looks at the officer, and writes busily in his notebook, with Collins stopping by him. The scene shifts to a dusty approach to a dusty village, lined with peasants holding flower petals and leaves and gazing expectantly down the road. Behind them, the village is decorated with green, white, and saffron colors of Independence, and two large policemen stand arms-akimbo at the front, their postures imposing and threatening, though somewhat softened by the children skirting around them.",
    "638": "Graham halts, raises the torch, and peers into the tunnel of foliage ahead. He spins round, aiming the torch beam into the impenetrable jungle on one side but finding nothing, the light hardly passing beyond the first few rows of woody green stalks. He then lowers the flashlight to his side and begins to pick his way through the crop, one arm raised to shield his face from the leaves. Emerging in the first of the crop circles, Graham lowers his arm gently and comes to a gradual stop, viewing the area with renewed concern. A pale gray light fills the vast perfect circle of evenly flattened corn, and the leaves glow with a silvery sheen. Graham stands still, his torch shooting a slender shaft of light across the circle. His eyes dart about. Graham swallows and takes a steadying breath. He scans the circle apprehensively, then steps backwards towards the standing crop. Turning at the last moment, he cuts straight into the corn, struggling through the unbending forest until he stumbles out onto a pathway running between two areas of maize. Graham shines his torch along the path. It's clear. He then turns and points the beam the other way. Again, nothing. He stares into the crop. Whipping round, he drops the torch and the light goes out. Panting and keeping his eyes fixed intently on the maize, he crouches down warily and reaches for the torch. Locating the flashlight, he frantically slaps the lens and the beam returns, briefly illuminating his face. He shines the light down the path; a long thin bare leg slips silently into the corn. Graham scrabbles backwards, then leaps up and sprints off in the opposite direction. He plows into the corn and charges through it, the torch light dancing over the leaves as he runs. In the farmhouse, Morgan and Bo are washing up at the sink in the kitchen, which opens directly onto the lounge. Merrill sits at a table with his back to them, reading the army pamphlet he picked up in town and lazily chewing gum. Unnoticed by the other three, Graham pads softly into the kitchen and stops. He lowers himself gently into a seat at the table, his two children turning around to see their father staring at the floor. Morgan steps falteringly up to the table, leaving Bo at the sink. Merrill then peers casually over his shoulder and notices his downcast brother. Getting up, he heads into the kitchen, stopping just short of the table. Graham looks at Merrill, then sits up straight and sighs. On the screen, lights hover in a night sky. Graham and Merrill sit on the sofa while Morgan and Bo kneel close to the TV.",
    "420": "His cheek is pressed against the glass, with the foggy silhouettes of the others behind him. Eddie's mouth is open as he screams horribly. He screams again, and they let go of his arms, causing him to slump to the floor. The bartender turns and goes back to the bar in the front room as the ship's horn is heard again. There is a knock at the door. Sarah sits alone in the darkened room, dressed in her robe and slip, lost in a drunken half-sleep. She goes to the door and opens it, her eyes puffy and her face covered with perspiration. She looks up to see him leaning against the wall, his arms tucked into his chest, with one hand covering the other. Sarah is stunned and moves to him, taking him in her arms. He starts to cry, and she holds him. Sarah watches as Eddie, both hands encased in plaster casts, tries to sleep and moves his arms as if trying to defend himself. Sarah rises, joins him, and strokes his head. They are seated at the breakfast table, where Sarah pours him some coffee. He tries to bring the cup to his lips but cannot manage it, and in disgust, he drops the cup on the floor and gets up from the table. Sarah bends down and patiently wipes up the spilled coffee. The apartment is now clean and neat, and Sarah is sober. She is at her table typing, while Eddie stands at the window, trying to reach over his shoulder to scratch his back. He comes over to the table and picks a cigarette out of the pack with his mouth, looking quickly at her without asking directly for the match. She lights it, and as she does, he glances at the sheet in the typewriter. He starts to unbutton his shirt, but when Sarah immediately gets up to help, he holds her off. She watches him struggle with the button for a while, then spreads his arms in a gesture of helplessness. As she unbuttons his shirt for him, he takes her face in his hands and kisses her. Sarah and Eddie emerge from the doorway. It is a warm, beautiful day, and Sarah has a basket with her. Eddie seems happy to be out with her, almost as if he has forgotten the casts on his hands. They stop at a spot that overlooks the river and spread out a blanket. Eddie leans back on the grass and looks at Sarah, and they both seem easy and relaxed in the sunshine together. Eddie lowers his eyes and leans back, then just stares at her before he is about to knock on the door to Sarah's apartment.",
    "184": "The camera moves in on Laurie as a teacher drones away at the front of the room, and then it moves to a close-up of her. Laurie barely listens to the teacher as she doodles in her notebook and lets her gaze move to a window where she stares dreamily outside. From the window, she can see the street and a station wagon parked along the sidewalk, with the shape of a man standing behind it. Laurie turns away from the window and begins to doodle again before springing around from the window. She sneaks a glance back to the window, but the shape and the station wagon are gone. She turns back from the window to her notebook. Meanwhile, other boys form a circle around Tommy and taunt him. A car is parked in front of a small, closed-down gas station/diner by the side of the highway. The camera slowly tracks over to a phone booth where Loomis is inside on the telephone. Annie comes out of the side doors of the high school and calls after Laurie and Lynda, and the girls stop and wait for her. Laurie suddenly stops and looks back toward the school, then glances down the street where the station wagon slowly moves up toward them, with the shape not visible behind the windshield. Laurie stares at the station wagon as it moves past, looking directly at the shape inside, catching a quick glimpse of a strange pale face staring back. The shape is close to the camera, out of focus, staring at Laurie, then tromps on the accelerator, whizzing past them. Out the window, the three girls are seen on the sidewalk and up the street, the wagon suddenly stops, sitting there waiting. For a moment, the station wagon just sits there, then it takes off down the street and disappears around a corner. The girls start walking again and eventually stop in front of Lynda's house, a modest suburban home on a quiet, tree-lined street. Lynda strolls up to her house while Annie and Laurie start down the street. Up the sidewalk is a series of bushes lining the street, and the camera moves in to a close shot of Laurie's face as she stares ahead along the sidewalk where, partially hidden in the shadows of a bush, is the shape of a man watching them, barely visible and almost blending in with the dark foliage. The shape is gone, revealing just bushes. Annie walks right over to the bushes and kicks them hard while Laurie stands on the sidewalk several feet from the bushes, then slowly walks over and stares at the bush.",
    "219": "The four men sit about listening to a big box radio as Wash is whittling, Everett dips his comb into a pomade jar and carefully works on his hair, Pete is digging around with a toothpick, and Delmar dreamily waves one hand in time to the music. Everett clears his throat and screws the lid back on the pomade. They are sleeping in a hayloft, with Everett wearing a hairnet over his painstakingly arranged hair, when a spotlight plays over the hayloft ceiling and a voice booms, rousing the three men. From high, we see a foreshortened lawman holding a bullhorn surrounded by armed deputies, with a tin-starred sheriff watching impassively through mirrored sunglasses, a bloodhound drooling at his side. Pete screams down from the hayport as RAT-A-TAT-A-TAT- Everett pulls Pete down when a tommy gun spits lead into the hayloft. Enraged, Pete grabs a flaming faggot and hurls it down at the deputized congregation, but it lands harmlessly in some scattered straw. The drum of one starts spinning, flames lick up the outside of the van as - chinka-chinka-chinka - bullet holes walk across the body. Yelling men scurry away as the vehicle rocks and chatters under the force of the many tommy guns now firing inside, with tires popping, hissing, and settling, doors popping open, and glass shattering. Pete, Everett, and Delmar pile in, the doors slam shut, and the boy grinds into gear with wood blocks strapped to his feet to reach the accelerator, brake, and clutch, sitting on a Sears Roebuck catalogue to give him a view over the dash. The car speeds for the far wall, sheeted in flame, and bursts through. The little Hogwallop boy walks away in long shot down the middle of the empty road, his walk unsteady with the wood blocks still strapped to his feet. He turns to face us and hollers, as Pete enters in the foreground and throws a dirt clod at the boy, which lands shy as Pete yells. We pan Pete over to the shoulder where the car is stopped, its hood propped open, with Everett and Delmar looking at the engine. Everett pushes a small tin across the counter, stunned, and then picks up the tin. On a wooded hillside, they sit at a twig fire, roasting a small creature on a spit, and Everett stalks into frame, plopping disgustedly down by the fire, grimly shaking his head as he scrapes the last of it onto his comb and starts combing his hair. Everett fishes a gold watch from his pocket and tosses it to Pete, who looks at the watch, puzzled, pops the front, and reads the inscription.",
    "802": "On the screen, the vehicles and men are obscured by a large cloud of dust, and a robe is thrown at Ferris's feet before a black hood is put over his head. Barefoot, Ferris is manhandled into one of the vehicles, and the four SUVs drive off in different directions. They emerge from the cloud of dust, and Hoffman watches the vehicles go their separate ways as one of the SUVs speeds off down a road. An SUV stops in front of a stone building, where armed men open a large gate, and Ferris, still hooded, is dragged through the entrance. A man shines a torch into a dark cell, where Ferris is sitting on the floor with his ankles and wrists bound with cable ties. The man lifts Ferris's hood and holds a cup of water to his lips, tipping the cup so Ferris drinks. His ankles are bound to the chair legs by cable ties, and men escort Al-Saleem along dark passageways by torchlight. Ferris sits at a table with the black hood over his head, and his hands are secured to the tabletop with cable ties, palms down, while armed men stand guard. A harsh white light shines in the otherwise gloomy room, and on the wall behind Ferris is a black cloth with a gold disk and Arabic script on it. Al-Saleem walks in past a group of men, one of whom sits by a video camera focused on Ferris, and then Al-Saleem sits. The hood is pulled off Ferris's head, and he stares at Al-Saleem, who returns his gaze benignly and waves his finger before turning to the cameraman to say, \"Turn on the camera.\" Ferris sees Karami amongst the men observing and remembers Hani embracing Karami in the desert. Al-Saleem stands and picks up a hammer from a table of tools and hits Ferris' little finger, which snaps and spurts blood, causing Ferris to spit in Al-Saleem's face. Al-Saleem wipes it with his hand and hammers another finger before dropping the hammer and walking out. The men gather around Ferris, who hangs his head, and as Al-Saleem walks away down the gloomy corridors, he wipes his hands on a cloth. The executioner, a man wearing a black cloak and hat, yanks Ferris's head up by his hair, spits in his face, and slams Ferris’ face down on the table. Al-Saleem and one of his men head downstairs and through a market, while Ferris, with his nose and mouth bloody, heaves and shifts within his ties. Ferris' ties are cut, and the men pull him to the floor. He kicks and struggles as they lift him, and the camera keeps filming as Ferris is lifted onto the table, face down. Ferris is flipped onto his back and keeps struggling, but the men hold him spread-eagled on the table.",
    "361": "Gandalf stands quietly on a balcony that overlooks the great city as Pippin stares up at the vast night sky. Gandalf watches the young hobbit and then joins Pippin as they look towards the distant, jagged mountains of Mordor. Pippin, unnerved, looks up at Gandalf, who gives him a small self-deprecating smile. Together, Gandalf and Pippin share a quiet moment as they stare out towards the fiery sky over Mordor. Giant Mumakil carry armies upon their backs, and Corsair ships sail up the river. Almost talking to himself, like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster, Gandalf observes the battle-scarred city of Osgiliath, the last bastion between Minas Tirith and Mordor. Pippin desperately seeks reassurance, but Gandalf looks down at him without saying anything and stares into the distance as if seeing something in his mind's eye. A towering, hooded figure dressed in black is being armored by attendant orcs as Gandalf continues to stare intently as if facing his enemy in person. Pippin looks up at Gandalf, afraid to ask, while he recalls Frodo screaming as the Morgul blade is driven into his shoulder, and Pippin blanches at the memory. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam clamber into a small gully beside a rough-hewn road as Gollum carefully peers over the lip of the gully. Minas Morgul, a massive dead city set upon a rocky knee at the head of the Morgul Valley, glows with a sickly luminous light like a corpse candle, and two huge, bestial stone statues guard the bridge leading to the city. Gollum, Frodo, and Sam hurry from their cover, scampering in the shadows towards Minas Morgul. Frodo looks up at the hideous statues, and he and Sam are aghast at the sight of a narrow, near-vertical staircase cut into the rock face directly in front of the Minas Morgul gates, leading higher and higher up the sheer western side of the Morgul Valley to the high peaks of the razor-like mountains of Mordor. Suddenly, Frodo staggers across the road as if some force other than his own will is at work, lurching toward the bridge and Minas Morgul. Sam runs after Frodo, catching him in his arms as he stumbles, and with Gollum's help, pulls Frodo from the bridge before Frodo falls to the ground. At that moment, the ground quivers, and a great rumbling noise rolls across and echoes in the mountains. The cold, dull Morgul Valley becomes violent and fierce as uprushing flames spring from Mount Doom. Minas Morgul responds with a flare of livid lightning, forks of blue flame springing up from the tower into the sullen cloud, and violent fiery flashes light the cloud above Mordor as sharp thunder rolls across 40 miles to Minas Tirith.",
    "622": "Juno, wearing the adapted jeans, comes down the school with her hands long in the pockets of her baggy tartan parker as her fellow students, staring at her belly, clear a path to let her pass. Mark is at home composing. In the school canteen, the two girls eat their lunch in an empty school awards booth while Leah gazes adoringly at the tubby bearded teacher. At his locker, Bleeker knocks back as Juno waddles up to him and looks him straight in the eye. Bleeker's eye shift as he glances in Katrina's direction, and his head drops miserably. Juno strides away with her canvas bag over her shoulder, leaving Bleeker standing by his locker, watching her glumly. Juno hoists herself up into her dad's Previa, puts on some lip balm, and starts the engine. Meanwhile, Mark, surfing on his PC, sees the blue van pull up outside as Juno follows him downstairs, and he leads her into a cluttered basement room. She reads a title and her hands grab his waist. He brings the up to his neck, and with his hands round her waist, her belly touching his, she closes her eyes and rests her head on his chest as they slowly sway together. Mark, with his chin brushing against her hair, seems unsettled as Juno looks up startled and stares at him in bewilderment. Vanessa, loaded down with shopping, comes into her pristine white kitchen while Mark lowers his gaze. Juno starts to go and bolts out of the door, clutching her belly as she waddles out to the Previa. Mark, in his rock T-shirt over a long-sleeved undershirt, looks coldly at Vanessa and goes back to his room, and Vanessa sinks down on the stairs and gazes unhappily into space. Beneath a cloudy sky, Juno drives under a road bridge, passing a freight train on one side. She pulls off the main carriageway onto the soft shoulder, next to a sward of dull green grass dotted with patches of spring snow, runs her hand over her own belly as she gives into tears, and crammed in behind the wheel, seems oblivious of the passing cars as she rubs her belly under her thick tartan coat, her eyes staring straight ahead, not looking at anything in particular, and she starts to calm down. The car lights flash, and she pulls back onto the road and drives off. Up in his room, Bleeker is playing his guitar after dark. On the bonnet of the van, with her head resting on the sloping front windscreen and her hands tucked behind her back, Juno stares up at the sky. She suddenly raises herself onto her elbows, climbs back into the van, rummages behind her to find a crumpled receipt, smoothes it out on the steering wheel of the van, and starts to write on it.",

Madison heads out, and as she opens the door, light streams across Jessica's face. The kids glance over at something, and some have stopped to stare. Outside, there's a red curtain set out in the middle of a yard with a crowd gathered around it. Jessica and her friends approach the curtain, it drops, and Robbie stands on a platform behind it.

    "425": "There is a drink in her hand, and a suitcase beside her on the bed. Bert enters her suite and confronts her. Sarah's voice is subdued, controlled. He stands over her, pulling a wad of bills from his pocket. He picks her up and tries to kiss her but she is cold and limp in his arms, so he lets go and she drops back on the bed. Then he turns and walks back into his room. She waits for a moment. Then she takes a cigarette out of a pack, gets up, and goes into his room. In the bathroom mirror, we see Bert asleep on his bed. The sheets are rumpled and tossed about. Then we see Sarah, in her slip, enter the bathroom and shut the door. Eddie is just getting back. He walks through the lobby, ignoring the uniformed policeman standing nearby, and stops at the desk. The concierge stares dumbly. The concierge hands it to him. Eddie walks quickly toward the elevators. He enters, sees the money on Sarah's bed, puts down his cue case, and turns to see a crowd in the adjoining room. Bert, laying in bed, talks to a plainclothesman who stands over him, taking notes. A photographer with a flash camera stands by the bathroom. Bert stops when he sees Eddie through the open door. A uniformed policeman bars Eddie's entrance. Eddie comes in. He looks at the detectives around Bert's bed. The photographer's bulb flashes as he takes a picture of the bathroom. Eddie pushes by the photographer, then stops as he sees Sarah's body laid out on the tiled floor. He drops to his knees beside her. Eddie reaches out to touch her, then pulls back his hand. Bert appears at the bathroom door behind him. Eyes closed, he writhes as he listens to Bert. Suddenly he uncoils and lunges at Bert, grasping him by the throat and pushing him back. A policeman untangles them, but Eddie breaks free. Minnesota Fats sits in his chair, engrossed in the afternoon paper. Big John is at a pool table, trying out a few shots. Bert, in dark glasses, stands near the cashier's cage, chucking dice into a leather shaker. The noise of the dice echoes in the slow, late afternoon gloom of Ames. When Bert sees Eddie push open the glass doors, he draws himself up fearfully like a turtle, and motions with his eyes to his men for protection. Eddie, his cue case tucked under his arm, walks straight toward him. He stops, stares at him for a moment, then turns and walks over to Minnesota Fats. Fats rises, ready to play. Eddie starts to screw his cue together. He turns to join Fats at the table.",
    "328": "Resting on a small rock rising out of the long, overgrown white flowers scattered among well-seeded grasses, an idyllic setting at the end of a long hot summer, the figure is reading a book. The figure in the grass sits up, looking straight at the camera, revealing a handsome young hobbit with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes. This is Frodo Baggins, his eyes alight with excitement. Tossing away the long stem of grass in his mouth, Frodo runs off. A cart rattles along a leafy lane, driven by a stooped figure in grey. The shambling old pony snorts and rears. Shire, 60 years later, camera tracks to a figure lying beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree. Suddenly, Frodo appears on a bank above the cart. They look at each other a moment, then both start laughing as Frodo's face breaks into a smile, and he leaps onto the front seat of the cart. The cart rattles past a field lupin being tended by Gandalf, who looks down at Frodo with a twinkle in his eye. The cart rattles over a stone bridge towards a busy hobbit marketplace. Gandalf surveys the peaceful scene before him. Hobbits look up exclaiming in wonder and excitement as the cart bearing Gandalf and Frodo rolls past the Green Dragon Inn towards the party field, where scores of hobbits are busy preparing for the big night. Odo Proudfoot looks up as the cart passes by, deeply suspicious. As the cart rattles into the small village of Hobbiton, a quaint rustic settlement nestled amongst rolling green hills and large trees, excited children chase after the cart. Gandalf ignores the children's cries, but as they stand deflated, watching Gandalf disappear up the lane, spinning balls of bright color suddenly leap out of the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. Gandalf smiles to himself, well-pleased with his joke, and even Odo Proudfoot is unable to suppress a chuckle. Frodo stands up in the cart as Gandalf reins in the horse. The hobbits live in Hobbit holes: neat burrows dug into the grassy hillside, with round doors and cute front gardens. Gandalf's cart pulls up outside the gate to Bag End, a particularly fine example of a hobbit hole with a large round front door set into a grassy hillside. He raises his staff and raps on the front door, and a voice calls out. Suddenly, the door opens and Bilbo Baggins stands before him, a hobbit of indeterminate age with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Wearing a dashing brocade waistcoat, he looks every inch the eccentric gentleman. Gandalf drops to his knee to embrace his old friend.",
    "864": "In the dark wood, the urchin-like Cosette is carrying a bucket when she sees Valjean approaching. She drops the bucket and runs to hide behind a tree, watching him fearfully as moonlight glows faintly on her young face. Cosette brightens, takes his arm, and he carries the bucket full of water through town, where Madame Thenardier walks up and takes the bucket. Thenardier opens his arms, but Cosette shakes her head at him. Thenardier beckons Cosette to him, but she doesn't go as Madame Thenardier gasps. Valjean grabs back his hat that Thenardier had taken and then takes Cosette, giving her a doll and carrying her away to the inn. Javert rides up and then rides away as Madame Thenardier shoves her husband, who leans in for a kiss, but she pushes him away. Valjean and Cosette ride through the night in a carriage, where she sleeps with her head resting on his lap, and Valjean strokes her hair while the moon shines through trees in the forest. He looks down fondly at the sleeping child, then sees Javert and stuffs the doll inside his coat. They get out of the carriage and run off hand in hand by the city wall as Javert, on horseback, sees them and gives chase. They run along a colonnade, and Valjean climbs over a stone balustrade, lifting Cosette over as Javert is forced to stop and turn back. Valjean pulls down a rope dangling from the side of a building, and now on foot, Javert marches along an alleyway. As Javert searches along dark alleyways, Valjean climbs to the top of a wall, struggling as Cosette watches fearfully. Using the rope, he hauls her up beside him, and they lie still along the top of the wall with Javert below them, who then walks off. Valjean lowers Cosette on the rope on the other side of the wall, climbs down himself, and carries Cosette as they peer into a chapel lit by the golden glow of candlelight, where a group of nuns is singing. Holding Cosette, Valjean turns and sees a man with a spade, who throws down his spade and takes off his hat. They go with Fauchelevant. High up on a tower, Javert stands facing an ornate cross, closes a Bible, and walks out to a ledge overlooking Paris, beside a huge stone eagle, as the tower rises up behind him to a spire with a cross on top. Standing in the corner of the wasteland where the Bastille stood is a giant elephant, a model Napoleon had constructed for a monument, now dowdy and decaying, from which a scruffy, ratty-haired urchin climbs out of a hole in the elephant's head.",
    "1329": "They consider the police car a moment more. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob. Charlie's face lights up when she sees the police car. The door of the police car opens as Charlie races from the diner. The three men see her moving toward the car. Jeep's face goes slack. The men begin to run toward her. While out of the police car steps. Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her, as if she were exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob, Kyle, and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun. A long beat as Michael considers Bob. Michael stares at him blankly. Michael offers up a dangerous smile, revealing a not so well-kept but definitely normal set of teeth. Bob and the others ease slightly. Bob lowers the gun. Michael remains silent. Bob chuckles for a moment. When Michael doesn't respond in kind, Bob falls silent. He slowly raises the shotgun again. Michael sizes up this raggedy group. His gaze drifts over to the loosely wrapped body in front of the diner. The plastic table cloth flaps wildly in the wind. Turning back to Bob. Michael just shakes his head. Michael steps toward Charlie with a sense of purpose, but Bob blocks his path, brandishing the shotgun. That's when Kyle Michael something out in the direction of the road. Michael whips the gun away from Bob's head and thrusts it back into his hands. Bob looks down at the gun, speechless. Michael walks swiftly around to the trunk of the cruiser. Pops it, revealing a staggering arsenal of weaponry. Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep. Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. Boxes of shotgun shells. A flicker of light. And then flashlight beams cut through the darkness, coming to rest on Michael's pale face. Michael looks up at the ceiling. A hatch opens and out comes Michael followed by Bob, Percy, and Kyle. Michael is about to answer, when two headlights appear in the darkness. And sure enough, an ice cream truck rolls slowly toward the diner. It's too dark to see who's behind the wheel. The men quickly do as they're told. Kyle and Bob shoot quick anxious looks at Percy. Charlie and Audrey peer between the slats covering the windows. The ice cream truck's headlights fan across the diner. Audrey and Charlie back away from the windows. Charlie stops next to Jeep. Rests a hand on his arm. Howard smiles weakly at the familiar sound of the calliope. The ice cream truck pulls to a stop with its headlights facing the diner. Everyone aims their guns at the truck.",
    "397": "He turns and sees Dil walking toward him, a bottle in her hand, and he runs toward her. They are tussling in the darkness of the park, and he takes her arm. Fergus and Dil are on the stairs up to Dil's flat, where Fergus looks at her and shakes her, growing alarmed. He slaps her cheek, and she opens her eyes slowly. He walks in holding her, leans her against the wall, and then goes to the window to check the street outside. She takes a large slug from a bottle of whiskey and points weakly to a cabinet through the open door of the bathroom. He goes and gets the pills while she drinks from the whiskey bottle. She walks around the room drinking, then sits down and looks at Fergus. She stares straight ahead, the bottle clutched in her hands between her knees, as Fergus walks slowly toward the door. She looks at him, standing up, with something incredibly attractive about her, and he walks slowly toward her. He kisses her on the lips, and we see the photograph with the soldier's smiling face. She seems to be in a sweet narcotic haze as she reaches out her hand and strokes his. Fergus sits down on the bed as Dil lies back on it, still stroking his hand. Her voice is dreamily slurred, her eyes far away, and she smiles woozily. She woozily tries to hit him round the face and raises an unsteady hand to point at him. He strokes her cheek as she says something very slowly and sleepily, and her eyes close as she falls into a deep sleep. Fergus looks down at her almost fondly as they lie on the bed together, fully clothed. Dil wakes and rises very quietly, going to his coat thrown across a chair. She searches through the pockets and takes out the gun. Meanwhile, Jude is in bed as an alarm sounds, and she reaches to turn it off. Dil takes several silk stockings out of a drawer and ties them very securely to each corner of the brass bed. She ties them round both of Fergus's feet very gently so as not to wake him. Jude, in front of a mirror getting ready, is fully dressed. Dil ties the other stocking and is drawing it upward when Fergus wakes. She jerks the silk stocking so it is secure and speaks unnaturally quietly. Jude takes a gun from under the bed and slips it into her handbag. Dil crouches beside Fergus, his gun in her hand, and Fergus stares at her, trying to pull on the bindings. She stands up, still pointing the gun at Fergus, while Jude is on the street and Maguire's car pulls up rapidly and she gets inside. Fergus drags at his bindings as the figure of the judge appears in the window.",
    "781": "Inside, there's a photo of a couple kissing. Every week contains weddings. He closes the book and stares ahead. At her apartment, Jane is wrestling the evening's dresses into a closet filled to bursting with a colorful riot of party gowns. She squeezes in every last bit of rebellious fabric and pushes backward against the doors, forcing them closed. The doors spring back open. She grabs the papers and settles on the couch. Its glow makes a dark silhouette of the towering city skyline and sunbathes the buildings lining Central Park as rush hour begins. Kevin, carrying coffees, arrives at the offices of the New York Journal. Crossing a street, Jane meets Casey getting out of a cab. Casey proudly sports a man's white shirt. They walk into their office reception. Jane grins and heads for her cluttered desk. He shows her the filofax. She glares at him. Jane is with Casey looking at photo layouts. As Gina walks off, Jane looks exasperated. Casey pulls a face. Jane looks pained as ruggedly handsome George walks off. Casey stalks off, leaving Jane sorting out some unruly adhesive notes. Casey flashes Gina a false smile. Casey flounces off. A jumbo jet touches down, and in the airport, Jane smiles as cute blonde Tess arrives. The sisters arrive at Jane's apartment. Jane struggles with the luggage. At night, in one of thousands of taxis, Kevin reads Jane's filofax. Jane and Casey are at Gina's party in a busy, low-lit club. George saunters suavely over to them. Jane walks breathlessly over to where George is drinking beer and chatting with friends. Tess, in a shimmery dress, approaches from the other direction. George spots her and grins, then clocks Jane. As Jane approaches, her face falls, realizing that George and Tess are making a beeline for each other. They smile as Jane frowns. Jane fakes a smile as George catches her eye. As Tess and George leave, Kevin walks up. She looks stunned. She hands him her drink, then turns and walks out of the club through a side door. Kevin looks puzzled as she bashes a wall with her handbag. She's in full view of a sedate dinner party. Trying to regain her composure, she rejoins Kevin in the club, who's waiting, eyebrows raised. She stares after Tess and George. Later, a car drives past Jane's building. She rushes to the front door, peers through the peephole, then flings it open. She stomps back inside. Jane switches on the light in the living room, it's empty and she wanders anxiously up and down, then picks up a magazine from the couch, sits in a chair, thumbs through it distractedly. She glances towards the front door.",
    "40": "TEX takes the list, examines it, then folds it and puts it in his pocket. They finish with the items from the bag. She hangs up and turns to JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE looks to where JEAN-LOUIS is pointing -- to the top of the high armoire. Taking one of the straight chairs to the armoire, she stands on it. Although she is still not high enough to see anything, by standing on tip-toes she is able to reach with her hand over the top and grope around blindly. REGGIE has finally managed to pull down the case -- a rectangular black bag about the size and shape of a trombone case. As he climbs off the chair, JEAN-LOUIS suddenly runs to the door, unbolts it and runs into the hall, CAMERA PANNING with him. As JEAN-LOUIS runs out into the hall, shouting, DYLE is the first one to appear, coming out of GIDEON's room. TEX has also appeared from REGGIE's room, followed by GIDEON. The THREE MEN rush by JEAN-LOUIS and squeeze simultaneously into SCOBIE's room. As DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON enter, REGGIE is placing the little straight black chair to its original position. As they stare at the case, surprised and just a little embarrassed, slowly TEX lowers the lid. The MEN avoid looking at one another, including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door. The MEN look at one another. The THREE MEN hurry past REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS and out of the door. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, followed by REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS cross the hall to DYLE's room. DYLE turns the key which is still in the door. He enters, followed by the others. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON stand in the center of the room, looking around. REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS wait in the open doorway. The room looks like a cyclone hit the place, but there is no sign of SCOBIE. The sound of running water can be heard coming from behind the closed door to the bathroom and DYLE is the first to notice the water beginning to leak out from under the door. SCOBIE, still dressed in his raincoat, lies face up, his head submerged in the filled tub, the water now pouring over the edge. His face is distorted. DYLE's hand appears and turns off the water. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON staring at CAMERA. CLOSE SHOT -- SCOBIE. CAMERA WHIRLS for a TIGHT CLOSE SHOT of a MAID, her eyes widening as the realization that the man is dead strikes her. Then she screams. CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. GRANDPIERRE raps for silence on his desk. During the pause, he looks into each face in turn. REGGIE and DYLE walking along the quai, next to the Seine. They have passed an ice-cream wagon on the corner of the Pont au Double.",
    "584": "Trina tumbles across the galley as the plane straightens out and the gauges drop. They head towards a church on an expanse of open land, and Whip steers the plane away from the church's steeple, but the wing grazes the top. The plane hits the ground, and debris glides past the cockpit as Whip bangs his head and passes out. Through blurred vision, Whip sees Ken leaning to the side in his seat as he is dragged out, while Margaret is slumped next to Trina's still body, her head crushed by a collapsed bulkhead. Smoke blocks Whip's vision as he is pulled away from the plane, with people in white robes helping the passengers. A fire engine arrives, and Whip looks up at a female EMT leaning over him, then turns towards the black smoke rising from the crash site. The broken-off spire from the church lies some distance away from an ambulance as rescue workers help survivors. In a hospital ward, Whip slowly opens his right eye, the other covered by a bandage, and sees a seated man on the TV gesturing as rescue workers push a stretcher behind him. A Channel 12 News field reporter comments live from the site as lights flicker in the background, and cell phone footage on TV shows the descent of the plane swerving and slicing off the church steeple, gliding overhead with both engines on fire, and slamming down on its side as people in white robes run for cover. Whip, his head wrapped in gauze, watches in a daze as the church folks stand and take in the scene from a distance, then slowly approach. Whip averts his gaze from the screen and notices a man in the room wearing a suit with the collar open, staring intently at his cell phone. Charlie turns and Whip smiles as a man in an NTSB jacket enters, followed by law officers, a nurse, and a doctor. The NTSB officer places a recorder on Whip's bed, and Whip nods weakly as the doctor leaves. Craig takes his recorder and leaves with the others, but Charlie stays back, smiles, reaches for a plastic bag, and then leaves. Whip puts his bandaged hand to his mouth as tears flow down his face, shakes his head, takes his cell phone from the plastic bag, and drops it on his stomach. A heavy man with a goatee enters the hospital, wearing Bermuda shorts and dark glasses with earphone wires hanging on each side of his head. He strides to the corridors carrying a bag in his hand and another slung over his shoulder, removes his earphones, and leans over the reception desk.",
    "469": "Joseph places the chain around his neck as the crowd claps. Salieri attempts to kiss Joseph's hand, but Joseph restrains him and moves on. Cavalieri smiles adoringly, gives Joseph a deep curtsey, and he raises her up. The crowd flocks to Salieri with cries and words of approval, all wanting to shake his hand, tugging and patting him. Salieri pays attention to only one man, looking around until he finds Mozart standing there. Eagerly, Salieri moves towards him, smiling. Later, there is explosive laughter as Mozart and Schikaneder enter an apartment with three actresses, looking pleased with themselves. The front door opens gingerly, and a still rather drunk Mozart sticks his head into the room, anxious not to make a noise. He sees strangers and smiles, then opens the door wide to admit Schikaneder and the girls. Mozart stares. On stage, the huge figure of the Commendatore, in robes and helmet, is seen extending his arms and pointing in accusation. A huge nailed fist crashes through a painted dining room wall on stage. The giant armored statue of the Commendatore enters, pointing his finger in accusation at Don Giovanni, who sits at the supper table, while his servant Leporello quakes with fear under the table. Salieri is standing alone in the back of a box in semi-darkness, unseen. The theatre is only half full as the scene on stage continues with the Commendatore addressing Giovanni. Don Giovanni is seized by the Statue's icy hand, and flames burst from obviously artificial rocks as demons appear, dragging him down to Hell. Salieri stares wide-eyed. Schikaneder sits at a table, drinking from a bottle of wine, and Michael Schlumberg enters from his salon. Mozart stands looking very unwell and bewildered, staring in panic, and suddenly springs up, clearly terrified, running out of the room into his workroom and shutting the door. Constanze, now a little scared, goes to the front door and opens it cautiously. Schikaneder, floridly dressed as usual, is standing there, while Lorl peeks out from the kitchen. Schikaneder sees the manuscript on the table and eagerly goes to it, picking up a page without waiting for a reply. Mozart opens the workroom door, appearing wild-eyed, extremely pale, and strange as Schikaneder sees him. Mozart giggles triumphantly, while Schikaneder stares at him. Mozart, with a bright and rather demented smile, presents his head to Schikaneder, who suddenly grabs Mozart's lapels. Lorl, frightened and tearful, sits before Salieri.",
    "1241": "The clock shows five past four. Pacing now, with his hands clasped together behind his head, a cigarette dangling between his lips, Brian looks alternately at his office floor, then at the clock. He looks up, awestruck, as silhouettes of fans leaping to their feet in celebration crowd the frosted windows. The clock ticks half-four. Brian sits with his head in his hands. He stands and once more peers up at the figures of the cheering Derby fans. He bows his head against the wall, then paces in the light streaming through the windows, his hands on his head. Brian puts on his jacket, straightens his tie and steps into the corridor. Outside his office door, he smooths both hands over his hair, then strides off down the gloomy, brick-walled passage. He stops in his tracks as he sees Jimmy and Peter turn the corner ahead. Jimmy strolls off, leaving Peter frowning at Brian. Peter's face softens into a grin. Beaming, Brian runs and embraces him. The team cheer in the dressing room. A Telex machine. Match footage. Brian in TV interview. Parkinson grins. Derby climb the table to the top. In interview again. Crowds welcome the Derby team bus back with the cup. Muhammad Ali on TV. Crowds flock down the mile to Wembley for the charity shield. Color TV footage from the time. Jimmy follows Brian into the Leeds dressing room. Brian takes a note from his blazer pocket. The team turn grudgingly. He grins and winks. Bremner shoots a dour glance at Giles. The teams come out. Bremner scratches his balls as he eyes Brown contemptuously, standing beside the team lined up for the national anthem. Don sings in the stands. On the pitch, Brian remains tight-lipped. Brian smirks wryly as he locks looks with Don, who looks away imperiously. Bremner salutes Don in the stands, who smiles back and touches his nose smugly. The Leeds team jig in a circle on the spot with their right arms raised to the fans. Liverpool on the edge of the Leeds area. Off the ball, Giles punches Keegan to the floor. Brian shuts his eyes. Commentators watch as Brian mutters furiously. Emlyn Hughes lifts the shield. Brian's patted consolingly on the shoulder. At an FA tribunal. The row of gray-haired men in blazers rise. Bremner trudges out after the officials, leaving Brian sitting alone, brooding. Brian's on the phone in his hotel suite. Peter listens. Brian swigs booze. Peter's eyes rove in anguish as his brows knit in a frown. He hangs up. Brian is left hunched over on his hotel bed, head in hand. By the dressing rooms. Brian nods sagely, then leans close.

    "1052": "Lizzie and the Gardiners are traveling through the rolling hills of the Peaks. Darcy is practicing his fencing. They shake hands and Baines leaves. Lizzie is picking her way across the rocks at the top of a hill, while the Gardiners are watching her from the bottom of the slope. Lizzie gazes at the countryside around her. That evening, the three of them are eating supper. Mrs. Gardiner looks at Lizzie, and Lizzie smiles. The next day, the open-topped carriage is making its way through the green countryside, towards Pemberley. It crosses a tiny, single-arched bridge over a stream. Lizzie and Mrs. Gardiner sit facing Mr. Gardiner. The carriage continues on its way, passing through woods in the bright sunshine. Then, the magnificent Pemberley appears, and Lizzie's breath is taken away by the sheer splendor of the classical, stately home. Lizzie nods with a broad smile. The carriage rolls beneath a grand, ornate arch leading to Pemberley. Inside, the housekeeper shows them a beautiful mahogany writing desk. They continue on, into the next room. The housekeeper turns to Lizzie, who walks over to the window and looks out at the lake, mirror-like, at the foot of the lawn. A portrait of Georgiana is seated and looking pensive, and there is a miniature portrait of a rather haughty young man. They head up a grand, white staircase. Outside, a white horse is cantering along a wooden path, with Darcy astride it, dressed elegantly in a top hat and frock coat. Bringing the horse to a halt, he stares from the hilltop, over at Pemberley, which can just be glimpsed through the trees. He breathes deeply, as if trying to come to a decision. Then suddenly, he sets the horse in motion again and gallops onward. Near a lake, he stops and quickly dismounts. He takes off his top hat and starts to undo his coat. Inside, the tour of Pemberley continues, and the housekeeper leads them into a magnificent long hall, lined with paintings on one side and windows on the other. She stops in front of one of the paintings, and Lizzie gazes up at the portrait of Darcy, staring proudly out at them. Outside, Darcy has now taken off his frock coat, lays it on the grass, sits on it, and undoes his cravat. His dark hair curls with sweat. Then he unbuttons his waistcoat and slips it off. Inside, Lizzie is still gazing up at his portrait. Darcy stands at the very edge of the lake, now in just his breeches and loose, white shirt. Steeling himself, he dives in, plunges down into the murky, green waters, then begins to swim with long, effortless strokes. Lizzie is now admiring the formal gardens.",
    "71": "A SMOKER steps in, and Dante manages to break his study of the O.C. oddity and searches for the smokes. The smoker glances at Randal and then at the O.C. oddity. The smoker looks at Randal. The odd man places a handkerchief over an egg on the floor and quickly whisks the handkerchief away to reveal the egg still sitting on the floor. Dante, Randal, and the smoker stare at the O.C. man. Then, a little girl comes into view, smiling and holding money. She can't be any more than five. A female customer pops items onto the counter and stands silently, awaiting something. Dante rings her up. Randal flips open the magazine's centerfold, revealing a graphic picture of a woman with her vaginal lips and anus spread wide open. Dante frantically apologizes to the rapidly exiting customer. Randal checks out the centerfold wistfully. A woman pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the cooler for the perfect container of milk. A series of people address the camera, asking dumb questions, while others stand in various locations throughout the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions. Dante gives Randal a shove to shut him up. Veronica enters the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum foil, and Dante is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under her arm. Randal makes loud slurping noises from O.C. and walks past the two, patting Veronica on the head as he exits. She exits too. Randal is recommending titles to potential customers and pops his head in to make the loud slurping noise again before hanging up. Randal joins Dante, then walks away, causing Dante to shake his head in frustration and pick up the phone again, rolling his eyes to the ceiling. Randal comes back. Tape is rolled around the top of a stick; an orange ball is slapped back and forth by a blade, and laces are pulled tightly. Randal enters, wearing his equipment as the hockey players fill the convenience store. Sanford skates up and skids to a halt, and on the roof, they jump off the ladder and skate around. From across the street, we get the full, odd perspective of a store with many men gliding around on the roof. Some sit on the floor or lean against the coolers, but all are either preparing or practicing. On the roof, Dante skates and passes with another player, while the players ascend a ladder adjacent to the door, one by one. Randal pulls his mask on and slaps his glove, urging a shot. Sanford skates in and takes a shot, which Randal blocks. Jay and Silent Bob deal to a player: he drops money over the ledge, and Jay throws up a dime bag.",

At her home, Charlotte shouts up the stairs, and Skeeter bursts excitedly through her door in her pajamas, almost slipping on the stairs. She opens the fly screen door of the kitchen and looks about her expectantly, with her hair in rollers. Skeeter stares at her smooth hair, and Charlotte watches her drive off in a pickup truck with a loaded trailer on the back. She speeds across a bridge towards a leafy suburb. At the Holbrooks', Hilly is checking her watch as Skeeter arrives looking disheveled. William and Stuart get to their feet, and the men swig their Coke humorously. At dinner, clean-cut pursuited Stuart downs his glass of bourbon and points imperiously at a waiter, looking perplexed. Hilly ushers her husband away from the table, leaving Skeeter alone with Stuart, who burps, and Skeeter rolls her eyes. Skeeter leaves the table and barges out, much to bourbon-drinking Stuart's amusement, as he winks tipsily at William, who shakes his head despairingly. In her yard, Celia brings a flapping chicken to a log where an ax is waiting to dispatch the bird, while Minnie, watching from a window, winces. A tin of Crisco lard is set aside as Celia smiles warmly. Minnie folds down the top of a brown paper bag and hands it to Celia. Later, Minnie sits down at a prettily laid table by a window in the kitchen to have her lunch, puts a napkin on her lap, and brings a fried chicken wing to her lips. Minnie gapes at Celia's determined expression and sits back down as Celia bites into a chicken leg and smiles contentedly. Minnie gives her a look. Minnie and Aibileen have been listening to the phone conversation in Aibileen's dimly lit house, and she brushes Minnie's hand away. Her face crumples with the pain of the recollection, and she gets up from the table and leaves the room. By the Holbrook swimming pool, Hilly is addressing the local ladies, and Elizabeth simpers. Elain spots the pamphlet peeking out of Skeeter's briefcase, theatrically shielding her eyes from the sun, and waits for Aibileen's reply. Aibileen looks across at Yule Mae, and their eyes meet. Later, Skeeter wanders into the Holbrook's kitchen and finds Yule Mae by the sink, who checks nobody is in near shot. Hilly comes in, carrying her little boy Billy, kisses Billy on the head, and hands him over to Yule Mae. Hilly's face hardens, her lip curling unpleasantly as she points a menacing finger. After dark, Skeeter is working in her room, puffing on a cigarette as she considers Hilly's text, and looks up at a shelf above her, gazing bitterly at a photograph of herself and Hilly when they were younger.",
    "107": "A police officer escorts Jenny to her grandmother's trailer, where Jenny's grandmother meets her outside and leads her toward the trailer. Jenny later climbs over a second-floor railing and enters the house, lying in bed next to young Forrest and hugging him. As teenagers, Forrest and Jenny walk along an oak-lined road until Forrest is suddenly hit in the back with a rock. They turn around to see a teenage boy throwing another rock, just as a pickup truck pulls up. Jenny turns and looks at Forrest, who drops his books and runs down the road. The teenage boy jumps into the back of the pickup truck with another boy as the truck speeds after Forrest, and Jenny steps left to get out of the way. Forrest leaps over a five-foot fence as the boys try to catch him and looks left while continuing to tell his life story. He runs along the road in front of the high school as the truck chases him and the boys pound on the roof. Forrest runs under the field goal post and through the end zone. The crowd roars with excitement as a football is kicked off and players run around the field. Forrest is seen in a University of Alabama football uniform, looking up into the cheering crowd as his teammate fields the kickoff and hands him the ball. The football coach, assistants, and Alabama players cheer for Forrest as he runs across the field, speeds past defending and opposing players. The football coach runs along the sidelines yelling, while Forrest cuts toward the sidelines, and two opposing players collide. The football coach, assistants, and players motion for Forrest to run toward the end zone. Forrest turns up the sidelines and runs toward the end zone as some opposing players fall down, trying to catch him. He runs into the end zone as an opposing player dives at his feet, and the referee signals a touchdown as the crowd cheers wildly. Forrest continues to run, smashing through band members, and makes his way toward the team tunnel. The football coach looks at an assistant coach as an anchorman named Chet Huntley appears on television. Forrest walks through a crowd of people and steps over to a young man as the crowd observes the demonstration. Forrest walks toward the schoolhouse as a football coach looks at a black and white television, where a newsman outside the schoolhouse speaks to the camera. The footage then cuts to Governor Wallace speaking to General Graham.",
    "1039": "Sam spots the elevator stuck on the seventh floor, while elsewhere, a sweaty Javier glares at Veronica then lowers the gun, only to raise it again as Veronica relaxes. Veronica shakes her head, and Javier relents, leaving her in the elevator and touching his stomach in the corridor, bringing his palm away bloody. Javier, dressed in a Spanish policeman's uniform, heads down the stairwell in the hotel. Outside, Sam sees Veronica leaving the elevator with a covered gurney, and rushes to help, wheeling it while Veronica tends the drip. The President is covered by a blue blanket. Javier leaves the annex and on the street checks his watch. Sam and Veronica wheel the President's gurney over to the ambulance as Luis runs up to them, climbs in, and Sam shuts the door. The ambulance pulls away from the chaos outside the hotel. In a speeding hatchback, Barnes answers his cell phone, shifts gear, and moves through traffic in the narrow street. On a different street, Sam weaves through traffic in the ambulance, and inside, Ashton, lying under the blanket, opens his eyes, lowers a sidebar, and, as the ambulance rounds a corner, falls to the floor. Taylor speeds along in a Spanish police car while Veronica smiles at Sam in the driver's seat. Then Enrique runs across the road in front of them and exchanges a stunned glance with Veronica. Sam looks shiftily across at Veronica as Veronica shoots Luis point blank while Ashton cowers on the floor by the gurney, then reaches out for the drip support, disconnects the metal bar, and holds it against his chest. Meanwhile, Javier approaches a couple getting into their car and pulls his gun, and a middle-aged man nervously offers his keys as Taylor drives down the street towards Javier, stopping as Javier slaps the bonnet of the Spanish police car. Barnes suddenly breaks, backs up, and spots Javier climbing into Taylor's police car, setting off in pursuit as Barnes wears a focused expression, drifting around corners and weaving through traffic right behind them, pulling out his cell phone. A taxi plows into the side of Barnes's hatchback, sending his small blue car into a spin along the road behind Taylor, but Barnes rights the vehicle with a determined frown. Taylor looks back as Barnes throws his car into gear and accelerates after Taylor, who power-slides around a corner with Barnes in hot pursuit. Taylor gets on the radio, while Sam glances anxiously across at Veronica who holds onto her seat belt. Barnes races past pavements full of panicking pedestrians, dodging traffic, as Javier fidgets anxiously in the police car's passenger seat. Policemen frantically direct scared members of the public away from the chase as both cars head through a junction.",

She tilts her head, glances at Sandy, kisses the back of his neck, and rubs his shoulder as she lies down behind him. Now, Sandy walks into the living room and sees his two young daughters sleeping on the couch. Diana sleeps on the floor beside the girls and holds Frannie's hand. The young father stands over the trio and flips off a table lamp. As he slowly leaves, our view moves down to Diana and Frannie's joined hands. Later, Sandy awakens and looks at the clock, buries his face in his pillow, opens his bedroom door, and goes down the hall. He discovers Frannie and Jessie decked out in Diana-style gaudy makeup. He looks around the corner, then back to his girls. Jessie gets up, retrieves a note, and hands him a folded slip of pink paper. Sandy unfolds the note and walks past men and women in suits, nodding curtly as he passes the receptionist desk. Giving someone else a weak wave, Sandy heads to his office and pauses and looks at his name placard on the glass door. He passes it and joins a conference-room meeting already in progress, where Daniel looks up and points behind Sandy. He turns and sees Diana through the walls of an all-glass office. Sandy takes a step and peers intently at the conversation. Diana sits across from the detective, while two officers stand and watch her. Sandy goes over, opens the door, and nods stiffly. The cops leave, Sandy shoots Diana a wide-eyed stare, and Diana leaves in handcuffs and her flowing black dress. The police escort her away, and Sandy comes out of the office. He watches the repentant woman as she turns and gives a teary smile. An officer holds her arm and leads her off. Sandy goes to Daniel, who walks off, leaving Sandy standing alone. Fade to black. Now, Trish carries a cake across the yard to a table where Sandy cradles their newborn. He checks his watch. Now, in a prison's visiting yard, she holds up an exam with an A-plus grade. She gives Franny a big hug, then reaches out for Jessie. Diana pulls a document out of a large, yellow envelope and inspects it, pats the birth certificate, then slides it over to Sandy. Diana rises from the picnic table and passes behind him, then abruptly turns and embraces him. He looks at her and smiles. Sandy gathers up the envelope and stands, glancing at the paperwork in his hands.",
    "341": "LEGOLAS fires an arrow at the KING OF THE DEAD, but it passes straight through, while ARAGORN keeps moving forward, his eyes locked on the spectre. The KING OF THE DEAD snarls and raises his deadly sword above ARAGORN'S head, sweeping it towards him with a terrifying shriek in slow motion as ARAGORN raises his sword in answer. There is a low whistle as it sweeps through the air, followed by a clang as the blade of Anduril clashes with the spectral sword, the sharp ring of metal reverberating through the caverns. The KING OF THE DEAD stares at ARAGORN in disbelief as ARAGORN grabs the shocked ghost by the neck and holds the sharp blade against the ghost's throat before releasing him. Ghostly faces stare hollow-eyed at ARAGORN as thousands of ORCS continue moving relentlessly forward towards the walls of MINAS TIRITH. A GUARD yells down from the parapet as the huge gate swings open, revealing FARAMIR'S badly wounded horse dragging FARAMIR behind; both are impaled with orc arrows. IORLAS and other soldiers arrive at the citadel with FARAMIR'S unconscious body on a stretcher, followed by PIPPIN. DENETHOR emerges from the tower hall towards his son and bends to the stretcher bearing his son, with PIPPIN devastated. GOTHMOG turns to his lieutenants, and at his orders, the great catapults fire. The orc catapults do not fire rocks, causing horror to sweep through the streets of MINAS TIRITH as the severed heads of FARAMIR'S horsemen land among the soldiers. DENETHOR looks down at FARAMIR'S unconscious body as PIPPIN bends towards him, and DENETHOR slowly turns away, reaching the edge of the courtyard and staring in shocked disbelief at the vista spread out below. From a high wide angle, 75,000 orcs are seen spread out across the PELENNOR FIELDS like a sea of black ants as trolls load the catapults with rocks, and battering rams and siege towers are hauled on chains. Thousands of flickering torches give the army the look of a moving city in the murky Mordor twilight as DENETHOR struggles to regain the power of speech. A huge boulder smashes into the wall of MINAS as boulders hurtle from catapults across the fields towards MINAS TIRITH, smashing into a balcony full of civilians, spreading confusion and panic among the soldiers. GANDALF'S staff smashes into the back of DENETHOR'S head as GANDALF grimly swings his staff again, clubbing DENETHOR to the ground, then GANDALF spins around and addresses the soldiers. GANDALF gallops down the winding labyrinthine streets on SHADOWFAX against the flow of fleeing soldiers and bounds up stairs onto the level one battlements.",
    "1103": "As she goes upstairs, the group of boys follows her. Walt goes over to Thao and sips his drink as Thao looks away. Walt matches off, leaving Thao looking dejected but thoughtful. Walt mows his front lawn with a push mower, and he looks up to see two of his Hmong neighbors bringing flowers to his house. The neighbors smile, and as they leave the flowers, Walt carries on mowing. He stops and looks back at them. Later, he opens his door to more neighbors bearing food, sniffs it, and waves the three women and their food inside, following them in. Later, he pulls onto his drive in his pickup and finds Sue, Thao, and their mother waiting for him; he shoos them away. He's on his porch drinking coffee and stands up as a sheepish-looking Thao approaches. Walt leaves him to it and wanders off towards his garage. Thao finds Walt watching his abatis border and looks thoughtful, then shrugs. Walt looks at a very dilapidated house across the street. Thao is up a ladder, fixing the old house, as Walt watches with a Hmong neighbor. Thao removes a louvered shutter from the roof, pulls up a dead tree in the garden, and loads rubble into a wheelbarrow. Walt, chewing tobacco, stands across the street with Daisy and watches as Thao fixes the house number onto a post on the porch. Walt smokes a cigarette and watches Thao scrape old paint off the clapboard exterior before giving it a coat of fresh paint. It's raining hard, and Walt stands on his porch watching Thao struggle with an old tree stump in the garden opposite as Walt smokes another cigarette. Thao digs the stump out in the rain, and exhausted, he sits down by the stump. An elder Hmong man and a young girl approach Walt as he sits on his front steps, and then they go. Smiling, Walt turns to Daisy, as a grinning Thao, rubbing his blistered hands together, walks up Walt's front steps. Walt is in his bathroom, spits blood into the sink, regards himself in the mirror for a moment, and then goes to the door as he considers. Thao's smile fades when he turns to go, but he turns back, and Walt's face softens a bit. Walt disappears inside and shuts the door, and Thao wanders down off the porch. Walt sits in a doctor's waiting room, glancing around at the other patients. An Indian woman sits beside him, and an Indian man and a black woman sit opposite him. A Muslim nurse appears wearing a headscarf, and Walt frowns. Irritated, Walt gets up as a female Oriental doctor checks his notes.",

Concerned, Ryan frowns. She nods stiffly. An American Airlines jet taxis. The silver jet with red, white, and blue liveries speeds along the runway and takes off. Rows of houses in suburbia. Kansas City. Ryan and Natalie walk into a large open-plan office which has already been cleared, apart from a few chairs and a couple of desks. The receptionist looks up at Natalie and Ryan tearfully. Natalie scans the bare office, looking slightly uncomfortable. Another flight. Tulsa. In a hotel lobby, Ryan stands waiting as Natalie talks on her phone. Ryan frowns and turns sharply to look in a mirror. Ryan and Natalie sit in separate offices with various employees who look at their strategy packets. Outside a hotel room with Alex, Ryan tries one of his cards in the door slot. It doesn't work, so he tosses it away. He tries another and opens the door. They go in. A jet takes off. On the flight, Ryan hands Natalie an American Airlines Priority Access application form and a pen. She tentatively takes them. A wide river runs through a city. Ryan and Natalie meet several employees. An old guy lets out a short breath. Ryan finds Natalie sitting in a room crammed full of office chairs. She gets up, holding her coat. They walk out past a car rental office. A few, small clouds float in the clear sky above Miami, set against the deep, blue ocean. A jet comes in to land. Ryan gives a motivational talk. Natalie stands at the back of the conference room, watching. He smiles thoughtfully. In a corridor, Ryan chats with a couple of delegates. Natalie looks up from her cell phone, shocked. Natalie looks over at Ryan. They sit facing each other on the Hilton shuttle bus.",
    "995": "Tom sees her as Gatsby approaches, causing Tom to panic. Tom throws money at Wilson and speeds off after Gatsby and Daisy, who are now ahead. Watching from the upstairs window, Myrtle looks desperate and tearful. Gatsby and Tom drive along the filthy road past heaps of trash and coal waste, heading across the Queensboro Bridge side-by-side. Gatsby looks at Tom to his left, puts his foot down, and the coupe edges ahead. Grinning, Daisy waves exuberantly as they pass a train and head into New York City. In a plush suite at the Plaza Hotel, Tom watches an employee chip away at a large block of ice with an ice pick, while windows are wide open and several fans are on. The others sit around drinking whiskey, and the ice is put on a tray. Sweat glows on their faces, and Tom presses ice against the back of his neck. Nick and Jordan pay close attention to their exchange as frowning, Gatsby nods at Tom and stands across the room from him. Nick glances about uncomfortably while Gatsby has a sip of whiskey and goes to stand at a window. Gatsby turns to face Tom who stands with his back to Gatsby, while Gatsby takes Daisy's hand. Silently seething, Tom turns to face Gatsby as Daisy slowly sits and Tom glowers. Daisy is tearful, shakes her head, and Tom looks unnerved as tears fill her eyes and her head droops forward. Gatsby smiles inquiringly, Tom points at Nick, and Gatsby drinks. Gatsby holds Tom by his shirt collar and looms over him with his fist raised. Tom rests his forehead against Gatsby's for a moment, then grins as if he's won some kind of game. Daisy holds her hands over her face fearfully, as does Jordan. Gatsby looks shocked, and his chest heaving, steps away from Tom. Daisy stares at Gatsby, tears brimming in her eyes, as he goes to her and tears flood from her eyes. Tom looks at his watch as Gatsby runs out, knocking over a lamp, and Tom pushes the door shut, causing the phone book to fall to the floor. He has a slug of whiskey, and frowning heavily, Nick goes to look out of a window as Tom unwraps another bottle of whiskey. Nick remains at the window, turns, and Tom glances away while Nick looks out of the window, across the Queensboro Bridge. Myrtle's forehead is cut as Wilson shakes the poles around her neck, and she hits him and runs. The bright yellow Deusenberg thunders through the Valley of Ashes, and seeing the car, Myrtle runs into the road. As another car approaches, Gatsby grips the wheel of the Deusenberg to try and swerve, but it's too late, and the Deusenberg hits Myrtle. She rolls up the bonnet, hits the windscreen, and is thrown in the air.",
    "1291": "The Previa cruises slowly into the Loring's fancy gated community, where Mark and Vanessa Loring have an impressive, though generic McMansion. The entire yard is unlandscaped soil, and Mac pulls over and parks on the curb. Both look mortified as they wait for someone to greet them, until Vanessa, a pretty, meticulous woman in her early thirties, opens the door and awkwardly leads them into her home. Juno takes off her hooded sweatshirt and thrusts it into Vanessa's arms, who sets it on a bench. Mark Loring, a boyishly attractive guy in his mid-thirties, appears next to Vanessa and glances sheepishly at her upon hearing the Penny Saver mention, then extends his hand to Mac and Juno. Mac seizes Mark's hand and pumps it heartily. Mark and Vanessa usher Juno and Mac into the austere, spacious living room, where a woman in a business suit sits on the couch with a briefcase in her lap. Vanessa is clearly ecstatic as Mark and Juno lock eyes, and Juno holds her wrist up to Mark's twitching nostrils, which he inhales. Juno is staring into a room with the door slightly ajar, revealing guitars mounted on the wall and the edges of posters. Meanwhile, Vanessa, Mac, and Gerta Rauss are waiting in awkward silence for Juno and Mark to return, and Mac notices a brand new Pilates machine sitting in its packaging in a corner of the room. Vanessa and Gerta have no response, and Vanessa looks to the ceiling, while Mark and Juno tool around on the guitars unplugged, playing little riffs. Mark seems visibly embarrassed by Vanessa's manic demeanor. Juno and Mac have put their coats on and are in the process of leaving, with Vanessa and Mark trailing behind as Mac stares at Juno gravely. Juno looks at Mark, and then she and Mac exit, with Mark shutting the door. The track team jogs in formation, leaving tracks in the snow, while Bleeker runs alone on the track. Bleeker's friend Vijay, a solemn, skinny boy much like Bleeker, jogs up alongside him, commenting that those bastards never stop running before jogging off. Bleeker stops and wipes away his sweat. We're then looking over Juno's now five-month pregnant belly to a school administrator filling out a slip, which Juno takes and turns around smiling all the way out. Juno exits the head office and bumps into Bleeker. Later, the monitor reveals the baby's head, and Juno, Leah, and Bren become immediately defensive, with Bren gesturing to the ultrasound monitor before the ultrasound tech exits in a huff. Juno lays in bed checking out the ultrasound printout. The Previa drives into the front gate of Mark and Vanessa's exclusive community, and Juno rings the doorbell, shifting her weight in the cold, until Mark, dressed in a t-shirt and jeans, answers the door.",
    "190": "Loomis makes it to the front porch and tentatively steps up to the door. He glances back to his friends in the street. The boy turns to open the door, then Loomis' POV moves back to Lonnie at the front door. He's scared out of his mind. Lonnie spins around and stares in horror at the talking hedge. Moving like the wind, Lonnie barrels off the porch and races back to his friends. The boys hurtle off down the street in utter terror. Loomis quietly stands up behind the hedge. He watches them race away, smiling to himself. Suddenly, two hands enter frame and grab Loomis' shoulders. Loomis jumps and spins around. Standing there is Brackett. Brackett turns and walks back to the street. A car pulls up in front of the house and parks. Its lights flick off. The sounds of laughter come from inside. Bob Simms, a good-looking 17-year-old, pops open a can of beer. Next to him, Lynda guzzles hers. The lights are all out. Bob opens the door and together they fall out onto the ground. The can of beer falls over onto the front seat. They embrace. Bob grabs Lynda and she starts giggling. Bob picks Lynda up and carries her up to the front door. Lynda squirms in Bob's arms. As he sets her down, her foot accidentally hits the front door and it swings open. Lynda and Bob both stop. Bob and Lynda enter the house. The living room is empty. The lights are off. Lynda and Bob enter the house and begin turning on the lights. Bob walks over to Lynda. They embrace. They kiss. Bob pulls Lynda over to the couch and turns out the light. A shadow comes over them. They continue kissing, unaware of the shape of a man on the stairway watching. The house is totally black inside. Then an orange light floats around the room. As it gets closer, we see that Laurie is carrying a Jack-O-Lantern, with a candle illuminating from the center of the pumpkin. Behind Laurie are Lyndsey and Tommy making scary noises. The procession continues through the house. The procession continues to the front window. Laurie places the Jack-O-Lantern on the window sill. She looks down the street toward the Wallaces. Laurie sees Bob's car parked in front of the house. Laurie sits down on the couch and sighs. Lindsey and Tommy cuddle up with her, one on either side. Laurie gets up to answer it. Lynda hangs up the phone and grins. Bob grins. Lynda grabs Bob's hand and stands up. Lynda pulls Bob up from the couch and they walk quickly up the stairs. She walks to the window and glances out.",
    "1280": "A screen shows the mass spreading out across the Eastern seaboard of the United States. New York City is completely deserted. The lights and advertisements of Times Square have no one to see them. Mike's SUV drives down the empty streets. Mike drives with Klaatu in the passenger seat, while in the back, Helen and Jacob look anxiously at each other. Mike glances at Klaatu then accelerates. They hurtle towards the military roadblock, and soldiers dive out of the way. They are pursued by hummers with machine guns. Mike looks tense, and Helen looks nervously out of the back window, while Klaatu seems calm. The pursuers fall back as they turn into leafy, wooded Central Park and drive across the grass towards the sphere. An explosion lifts the car, rolling it over several times before it comes to rest against the tree. Fighters streak overhead as the sphere is engulfed in a great fireball. Regina watches the attack on a monitor and closes her eyes in relief. As the smoke clears, the sphere is completely intact. Meanwhile, the swarm reaches the edge of Manhattan. In the car, Mike is dead. Helen frantically undoes her seat belt, looks at Mike, and notices the windscreen is being eaten. Klaatu pulls himself out of the car, then lifts out Jacob. Helen emerges and looks up to see the swarm swirling around the sphere as more gray clouds of bugs arrive, darkening the skies. Klaatu looks around, then grabbing Jacob's hand, he leads them in a sprint across the grass. Just ahead of the hedge, they run into a tunnel and the swarm stays outside. Klaatu frowns, thinking hard. Jacob's nose is bleeding. As Helen crouches to examine him, he collapses in her arms. She wipes her nose and finds blood on her finger. She looks at Klaatu pleadingly. Klaatu gently takes Jacob’s hand in Helen's, closes his eyes, and concentrates. Bugs begin to run up Klaatu's wrist, coming out through Helen and Jacob's skin and burrowing bloodily into him. Jacob wakes up, Klaatu opens his eyes, and the pair look at each other while Helen stares wide-eyed. Klaatu stands up and walks towards the mouth of the tunnel. He looks back at Helen comforting Jacob, and she stares back at him. Klaatu steps out into the raging swarm and walks slowly through the swirling gray cloud, hand raised, vainly trying to protect his face and head. Holes appear in his suit, and his hands and face are bloody. As he approaches the sphere, he slowly sinks to his knees. With a final effort, he stands, reaches up, and touches the sphere. Light blazes as he is absorbed into it, and the sphere emits a beaming pulse of energy, causing the swarms, millions of bugs, to begin falling like rain to the ground.",
    "468": "A faint light illuminates the screen, flickeringly revealing an eighteenth-century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs. We are looking down into the wall of the staircase from the point of view of the landing, where a branched candlestick held by Salieri's Valet ascends the stairs, accompanied by Salieri's Cook bearing a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men are desperately worried: the Valet is thin and middle-aged; the Cook, plump and Italian, wearing shawls over their night-dresses and clogs on their feet, wheezing as they climb. The candles cast shadows on the peeling walls of the evidently old and decaying house. As they reach the salon door, a cat scuttles between their bare legs. The Valet tries the handle, and in horror, the two men stare at it as the door flies open, revealing Old Salieri lying on the floor in a pool of blood, an open razor in his hand. He has cut his throat but is still alive and gestures at them. They run to him, and we glimpse the room—an old chair, old tables piled with books, a forte-piano, a chamber-pot on the floor—as the Valet and the Cook struggle to lift their old Master and bind his bleeding throat with a napkin. The scene shifts to twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, and a full orchestra at a Masquerade Ball, where music slows and reveals a crowded room of dancers executing the slow portion of a fashionable dance from the early 1820s. As the fast music returns, Old Salieri is carried out of his house on a stretcher by two attendants and placed in a horse-drawn wagon under the supervision of a middle-aged doctor in a tall hat. The driver whips up the horse, and the wagon dashes off through the still-falling snow, galloping through the snowy streets of the city. Inside, Old Salieri, wrapped in blankets and half-conscious, is held by the hospital attendants, with Doctor Gulden staring at him grimly. The wagon arrives outside the General Hospital of Vienna, and a wide, white-washed corridor is seen where Doctor Gulden walks down with Father Vogler, the hospital's Chaplain. Several patients, some visibly disturbed, wearing white linen smocks, are noted in the corridor as Doctor Gulden, in a dark frock-coat, and Vogler, in a cassock, walk. Salieri propels his wheelchair to the forte-piano and plays an unrecognizable melody, then another tune, and continues to play with growing enthusiasm.",
    "1258": "She starts to climb over. They walk backstage at a music venue. It's full of equipment. They round a corner and walk out on stage and look at the vast Hollywood Bowl amphitheater. Hand-in-hand, Carl and Allison wander beneath the domed archway that covers the stage. They smile in awe. Carl turns to Allison, who stares out at the seats, lost in thought. He gazes at her. She turns to him and they smile. They look out again. They turn towards each other. Allison looks up at him. Allison leans forward and plants a kiss on his lips. She draws back and smiles impishly. Carl leans down and kisses her passionately but tenderly. He puts his arms around her and presses her to him. She puts an arm on his shoulder and squeezes affectionately. They stay locked in an embrace and sink to the floor. They sit in the deserted amphitheater. He eyes her gravely. A fat security guard with a torch chases them. Carl hands out oranges. People queue outside his office door. Lee's smile fades. Norman's po-faced. A motorbike. He approves the loan. Carl and Norman go into an office. A mustachioed man stands. They shake hands. Wesley, Carl, and Norman sit down at the table in the big office. Carl smiles. Norman gawks. Frowning, Carl stares. Norman nods. Carl and Lucy look at bridal shower invitations. She slowly turns and looks at him sadly. Carl nods sympathetically. Soo-Mi grins. Carl holds up a clenched fist. A guy runs in. Carl joins the crowd. Standing on the street, Carl stares into the distance with a steely resolve. He bursts into the tall, red brick apartment building and runs up a central staircase. The desperate man is standing on a ledge outside the top floor. Carl bursts into an apartment. Carl goes into the cluttered living room and looks around. He leans out of an arched window and looks at the guy on the ledge. He's a casually dressed, portly guy with thick, black hair. He looks into the room and sees a guitar. Carl points at the guy and goes inside. On the street, Soo-Mi and Lucy are standing in the crowd, looking up anxiously. Carl tunes the guitar. Carl leans out of the window, guitar in hand. As the crowd sings along, a fire crew arrives. The guy edges towards the open window. Carl grabs him by his jacket and throws him inside. He lands on his back. In shock, the guy holds up his hands. Carl gets out of an airport shuttle bus. As he walks towards the terminal building, Stephanie grabs his arm. She's with Ted. Carl goes. Stephanie glances back as she walks off.",
    "775": "Gordon eyes the controls nervously as the fissure approaches, and Jackson lands Gordon's hands on the throttle. Gordon pulls the controls up and the plane takes off as the runway disintegrates beneath. Noah stares wide-eyed as a canyon opens up beneath them and buildings fall into it. Gordon pilots the plane between tumbling sections of the freeway, then rolls to the right, while people run helplessly over jacked sections of broken roads and pavements. He flies low over the devastated center of town and struggles for height as the street rises. Lilly sobs as people and cars are thrown into the doom below, and as the plane dips into the rising canyon, a train arcs overhead, hits a wall, and explodes. The plane clears the canyon, and up ahead, two high-rise towers fall down, forming an upside-down V shape. Gordon pilots the plane straight through the gap as the building shatters all around them, and debris fills the sky as the light plane rises, narrowly avoiding the falling tower behind them. Jackson gawps as the plane clears the city, which has been carved in two by the gigantic fissure, and they stare at the devastation below. Noah gives tearful Lilly a big hug, as Jackson and Kate follow Gordon's gaze out of the windscreen. Behind them, the kids stare out of a side window as the Californian coastline bears up slowly and slips into the sea with explosions blossoming in the street, and buildings collapse as the whole state breaks apart and slides beneath the water. On board the Genesis, he is given a drink, and Harry steps off stage to take the phone call in the galley. Scotty knocks on Adrian's office window, and Adrian gestures for another minute, then gets up and paces. Adrian frowns sadly as Harry hangs up. Harry stands up and stops a passing waiter, as Tony can see them from the dressing room. Kevin, the waiter, pours Harry the double, and Tony watches Harry drinking. A biplane buzzes over the research facility of Yellowstone Park, where a grazing doe watches as Gordon makes a tentative landing. Jackson leaps out and checks a petrol pump while Jackson starts the RV and Noah answers his phone. Lilly spots Charlie on the ridge, and Jackson stops near the ridge. Both men look around dubiously as a huge flock of birds takes to the sky, and Lilly joins the two men on the ridge. They look around again as the undulating mountain range stretching out beneath them rises ominously, the land sinking to lift itself upwards. Lilly backs away slowly as a funnel of steam breaks through a crack in the ground below, and Charlie beams as they run off past Charlie's motorbike. Gordon steps onto the runway and checks his watch, while the mountains of Yellowstone are wrapped in a blinding flash and fulminating an awe-struck Charlie on the ridge.",
    "1098": "In Walt's house, Sue goes to the mesh door of the basement, and then he runs out of the back door, with Sue following him. It's night as Walt walks up outside Smokie's house and looks up at it, his face partly hidden in shadow. One of the gangsters looks out of the window and spots Walt. Smokie and Spider come out to confront him, more gangsters appear, and Spider pulls a gun. Neighbors watch. Walt points his index finger gun-like at the gangsters and mimes shooting them. He holds up a cigarette, puts it in his mouth, and slowly reaches inside his jacket, then whips his hand out again. The gangsters open fire, bullets riddle Walt's body, and he collapses backward onto the ground. His hand falls open, revealing his 1st Cavalry lighter, as blood trickles down his sleeve into his palm and some runs from his mouth. The cigarette lies unlit beside Walt's dead body, which lies in a cruciform. The lights of a police car flash in the darkness. Walt's Gran Torino pulls up outside Smokie's house, and Thao and Sue step out of it. They hurry over to a police officer as Sue, Thao, and Father Janovich watch a body bag being loaded into an ambulance. Father Janovich looks over to a patch of grass where the police have the handcuffed gangsters on their knees, and Thao bites his lip as a police captain looms over them. Sue and Thao watch bitterly as an officer leads Spider in handcuffs to a squad car, while another officer leads Smokie to a cruiser. Smokie's face is still bruised from where Walt whacked him, and he glares defiantly at Sue and Thao as the officer shoves him into the car. Thao breathes hard, with emotion welling up inside him, and Walt's Silver Star is still pinned to his T-shirt. Thao, Sue, and their mother leave their house, with Sue and Thao wearing traditional Hmong dress of lavishly embroidered clothing, and Sue also wearing a turban-like headdress, and get in a taxi. Grandma remains on the porch and watches as the taxi drives away, looking over at Daisy, who lies forlornly on the porch at the top of the steps. At the church, a large number of mourners have gathered for the funeral service. Wearing his new suit, Walt lies in an open casket in front of the altar as Mitch and Karen take a seat in the front pew aside Steve. Mitch looks across the aisle at Sue and Thao as Father Janovich steps forward. Mitch glares across the aisle at Thao. The family are gathered for the reading of the will, and Mitch and his brother Steve exchange a look as Ashley smiles in anticipation.",
    "1380": "Black howls, then bitterly amused, while Lupin eyes him and then turns back. Lupin eyes Black again and nods as the wands fly from their hands. The others turn to find Snape standing in the doorway, smiling smugly. As Black approaches, Snape puts his wand to Black's neck, and Snape's eyes harden as he gestures to the door. As the others start to go, Harry glances at the table where Lupin has left Harry's wand, and in a flash, it's in his hand. Snape soars into the air, hits the wall with a thud, and slides down, while Ron and Hermione stare in shock. Harry looks a bit shocked himself, then turns to Black and, as Harry points at Black, Black laughs mirthlessly and points at Ron. Ron goes white with fear as Scabbers squirms violently. Lupin and Black turn to Ron, who holds Scabbers protectively. Sirius and Lupin exchange a glance, neither speaks, while Pettigrew's small, watery eyes dart toward the windows and door. Suddenly, he makes a break for it, but Sirius merely shoves him back. Pettigrew's nose twitches, his gaze finding Harry, and his hands flutter nervously, revealing a missing index finger. As Pettigrew emerges from the gap, he prattles desperately. Harry studies Pettigrew briefly, then looks away and turns to see Hermione staring at the full moon. His eyes shift to Lupin, who is a rigid silhouette, his fingers twitching. Lupin shakes his head as Pettigrew's eyes dart, taking in the situation, then slowly shift to note the wand trembling in Lupin's lengthening fist. As Lupin's wand drops, Pettigrew leaps. Harry looks into his glassy eyes, and Harry's Patronus blooms briefly and dies. Harry's eyes flutter as the Dementors twist madly in his vision, drawing closer, and Black gasps, silvery feathers of light tumble from his lips as if his very soul were leaving him. Then a light splinters the trees, and Harry squints to see a fiery stag appear, its body luminous, slashing through the trees, sowing light in the darkness. Still, the stag charges on as the light expands, with the forest blazing with it, and the remaining Dementors flee, drifting across the moon like ash. The light ebbs, the stag's luminous body flickers, and there is a bright flash and darkness returns, a single thread of light all that remains, spinning down to the size of a pearl in the palm of a man standing deep in the trees. Harry studies the strangely familiar silhouette, then it is gone out of Hermione's shadow, which ripples against the curtain that encircles Harry's bed. Ron lies opposite with his leg bandaged as Hermione paces, stops, and Dumbledore hands Harry and Hermione each a stick of chocolate, then starts to go, stops, smiles, and exits. Harry glances curiously at the chocolate, but Hermione doesn't reply, instead looping the pendant's long chain around Harry's neck as well as her own.",

MJ hangs up on him, and Harry, with a dressing on the side of his head, crosses to Peter but then looks away and shifts uncomfortably. Peter looks thoughtful. At the Osborn home, Norman is pouring himself a drink from a decanter, takes a large gulp, and, hearing a noise, turns and moves as if in a trance, looking uncertainly around the room. On a shelf by the wood-paneled wall are reaching masks, and Norman stares at them before spinning around to look into a mirror where his reflection is talking to him. Norman looks at his reflection, which chuckles. Hoffman is in the office already when a cigarette thrown out by Jameson is tossed back, and the Green Goblin bursts in and grabs the editor by the throat from outside the windows. Vapor seeps out from the back of the Green Goblin's gloves straight into the face of Spider-Man, who's hanging upside down; he goes limp and falls toward the ground. The Green Goblin, on his glider, catches the unconscious figure and takes him to a rooftop, leaps on his glider, and shoots off into the night. At night, MJ walks out of a door and tosses something in a bin as Peter runs up and gulps, and she raises an eyebrow and smiles gently at him. As lighting illuminates the buildings around them, she runs across Puddle Street road and turns a corner. Peter, the wind ruffling his hair, sees two youths giving her the once-over, and he makes his move as they start to follow her. The rain falls, and MJ quickens her step as the two youths approach, while Peter is up on the roof changing out of his everyday clothes. Two more youths join in the chase, and in the backstreet, MJ is trapped by the gang of four. One grabs her by the shoulder, but she lashes out with her bag and feet as one guy draws a switchblade. Webs appear from nowhere, and the four assailants are dragged away from MJ. Spider-Man, without his mask, is clinging to a wall and somersaults onto the ground, taking on the four men with his strength overpowering them. Two end up crashing into windows behind MJ, and still in the shadows, Spider-Man drops the final assailant to the ground before moving off down an alleyway as MJ comes closer to him. When she reaches it, he's disappeared, but then he slinks down a wall headfirst, mask on. She stares at her superhero, reaches her hands up to just under his chin, which is level with her face, and slowly starts to peel the mask, revealing first his neck, and his chin, and finally, his lips.",
    "674": "Peter turns his head and runs towards a blazing apartment building, holding up the curb and reaching for the neck of his shirt as if to tear it open. He stops to look up at the fire, then steps back before racing across the street and into the burning building. Inside, he ignores the flames and runs up the stairs as more timbers fall behind and around him. He takes stock, hears screams, and runs. Reaching a locked door, he cups his hands to his mouth, charges with a shoulder, and raises his foot to the door, which clatters to the floor as he enters the apartment. Burning timbers fall from the ceiling, and inside is the girl. A chunk falls out of the landing, and with his hand pressed on the girl's head and her in his other, he hoists her onto the landing. Her parents are outside, and the girl on her knees helps Peter up onto firm footing. He picks her up again, and they set off as more burning beams crash to the floor. Her anguished parents hear the crashes from inside, then see Peter emerge with their daughter. He hands her over to her bemused parents and walks away. The flames are now out, and Peter stands in the road with an oxygen mask as two firemen cross. Peter, wearing a somber expression, turns away and is lost in thought. He stands at his room window, the frames weather-worn and in need of paint. A door opens behind him, and a tall scrawny girl named Ursula with pigtails steps outside, comes back in, and then goes back out again. Later, she sits on the end of his bed, watching as he finishes eating. He lays his fork on his plate, and she rises to collect it from him. He hands her his empty glass, and they stand facing each other. On her way out, she stops and hands him a note, then takes the plates and glasses with her as she leaves. Peter's attention is firmly on the note. At Aunt May's house, Peter walks down the passageway to the back garden where Aunt May is packing. She looks up, sees him, and carries on with her work. Smiling, she walks up to him, puts her arms around Peter, and hugs him close, her eyes closed. He looks solemn as she releases her hold and stares at him. She nods and moves away, bending down to pick up a brown paper carrier bag and wipe a tear from her eye. Peter looks around the boxes sitting in the back garden, bewildered, as a boy sulks and Peter's eyes glaze over.",
    "378": "Football hero Edward leads his team to victory. On the sidelines, a pretty girl admits the name of her secret love, and the other girls squeal in agreement. Don Price looks over and glowers. Edward takes an impossible shot at the buzzer from the other end of the court and, naturally, makes it, winning the game. As the crowd goes wild for Edward, Don Price is the only teammate who doesn't mob him. Edward carries a dog out of a burning house, and a flash occurs. Pissed, Don Price throws his crappy lima bean plants in the trash. As two farmers shake their heads, we reverse to show a massive hole punched through the side of a barn, roughly the shape of a man, but no human could be that large. We still haven't seen the full stranger. A mob of about 50 have gathered, many of them with shotguns, and amid the crowd, we see Don Price. There is agreement from the crowd, and then everyone turns to see who said that. The crowd parts to reveal none other than Edward Bloom. Don Price glowers as Edward climbs up the last bit of the steep hillside, reaching the mouth of a cave. Outside, buzzards squabble over the remains of the giant's feast: broken barrels, bones picked clean. In his most serious voice, Edward calls out. From deep in a cave comes a thunderous voice, and the giant's voice has such force that it blows Edward's hair back. A beat passes, then we hear a rumble, like a train coming. Edward braces himself, fists ready for a fight if that's what it's going to take. As the rumble gets louder, the ground starts to shake, and Edward wonders just how big this guy is. Edward picks up a stone, ready to play David to Goliath. Karl the giant is bigger than any man you've ever seen, completely feral, with a beard to his elbow and skin scratched and blistered. What remains of his clothes are ragged and muddy. Karl leans over Edward, blocking the sun. Edward throws his rock, but it just bounces off. Edward ponders the best response, settling on closing his eyes, hands at his side, ready to be eaten. Karl just stares at him, not sure what to do. After a beat, Edward opens his eyes a tiny bit, just to see what the giant is doing, and is relieved to see he's not licking his chops. Karl sits down with a boom, dejected. Reaching up, Edward shoves his hand into Karl's mouth, but the giant spits it back out. And that's the sad truth. Karl is less a monster than a freak—a giant man, but in the end, just a man. Edward takes a seat beside him.",
    "1004": "Gatsby notices Nick watching him and checks himself, and at the sound of the organ, Gatsby smiles. Nick and Daisy smile as Gatsby gestures towards the ballroom where Klipspringer, a wild-haired young man with glasses, plays the organ. Gatsby reclines on cushions while Nick and Daisy dance in the ballroom lit by hundreds of candles. Daisy spins around to face Nick, and they shimmy back and forth. As Gatsby watches, he remembers some time before in uniform, dancing with Daisy and kissing her. He looks grave as he remembers being in battle, while rain pours down on the terrace and the narrow dock that juts out into the bay. Across the water, the green light gently pulses through the mist. Klipspringer sleeps on the organ keys as Nick sits on the stairs having a drink, and Daisy and Gatsby slow dance together. Nick walks over to them while they gently sway and then leaves them. Daisy gazes at Gatsby lovingly, and he kisses her and rests his cheek against hers, as Nick watches them with a grave, serious expression. Extravagantly dressed guests go wild at one of Gatsby's parties, where they drink, dance, and splash about in the ornamental pool, while Gatsby smiles politely and walks through the party with Nick. Gatsby takes Daisy's arm, and Tom walks with Nick. Later, they sit at tables in a raised area looking down at the party where Gatsby smiles, and Tom looks bored, considers for a moment, and looks at Gatsby slightly bemused. The butler, Herzog, comes over and leans down to Gatsby as Mr. Slagle, a hard-faced man in a sharp suit, arrives with his associates. As the band plays, Gatsby and Tom share a polite smile, and Gatsby gets up, gesturing towards the dance floor where Daisy looks round and Gatsby smiles. They stand, and Daisy slips the silver pencil into Tom's breast pocket. Gatsby takes her arm and leads her down to the dance floor as Tom scans about and sees the attractive actress Marlene Moon, raising his eyebrows and nodding to her. An older guy dances with a younger woman as Gatsby dances with Daisy. Gatsby sees Tom and Nick follow Marlene upstairs, and she smiles brightly at Gatsby. Tom and Nick watch them dance, and Tom sees Marlene looking at him as if she's waiting. He goes to join her and glances back at Nick, who halfheartedly raises his glass before turning back to watch the dancing. Gatsby whispers something to Daisy and leads her away through the slow-dancing couples, as Nick watches, frowning. Outside, Gatsby follows Daisy through a gate and nods to a couple of servants as they cross the terrace. Nick has come outside and stands by a drinks table with a cocktail fountain on it.",
    "1050": "An uneasy silence descends, during which Mrs. Bennet winks at Kitty and Lizzie, gesturing to Jane and Mr. Bingley. Kitty glances at Jane, then at her mother, in confusion. She nods to Mr. Bingley, then leaves the room, followed by Mary and Kitty. Once they have left, Mr. Bingley sits back down. Lizzie casually takes up her embroidery, turning slightly to afford Mr. Bingley and Jane some privacy. Lizzie puts down her embroidery, smiles at Mr. Bingley, then leaves the room. She gives Jane a warning glance as she leaves. Mr. Bingley looks nervously down at Jane, who eventually raises her eyes demurely to meet his. An anxious Mrs. Bennet and the rest of the girls are sitting in another room, waiting. Mrs. Bennet sits with a smug expression. Moments later, Lizzie is skipping quietly down the stairs. She treads silently up to the door of the parlor, then walks inside to find her sister and Mr. Bingley standing together at the mantelpiece. Mr. Bingley leans in and whispers something to Jane, then takes his leave. Lizzie immediately turns to her sister. She kisses her sister on the cheek, then leaves the room. When she's gone, Lizzie's broad smile turns to an expression of contented relief. A little later, Mr. Bennet and the rest of the family are seeing Mr. Bingley out. Mr. Bingley smiles briefly at Jane, then climbs up onto his white horse. Mrs. Bennet waves her handkerchief at him as Mr. Bingley sets off. Mr. Bennet stands next to Jane. As they all head inside, Jane hangs back for a moment and turns to Lizzie. They walk indoors together arm in arm. An elegant carriage is arriving at Longbourn, complete with four horses and liveried footmen. Seeing this, Kitty quickly runs over to the house. Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter, Anne, are inside the carriage. She points over to the window and Lizzie and her mother quickly hurry over to see for themselves. As Lady Catherine steps inside, Lizzie, Kitty, and Mrs. Bennet all curtsy. With a haughty expression, she marches over to take a seat. Lizzie, Kitty, and Mrs. Bennet remain standing, looking at her with a certain amount of expectant unease. Lady Catherine heads out and Lizzie follows her, looking puzzled. Now, they're out in a less well-tended area of the garden, Lady Catherine striding ahead, with Lizzie a couple of paces behind her. She marches over to a clearing under a tree, bounded by two small stone benches, then turns to Lizzie. Relief floods Lady Catherine's face. She climbs into her carriage, leaving Lizzie breathless with anger. The carriage departs. Lizzie watches it go, her expression giving little away. She then turns indoors.",
    "266": "Ed's hand lingers on top of his, and Hi's other hand enters to rest on top of hers. Hi slips a ring off his own finger and slides it onto Ed's. The surly Mopping Con has now worked his way up to the foreground as Hi is being escorted past him to his cell. Halfway up the corridor, Hi points casually at the floor, and the Mopping Con turns to watch him recede. We begin to crane down to tighten on the absently staring Hi as Moses' voice is mixing down; we lose him from the frame. We are now very close on Hi, staring at the underside of the top bunk. A sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of Ed, smiling behind her camera, softly superimposed on the underside of the bunk. Hi wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts his eyes. Eyes closed, he is illuminated by a flash. Hi and the same three officers are in the familiar booking room, where Ed looks up from her camera, having just snapped a picture of another suspect against the hatched wall. Hi cocks a finger at the suspect. Ed nervously frets at her white bridal gown in front of a mirror, gazing earnestly into the camera. A congregation is seated behind her—the bride's side wearing police blues, and the groom's side, Hawaiian shirts—also staring into the camera. Over their shoulders stands the minister. The camera focuses on the newlyweds smiling at the camera and then on the newlyweds smiling at each other, profile to the camera, in the middle of a vast expanse of desert. Hi is working the drill press, wearing goggles and sweat-stained overalls. Next to him idly stands Bud, a veteran of the shop, with a grimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead. Hi is scowling at his paycheck, while behind the barred window, a fat cashier grins. Hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer. Both are wearing sunglasses, looking at the setting sun. The scene is suffused with a warm yellow light, which turns from yellow to amber as the sun sets. Hi and Ed watch, their heads following its slow downward arc. The amber turns to a more neutral dusky light as the sun sets, and Hi and Ed continue to stare at the point where it disappeared. The dusk slips away into darkness, and we are by now holding on pitch black. Crickets chirp from the darkness. Ed crosses off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red as Hi wearily enters after a long day at work, clutching his lunch pail. Ed flies into frame and leaps into his arms, covering him with kisses.",
    "867": "She sits hunched and clutching her chest where she was shot. Marius squats down and puts his arm around her. Drops of rain glisten on her pale face. Her eyes close. She reaches out to touch his face. Marius gazes at Eponine. Her hand drops to her side. Young Gavroche watches, a tear rolling down his cheek. Marius gently kisses Eponine's brow. Enjolras is also watching, grave-faced. Enjolras squats down. Marius helps him pick Eponine up and carry her away. Marius stares at Cosette's letter with tear-filled eyes. Holding her letter, he goes over to Gavroche. Gavroche hurries up a dark stairway to Valjean and Cosette's lodgings. Gavroche pulls it back, and Valjean offers a coin. Gavroche stops. Gavroche goes. Valjean reads the letter, frowning. Valjean looks up to the heavens. Valjean looks around, thoughtfully. Outside, Valjean steals a dead soldier's jacket, peaked cap, and musket. Disguised as a soldier, he makes his way to the barricade where students keep watch. He takes off his cap. He's let in, and guns are aimed at him. Javert has a noose around his neck. Valjean looks up. Valjean shoots a soldier off a rooftop. Gavroche hands Valjean a pistol. Beaten and bloody, Javert stares at Valjean slacked faced. He kneels with his hands tied and the noose around his neck. Valjean pulls his head up to face him. They stare into each other's eyes for a moment. Valjean hauls Javert to his feet and marches him to a dark corner. Valjean holds up a dagger. They stand facing each other. Valjean cuts the ropes binding his wrists. Javert walks off and turns back. Valjean aims his pistol. Valjean walks towards him. Javert frowns incredulously. Javert walks off. Valjean aims the pistol. He fires into a wall. Javert stops and looks back then heads off into the dark. Valjean goes back to join the others. They sit around regarding him with serious expressions. Valjean nods. Enjolras addresses the group. Marius stops adjusting the barricade and sits with the others. The wine is passed round. Frowning, Valjean listens to Marius. Marius sits clutching Cosette's handkerchief. Standing nearby, Valjean wears a fraught serious expression. He leans in a doorway. Valjean looks at Marius. Valjean stands beside the sleeping Marius. Marius stares at Enjolras fearfully. Everyone looks thoughtful. Soldier shoots at Gavroche who has climbed through the barricade. Gavroche is hit. Gavroche is shot again and flops on his back, dead. One of the students goes to pick him up and carries him back behind the barricade. Marius gives him cover with his musket. An army officer watches. Behind the barricade, Gavroche is laid on the ground. Enjolras looks around heavy brown. As cannons are rolled forward, the students shoot down a few soldiers.",
    "565": "EDGAR shoves LAUREL out through the driver's door and follows behind her, still holding his weapon on her. Behind him, abandoned on the front seat of the cab, we finally see the front of the postcard he's been carrying around. Jay flips back the plastic cover and jams his finger down on the red flashing button. As the LTD rockets toward the traffic jam up ahead, it begins to evolve, its shape actually changing. It becomes a larger, wirier machine, held together by an elaborate series of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons. Kay's car hurtles toward certain death in the traffic jam, but at the last possible moment, it swerves off to the side, a sucking sound coming from underneath it. Instead of banging off the wall of the tunnel, the LTD actually clings to it. It swerves up, onto the wall and hangs there, racing by the traffic below. It keeps going, turning all the way over and driving upside down, wheels clinging to the roof of the tunnel. Jay falls from his seat with a clunk, onto the upside-down ceiling of the car. Balled up on the back of his neck, he peers out the window as they tear through the tunnel, zooming over the bottlenecked traffic underneath. He reels, momentarily losing his grip on her. She takes advantage of the moment and flings herself out, into the air. Edgar flails, but she is beyond his reach. She falls, tumbling through the air and lands in the branches of a tree. She hits hard, the branches rattling, and reaches out and hangs on for dear life, high above the ground. Above, Edgar just keeps climbing. Over at the fence, the LTD comes to a looooong, skidding stop at the fairgrounds. At the trunk, Jay and Kay flip open the trunk and scarf up whatever weapons look most dangerous. Kay grabs a black box, unsnaps a row of latches, and opens it, revealing the most wicked-looking shotgun on the planet—three feet long, triple-barreled, over and under and under, plus a pump action reloader on top of a storage clip for a dozen more shells. The shells themselves are solid, glistening like polished steel. Kay loads up the clip. But then, there is a vacuum whump, like all the air in the immediate area being sucked into a space the size of a dime, and a tremendous shock wave rolls out from the barrel of the guns. Jay and Kay are sucked to the ground by the bizarre force, thudding to their stomachs like magnets to a refrigerator. The shock waves wrinkle across the open space between them and the ship, then it hits the ship, and it too is sucked back down.",
    "1310": "Joseph turns back to his father and takes his hand, while David looks down at his son who waits patiently. David twists around and looks back at the barbell, counting up the black metal circles, then turns back to Joseph. David looks back at the weights as Joseph starts back to the barbell. Joseph is breathing hard again as he finishes with the weights and comes around to David. David lays back, takes hold of the bar, lifts it off the armrest, and brings it down. His arms are straining hard again as he raises it and lowers it two times, which takes a sizable effort, and the weights bang down onto the armrest. David sits up, turns completely around, and looks at the barbell, counting the black discs on the steel bar. He just stares at the black steel circles on the metal bar as they both stare at the weight. Joseph moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house and waits. After taking another deep breath, David heaves, the weight CLINKS as it comes off the armrest, and he is full-out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms tremble as he lifts it for the second time, looking at his son whose eyes are wide, seeing the enormous amount of black discs on the bar. David's hands grip the metal, and he talks to Joseph, who stands in position at the bottom of the stairs without looking at him. David takes one last breath, and CLINK! the weights come off the rest, with his arms trembling immediately. His face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up again two times before dropping it onto the armrest. A set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans dangle by their metal handles on each side of the weights, and the four cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off David's chest, with his arms shaking hard. David sits up and turns back to the weights, his mouth moving as he calculates the discs and the cans until his lips stop moving. It takes a second for David to register the question as Elijah just keeps staring, his head nodding the slightest bit up and down, as the physician's words fade away and Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point in the room. Meanwhile, a co-worker finds Audrey working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a stationary bike and takes Audrey's position by the elderly man as Audrey crosses the physical therapy center, walking up to him with a smile. Elijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight.",
    "248": "The scene begins with going into Vincent's vein, followed by the heroin spurting back into the syringe, mixing with it, and then Vincent pushing down on the plunger. Vincent walks toward the house and pulls a note off the door before he enters, with video screens in the background and Mia's mouth coming toward a microphone. Vincent turns, walks, and finds the intercom on the wall. Vincent's Malibu then pulls up to a restaurant with a big sign featuring a neon figure of a cartoon surly cool cat jackrabbit in a red windbreaker towering over the establishment. Inside, Mia draws a square with her hands, causing dotted lines to appear on the screen, forming a square, which then disperse. Buddy exits as Vincent takes a look around the place, observing YUPPIES dancing, DINERS biting into big, juicy hamburgers, and icons playing their parts. He hands Mia a rolled smoke, which she takes and puts to her lips, and a Zippo lighter appears in Vincent's hand, which he uses to light it. He begins rolling one for himself as the sound of a subway car fills the diner, making everything shake and rattle, and Marilyn Monroe runs to a square vent in the floor, prompting the entire restaurant to applaud. Buddy returns with the drinks, and Mia wraps her lips around the straw of her shake while Vincent smiles, takes a sip, and slides the shake back. Mia powders her nose by doing a big line of coke off the bathroom sink, her head jerking up from the rush, as Vincent digs into his Douglas Sirk steak, scanning the Hellsapopinish restaurant with his eyes. Mia returns to the table, pointing at Marilyn in the white dress serving a table, and then at a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants taking an order from a bunch of film geeks, and Mia and Vincent smile. Vincent is slow to answer, and patrons cheer as Ed Sullivan stands with Marilyn Monroe holding a trophy. Marilyn holds the trophy as Mia holds her hand, and Vincent reacts. Vincent and Mia walk onto the dance floor toward Ed Sullivan, as patrons cheer again. They walk up to the microphone and make hand movements as they dance, before the front door flings open, and Mia and Vincent dance tango-style into the house. They finish their dance, laughing, and stand face to face looking at each other before Mia moves away to attend to both. Vincent hangs up his overcoat on a big bronze coat rack in the alcove, while Mia moves to her CD player, thumbs through a stack of CDs, and selects one: k.d., which blasts out of the speakers with a high-energy country number as Mia plays air-guitar, dances her way around the room, and finds herself wearing Vincent's overcoat.",
    "923": "The wooden gates open, and Bond heads down a long, straight brick tunnel. He stops, gets out, and opens the boot to reveal a man blinking up at him. Bond is elevated in a pool of light and fires a bullet in a super slow-mo burst of smoke, with the bullet-stream of smoke moving over the sand dunes. Light surrounds the sun, and a shadowy Bond aims his pistol, with Bond's shadow passing over the dunes. A red dot travels sideways as a naked woman is silhouetted by the sand, lying over the dunes in the half-light. Bond stands in the low light as fine sands flow like liquid, and a woman's naked body emerges from the flowing sand. Bond turns, aiming his gun, while a gloom-shaped hood of lights surrounds the scene. A naked woman stands in silhouette, and Bond falls into billowing sand. Sand and stars swirl amidst the gloom of light, and the grid flexes, turns, and walks as the sand billows against the starry darkness. A crowd of naked women pose in silhouette around the glaring sun, forming circles of bodies that animate into a flickering blur and dissolve away, floating through space. Sand swirls in the light while posing high-heels form a slowly turning pattern. Bond falls towards the expanding people in the eye, and sand engulfs a pistol as Bond falls in slow motion onto the sandy ground. He raises his pistol and fires in super slow-motion, with the bullet spinning slowly as it flies. The red dot travels sideways as the sun flares behind a pile of naked women, and the bullet lands in an explosion of sand. A red and yellow checked flag billows in the breeze as a procession of people in bright costumes parades around a square, watched by huge crowds. Bond dumps the man from the boot onto a chair in a cellar, where M and another agent watch. Bond gulps whiskey while near-tired horsemen enter the square, laid out as a racetrack. A chair is dragged across a stone floor, and Bond sits next to Mr. White, joined by M. Mitchell drops one agent, and as M goes down, the horse race starts. Bond leaps on the man, grabs the gun, and the prisoner is hit and goes down. Bond disarms Mitchell and kicks the gun away but then gets booted to the ground. Mitchell goes for the gun and runs off as the fast and furious Palio horse race thunders around Siena's main square. Mitchell pounds down spiral stairs and into water at the base of a tower, then dives through an iron gate. Bond ignores the stairs and takes a flying leap after him. In the race, a rider falls, and Bond chases his man down a watery tunnel, but a gate bars his way.",
    "837": "Sandy does a double-take. She smiles and waves, shifting her timid gaze on the way to the bar, while he smiles at Diana as he stands, and she fingers her necklace. Now, they sit at a table with a beautiful view of the Gateway Arch. Sandy sips champagne and nods, but her smile fades as he stares into her somber eyes. Diana sips champagne and wipes her eyes, while Sandy's gaze softens. He faces the table as she wipes her cheeks and looks down at her hands, and he offers a napkin. She takes another sip as Ken, the hotel manager, and several policemen enter behind Sandy. As the officers cuff them, Sandy shares a frightened look with Diana. An officer leads Sandy out while the others follow with Diana, and the restaurant patrons gawk from their tables. The group proceeds past the hostess and into the hall, where an elevator arrives. Wearing a nice suit and a sleek, black dress, Julian and Marisol enter as the doors close, standing in the front with their backs to everyone. Noticing them, Diana's eyes widen, and she glances between Sandy and the thugs. Sandy looks up as Marisol turns away, and stepping forward, he eyes Julian up and down. They exit into the lobby, and Julian glances back as Sandy and Diana share a concerned look on their way out, while the thugs head out in a different hallway. Now, in his prison cell, Paolo grabs his phone. The skiptracer shoots Julian in the leg, and Marisol holds her hands up as he shoots her in the foot. Now, the two thugs lie in a car's trunk. Outside, an officer escorts Diana around a squad car, and Sandy glances over as they both get into the back seat. Diana stares ahead, avoiding his gaze, while nearby, the skiptracer watches from the thugs' silver sedan. As the squad car leaves, he quickly follows. Now, they cruise down a construction-filled street with opposite lanes divided by orange traffic cones. Sandy stares straight ahead in the back seat, with a determined glare as the skiptracer follows close behind. Diana glances over at Sandy, then leans toward the grated divider separating them from the officers. She uncuffs a hand, and suddenly, she bangs her cuffed wrist against the back windshield, then kicks out the glass. The skiptracer swerves and then spins a 180, sliding into the squad car's side, as another car rear-ends them. They crawl out, and the skiptracer aims. The skiptracer drives forward, knocking several cars out of the way, and barrels through traffic dividers, into the opposite lane. They see a highway beneath them as the skiptracer steers through oncoming traffic. Following Diana, Sandy trips off the curb and lands in a closed-off lane, as the skiptracer crashes through the dividers, heading straight for him.",
    "1366": "Pete is on the toilet playing Scrabble on his iPad when she angrily grabs his iPad and walks out. Pete stands on stage speaking to a small crowd, and the crowd applauds as Graham Parker, in his 60s, leaps on stage. Pete and Debbie watch Graham sing a very moving song, but although the music is great, it's a little depressing and not working on Debbie, so she quickly gets bored. Later, Pete and Debbie are driving home when an ambulance drives by with sirens blaring. They walk in mid-argument to find Sadie listening to a song on her iPhone, and everyone laughs and dances. Pete turns the iPod off, starts dancing around like it is fun, then stops his music. The next morning, Pete sits with the kids to eat breakfast while Debbie scurries around to prep them for school. Charlotte runs away towards her room, and Sadie screams, prompting Debbie to cover Sadie's mouth. Another parent, Beth, and her adorable child walk over, and then Beth and Katie walk off. As they walk into class, the teacher pulls Debbie aside but walks away before Debbie can defend herself. As Debbie pulls out of the lot, she lights a cigarette. Meanwhile, Pete paces around his office on the phone and is with Ronnie and Cat, employees at his record label, watching an electronic press kit for Graham Parker, featuring a montage of his performances from the seventies to the present. There is a scene with Graham and a journalist wearing a yarmulke, and another with Pete, Cat, and Ronnie, before Graham walks up. Pete and Debbie talk while Debbie holds a list of changes she wants to make, and Pete picks up a guitar and starts playing with it. Later in bed, Debbie has a computer on her lap, watching security cam footage of the store, revealing Desi's boyfriend entering, sitting behind the counter, with her on his lap as they kiss. Desi seems to be popping up and down a little. Meanwhile, Pete farts several times, each longer, until Debbie hits him with a pillow and he farts again. Charlotte jumps around in front of Sadie's door as Sadie sits on her bed doing homework. Charlotte grabs her head as if being dragged away and plays air guitar. Pete tosses a packet of M&M's in the garbage, throws out all of his cupcakes except for one, and takes a bite, trying to throw it away but eventually takes another bite, holding it over the garbage before finishing what little remains. Finally, Pete runs on a treadmill while getting an electrocardiogram.",
    "1145": "Cedric has come in through another entrance, and as confused as Harry, he runs along the narrow paths between the neatly clipped hedges, stopping uncertain of which way to go, before choosing a path. As he moves forward, it crashes closed in front of him, and the hedges on either side grow together, hemming him in. He forces his way through the dense branches as they close in around him, lashing him across the face. Meanwhile, Viktor plods along in his steady boots, carrying his wand, and Harry spins around as he hears a sound behind him. Viktor's eyes are glazed over. Fleur runs frantically between the hedges, reaches a dead end, panics, runs back the way she came, and, with her face clammy with fear, she stares uncertainly down the misty pathway. Hearing something behind her, she turns, and Harry hears her scream. Viktor leans over Fleur, who lies on the ground, staring slightly, and looks up with his eyes cloudy. Sinuous roots creep towards Fleur from under the hedge. Harry runs in the direction of the scream, peers through the swirling mist, and spots Viktor. Harry draws back into the hedge as Viktor shines the lighted end of his wand straight into Harry's face, but, as Viktor's eyes are clouded over and he fails to see Harry, he passes by. Harry searches for Fleur, and as he reaches her, she vanishes from sight, drawn under the hedge by a tangle of sinuous roots. Harry points his wand upwards, and high above, red sparks explode in the evening sky. A howling wind lashes the branches, sending dust and leaves into the air. Harry starts to run as the hedges start to close together behind him, diving head first through a closing gap and landing on the ground. Harry sees a bright object in the distance, and heading towards it, he emerges onto a path between Cedric and Viktor. Harry drops as Cedric aims his wand at Viktor, knocking him unconscious, kicking Viktor's wand from his hand, and raising his own wand. Harry stops him, but Cedric pushes him off and starts to run, with Harry following. They jostle for position, grabbing each other by the shirt, pulling each other's back, fighting each other off, and they see the trophy. They sprint forward, Cedric slightly ahead, and the Triwizard Trophy gleams through the mist. The roots reach out and trip Cedric, and Harry surges past, then stops and looks back. Cedric is dragged backwards, tangled in the roots and branches of the hedge, struggling in vain to escape as the sinuous roots have twined around his neck, strangling him. Harry looks at the gleaming trophy and back at Cedric, and as he points his wand, the roots and branches loosen their hold.",
    "1369": "Pete takes a framed item off of his wall, and then Larry answers the door, where Pete stands with a framed drawing made by John Lennon and hands it to him. Meanwhile, Sadie and a bunch of other kids are building sets for a school play, and Sadie talks with a friend while Pete and Debbie watch from afar, sitting next to each other. Debbie tries to gently break the news, feeling totally deflated, and then she walks through the campus upset. She sees a kid, darts over to him, and encounters Joseph, the kid who insulted Sadie on her Facebook. Debbie becomes quieter, scarier, and more confrontational, causing Joseph to look upset, and then she storms off. Debbie pulls open the door to find Pete on the toilet playing on his iPad; she exits, and Pete flips her off after she's gone. Later, Debbie and Desi are talking as they walk down the stairs into a loud club, where they talk to a group of young men, one of whom takes a plate of his teeth out. Desi tries to put them in her mouth, and everyone laughs, as she looks insane and tries to kiss Debbie. Still laughing, she hands the teeth back to their owner, who pops them back in to cheers from the crowd. Elsewhere, Pete is on stage in a half-filled nightclub, watching Graham Parker perform with his band. The song resonates with Pete, reflecting the issues he is facing and prompting a strong emotional connection. Billie Joe Armstrong sits nearby, watching the show as Desi and Debbie dance with hockey players to a Nikki Minaj song, with Debbie letting loose and having the time of her life. Debbie talks to a hockey player named Jay, who is twenty-four and cute, making them both laugh. As Graham packs up, Pete approaches him, and Billie Joe comes over to congratulate Graham before they walk away. Pete sits in the car, crying while Debbie drops Desi off at her apartment, where Debbie looks shocked, and Desi nods. Pete is later on his iPad, lying in bed when Debbie comes in to talk, her shirt unbuttoned and topless. She exits into the bathroom, and after a silence, she returns dressed, prompting Pete to walk out of the room, with Debbie following. Charlotte plays piano in her room alone, overhearing Debbie and Pete fighting through the wall, leading Debbie to start walking away. The family then lays in bed watching Spongebob Squarepants, but the atmosphere is tense as Charlotte licks her fingers, pokes Sadie with her wet fingers, resulting in Sadie leaving and slamming the door. Charlotte writes a note at her desk, walks by Sadie's room, and puts the note on the door. Pete sits alone, listening to music.",
    "424": "Bert takes a seat. Findley has a mischievous look on his face as he brings out a cloth bag and pours out the three billiard balls on the table. Eddie shoots. His red ball ricochets off the shoulder and returns to kiss the third ball. Findley steps up to the bar, leaving Bert and Eddie alone. Findley points to a statue on a table behind the couch. It is a figure of Pan, with horns sticking up through his curly head, and the legs of a goat extending down below his waist. Findley completes a shot, then lays his cue gently on the table and goes to the bar. Eddie, his coat off, rubs his hand nervously. Bert turns his back on Eddie and joins Findley at the bar. Eddie stands helplessly for a moment. Findley pours a drink as Eddie approaches. He reaches in his pocket, then remembers that he gave his money to Sarah. He bounds up the stairs. He bursts into the room, goes past Sarah, stretched out on the bed, and takes the money out of her purse. She is facing away from him but her eyes are open. She listens to him as he shuts the door loudly on his way out. Eddie leaps down the stairs, two at a time. Bert eyes Eddie with controlled rage as the two get ready to play again. A game has just ended as Sarah quietly descends the stairs. She stands at the rail, listening. Bert sits with his shoes up on the couch. Eddie turns and sees her. His eyes are shut tight; his balled-up fists rub against his temples. A stunned Eddie moves to the billiard table. Defeated, Sarah turns and goes up the stairs. The men return to the table to continue their game. Bert, deeply satisfied, puts on his coat and sits to watch the action. A shaken Findley flops into a leather swivel chair. A bucket of iced champagne sits on the desk, ready to be emptied. Findley puffs on his cigarette as he looks at the impatient face of Bert, slouching in the chair across from him. Eddie leans against a wall nearby. He is quiet, morose. Eddie moves to leave. Findley and Bert watch him go. Eddie waits for Bert to come down the stairs. Eddie abruptly turns and walks out of the house. Bert watches him for a moment then follows. Bert enters his suite, removes his overcoat, then looks at the door that divides his room from Sarah's. He seems hesitant, unsure of himself. He pours himself a drink and downs it in one gulp, walks to the door, listens, and opens it himself without knocking. Sarah is there, seated primly on the bed.",
    "121": "He takes his lighted cigarette from the ashtray, puffs it two or three times, and kills it, then picks up the horn again. As he goes on speaking, the scene slowly dissolves to palm trees lining the street with middle-class houses, mostly in Spanish style. Some kids throw a baseball back and forth across a couple of front lawns, while an ice cream wagon dawdles along the block. Neff's coupe meets and passes the ice cream wagon and stops before one of the Spanish houses. Neff gets out, carrying a briefcase, with his hat a little on the back of his head, and his movements are easy and full of ginger. He inspects the house, checks the number, goes up on the front porch, and rings the bell, then pushes past her into the house. The style is Spanish throughout, with a wrought-iron staircase curving down from the second floor and a fringed Mexican shawl hanging down over the landing. A large tapestry hangs on the wall. Neff looks up to see Phyllis Dietrichson standing and looking down. She is in her early thirties, holding a large bath-towel around her torso, down to about two inches above her knees. She wears no stockings, no nothing. Neff looks up, takes his hat off, and she glances over her towel costume, then turns away as gracefully as one can with a towel for a wrapper. Neff watches Phyllis out of sight and speaks to the maid while still looking up, then goes through the archway as the maid goes off the other way. Neff comes into the room, throws his briefcase on the plush davenport, and tosses his hat on top of it. He looks around the room, moves over to a baby grand piano with a sleazy Spanish shawl dangling from one side, and two cabinet photographs standing in a staggered position on top, which he glances over: Mr. Dietrichson, about fifty-one, a big, blocky man with glasses and a Rotarian look, and Lola Dietrichson, age nineteen, wearing a filmy party dress and a yearning look in her pretty eyes. Neff walks away from the piano, takes a few steps back and forth across the rug, and his eyes fall on a wrinkled corner. His back is to the archway as he hears high heels clicking on the staircase. He turns and looks through the arch to see Phyllis Dietrichson coming downstairs, first her feet with pom-pom slippers and a gold anklet on her left ankle, and as the camera pulls back slowly while she descends, we see all of her in a pale blue summer dress. He crosses to the davenport to get the policies from his briefcase, as she turns away from the mirror and sits in a big chair with her legs drawn up sideways, the anklet now clearly visible.",
    "571": "The LTD pulls to a stop at the end of the driveway leading to Beatrice's farmhouse, where the alien ship landed, and the wrecked pickup truck is still there. Jay and Kay get out, appearing as very undercover cops, and Jay starts up the driveway while Kay pulls a black card from his wallet and extends it to Beatrice as she draws close. Beatrice looks much better than before, more nicely dressed, with a touch of makeup and a smile on her face. In the living room, Jay sips some of her lemonade and winces as a little giggle escapes her at the thought. Kay is in the hole where the ship landed, investigating with a pocket spectral analyzer over a section of scorched earth, and above him, Jay leans over, staring down as Kay looks up at him and the analyzer shifts colors from red to yellow, then purple, and green. It's Dr. Laurel Weaver, the woman who tried to speak to Jay before. Laurel signs his clipboard, gives him a dirty look, but he laughs and leaves. She goes to the stretcher, bends down, and gently pets Rosenberg's cat. She looks up to see Jay and Kay standing there, then goes to the Arquillian's body on a table under the lights, throws back a sheet revealing the fully dissected Arquillian, and begins to examine it. Jay and Laurel cross the room to where Rosenberg's corpse lies on another gurney, and she snaps her rubber gloves and reaches down, sinking her hands into the body as she moves things aside, which by Jay's expression, is very disgusting. From the other side of the room, Kay clears his throat, and Jay walks across the morgue to Kay, who is still examining the Arquillian. Jay turns and races across the room to rejoin her, leans down, and notices strange stitching around the base of Rosenberg's ear. He reaches out, touches the ear, turns it, and with a soft pull, the ear comes away from the head like a latch. Jay pulls again, and Rosenberg's entire face pushes out with a mechanical hum and hinges open, the whole face rotating away from the rest of the artificial skull. A tiny little green man, gravely wounded but not quite dead, staggers up out of a small control room inside Rosenberg's head, with gearshifts and viewing screens all around the inside of the skull. The Baltian nods vigorously, nods again, falls, and dies. Kay and Jay are not paying attention to Laurel when FLASH! Without even looking at her, Kay whips out his neuralyzer and blanks her out.",
    "1120": "They scuttle across the floor, up the wall, over the stone window sill, and out through a crack in the glass. They see something else on the floor. A pool of water reflects writing on the wall above. Harry sees something else. A cat, stiff as a board, is hanging by its tail from a lamp bracket. Students appear at each end of the corridor. Seeing the cat, they stare suspiciously at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Colin prepares to take a photograph, but somebody stops him. Draco reads out the writing on the wall. Filch pushes his way through the gaping crowd. He sees his cat. He grabs Harry. Dumbledore sees the writing on the wall. He indicates Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Lockhart stares at the cat. Ron gives her a warning look. Snape looks unconvinced. Later, the staircases swing from side to side into different positions. As the children go upstairs, Hermione turns to Ron and Harry. A portrait on the wall nods in agreement. A classroom. A black and white bird becomes a glass goblet. Ron waves his wand. Scabbers becomes a goblet with a waving rat's tail. Professor McGonagall seems uncertain. She looks at the expectant students. Hermione is concerned. Ron turns to face a smug Draco. Outside the classroom. In the library, Hermione takes down a book from a shelf and shows it to Ron and Harry. Hung with heraldic designs, tall spectator towers surround the oval arena of the Quidditch pitch. The players swoop above the arena on their broomsticks, high over the heads of the excited crowd. The Slytherin captain hurls the Quaffle towards the goal, but the Gryffindor Keeper knocks it safely away. Ducking and diving, a Gryffindor grabs the Quaffle and flies with it. It's knocked away and passed high in the air to a Slytherin. Marking an opponent, Harry swoops around the back of a tower. He hovers watching as a well-aimed Slytherin pass sends the Quaffle flying straight through the goal. The Slytherin supporters are ecstatic as the points go up on the scoreboard. The professors applaud. The Slytherin captain encourages his team. They fly in formation, their green cloaks streaming behind them. Harry ducks as a wood bat narrowly misses his head. Lucius Malfoy and Snape are watching the match together, sitting in the professors' grandstand. Looking out for the Golden Snitch, Harry and Draco, the two Seekers, hover above the arena. A wooden Bludger almost hits Harry. His captain shouts a warning. The Bludger hurtles back. The Bludger smashes Wood's broomstick to smithereens. Then it turns and heads straight for Harry, chasing after him. Hagrid is following the game through a pair of binoculars. A new Bludger smashes through a tall tower.",
    "1286": "They sit with the windscreen wipers and headlights still on. He gets out of the car and walks towards a taxi from which an elderly Chinese man is emerging accompanied by a young man holding an umbrella. In the restaurant, the young man brings a cup to the old man. The old man and Klaatu sit facing each other. Helen and his grandson are at another table. She stares at him. Helen looks at the men, then lowers her eyes. Klaatu studies the old man expressionlessly. High metal panels are pushed into place forming a triangular wall around the robot. A lid is dropped in place on top. The Colonel grins nervously. Police cars speed down a street at night. Helen is driving towards the Highlands, New Jersey. In a wooded area, Klaatu gets out of the car. Jacob stares after him. Baffled, he looks out of the window. Watched by Jacob, she walks off following Klaatu. It's pitch-black. She moves slowly through the darkness. She cowers, covering her head, as insects swarm around her. She comes to a pond. The surface of the water begins to bubble and light shines up from beneath the surface. Hiding behind a tree, she watches as a sphere about 10 feet high rises to the surface of the pond. Lights and dark mists swirl within it. Fish and other animals are attracted to it. A frog and a lizard leap into the water heading towards it. It drifts towards the edge of the pond. Klaatu approaches it. Light flares beneath his hand and ripples across the surface as he touches it. Choppers circle the sphere in Central Park. Another sphere sits in the middle of a desert. A burst of light shoots across the surface. Desert creatures, scorpions and snakes, make their way towards it. A similar burst of light spreads out across the surface of a sphere in a jungle. A fishing boat sits on a calm sea. Behind it, a vast sphere similar to the one in New York breaks the surface. Klaatu stares into the pond sphere. Helen watches from a distance as he concentrates, his hand resting on the sphere's surface. She makes her way back to the car. She gets into the driver's seat and sits looking stunned. She stares straight ahead. Video footage shows people milling around a sphere in South America. A screen shows a sphere being blasted with a flamethrower, making the surface transparent. Creatures squirm inside. Helen and Jacob wait in the car in the woods. She gets out of the car and follows the boy as he heads into the darkness. They're bathed in a brilliant light. Both stare in amazement as the sphere from the pool, blazing with white light, rises slowly into the air.",
    "1300": "Graham comes down the stairs with his overcoat on, moves to the closet door, knocks on it before opening it, and starts down the hall. Merrill steps out of the closet for the first time. Meanwhile, Morgan pulls his eye away from the telescope set up on the window seat in his room, and Bo hugs Morgan tight, who then peels Bo's arms off of him. Graham unlocks the front door, looks down the hall shocked, and does not react but keeps staring. In another scene, Ray clutches the steering wheel tightly, turning his knuckles a yellow white, with two large bags overflowing with clothes in the truck. Graham glances at the backseat of the truck, his eyes gently move back to Ray, and drift down to the two blood-stained areas on his shirt. Tears start falling down Graham's face as Ray finally turns, his red face quivering as he talks. Ray looks at Graham, and the two men stare at each other for a beat before Ray looks away and puts the car in drive. Graham steps away as the truck moves forward and pulls down the driveway. Merrill's head is leaned against a bunch of winter coats with his eyes closed, which then open as he sits up in his chair. The chair in the closet creaks as Merrill leans forward a little towards the television screen as running is heard. Graham waits for a reply, but none comes, so he bends down where he stands and puts his head near the wood floor to try and look under the door. All he can see are the bottoms of a couple shelves in the corner of the pantry, as he's at too severe an angle. Graham sits up, only four feet away from the pantry door, looks around not knowing what to do, and his eyes fall on a bunch of kitchen knives that have spilled from a drawer onto the floor. He takes a butcher knife from the group, moves closer to the door, and uses the knife like a mirror to see under the door. Graham watches the soft reflection and then pulls the knife out. He sits there kneeling two feet from the door, takes a deep breath, and starts to lower his head under the slanted table but stops halfway down as he loses his nerve and sits up. Graham rises to his feet, places the butcher knife on the counter, starts walking across the kitchen, gets to the door, and stays like that for a long time. Then, Graham lets go of the doorknob, turns, and walks quickly across the kitchen, picks up the butcher knife, kneels down next to the pantry, ducks his head under the slanted kitchen table, places his cheek to the floor only inches from the bottom of the door, and looks into the pantry.",
    "1222": "More corpses of people and animals litter the dry muddy ground, and a man has his head partially blown away alongside a child skeleton. En-Joo looks moody and throws away a cigarette. BN leads them away but is suddenly alerted, and BN and the mercenaries take cover behind charred sticks of timber framework. They watch as a military lorry with a covered tail pulls into view and drives along the edge of the paddy field, where it stops. Soldiers push a group of five male peasants off the tailboard and into the dirt at gunpoint as School Boy looks across at Diaz. The soldiers toss primed grenades into the paddy field, and the peasants are lined up at the edge. Diaz frowns and glances at the hanging severed head while one of the troops points his rifle into the air. The peasants take the gunfire as the signal to begin a race across the paddy field, stumbling desperately through the water as BN watches horrified and the mercenaries wear grim expressions. In slow motion, the peasants' feet slosh through the water, but they all make it successfully to the other side of the field and slump on the bank. A soldier shouts angrily and kicks one of the peasants in the head, then raises his rifle, firing bullets that hit the ground near the peasants. The troops angrily gesture to the frightened men to cross the field again, but as a soldier raises his rifle, he gets an arrow in the back. Rambo runs through the trees, letting fly with arrows from his bow as School Boy looks astonished. A soldier gets an arrow in the back as he tries to escape, then one in the head, while another catches one in the leg and eye, falling into the paddy field onto a grenade. The peasants scramble towards BN and the mercenaries, and Rambo joins them and speaks to BN. Lewis turns his back on Rambo, who draws an arrow on Lewis and aims it at the bald man's right eye. The other mercenaries cover Rambo with their weapons, glancing at each other worriedly until Rambo lowers the bow and arrow from Lewis' face, making Lewis look relieved. They move as rain pelts down on the military camp at night, where the troop sits smoking and drinking beer in the mess hut, watching women perform an exotic dance routine on a stage. Sarah languishes in the pig sty with her hair untidy, clothes dirty, and dark bags under her eyes, looking up through gaps in the floorboards as the commander walks calmly back and forth. Meanwhile, the mercenaries have commandeered the soldiers' truck and are driven along a dirt track towards the camp, with Lewis holding a torch.",
    "1363": "Abby rolls her eyes with a smile and goes inside. As Mike is walking away, he turns back for a moment, then keeps walking. Abby looks away haughtily. Abby sits on the couch staring at a box of ELECTRIC. She opens the box, dumping out a pair of underwear and a REMOTE CONTROL. Abby checks herself out in the mirror. As Abby, Mike, and Colin walk into the bar, two buxom blonde twin JELLO GIRLS, BAMBI and CANDI, rush up to Mike. They slap him on the back, eyeing the twins. The group sits down at the table. Abby tries to kick Mike. As she does, she unwittingly knocks over her purse. The contents spill out, and the REMOTE for her vibrating underwear rolls away, stopping UNDER THE TABLE. A PRECOCIOUS KID, 8, sits with his parents. A small RED LIGHT turns on. As Harold and Bob laugh, Stuart slaps Mike on the back. Suddenly, her smile quickly changes to horror. She shifts in her seat, trying to control her NOW-VIBRATING. She leans down to grab her purse. She pokes her head under the table to see that the contents of her purse have spilled. Mike's head appears next to hers. Mike starts laughing. Stuart watches, worried, as Abby rises from underneath the table, clutching her head and looking around frantically, trying to figure out who has the remote. The kid has flicked up the speed on the remote even higher. Abby's eyes roll back. She starts to get up when Stuart stops her. Candi looks at Harold, intrigued by Abby's display. As Stuart frowns, concerned, Abby spasms, then rushes through it as fast as she can. She leaps to her feet. As they all walk out, Mike grabs the remote from the kid. Abby spots this and snatches the remote out of Mike's hand. She shoots him a look. Colin walks up. On set, Mike addresses the camera. NEARBY, a confused Joy looks at Abby. Georgia winks at him. Abby looks at the agent, confused. The CAB DRIVER looks at her. Mike walks out of the lobby, as Abby gets out of a cab, suitcase in hand. Abby glares at him, about to show her true feelings, but then quickly covers. Abby and Mike sit in the backseat. Abby looks down at her notes. Mike studies her. Abby sits there, fuming that he's right. Mike looks at her, surprised. The audience applauds as Mike takes a deep breath and heads on stage. Abby now sits in the audience, watching as Jay interviews Mike on stage. Abby talks on the phone. Abby's surprised, then suspicious. The waiter arrives with mojitos. Abby looks at him. Abby sips her mojito, studying Mike.",
    "123": "She fixes him a glass of tea while he is looking around, then hands him the tea. He picks up his hat and goes out, and she looks after him. Neff bangs the front door shut, walks quickly to his car, and drives away. Shooting past Neff sitting behind the wheel of his car, the car hop hangs a tray on the door and serves him a bottle of beer. Neff goes bowling and rolls the ball with an effort at concentration, but his mind is not really on the game. It is a six-story building in the Normandie-Wilshire district, with a basement garage. The camera pans up the front of the building to the top-floor windows as a little rain starts to fall. Neff stands by the window with his coat off and his tie loose, while raindrops strike against the glass. He turns away impatiently, paces up and down past a caddy bag with golf clubs in it, pulls one out at random, makes a couple of short swings, throws the club on the couch, and paces again. Neff goes to the door and opens it, and then just looks at her. She has nothing in her hands but her bag, and he looks down at her hands. She comes in, and he closes the door. Neff switches on the standing lamp, and she starts to take off her coat. He takes her coat and lays it across the back of a chair as Phyllis has moved over to the window and stares out through the wet window-pane. By this time, he has hold of her wrist, draws her to him slowly, and kisses her. Her arms tighten around him. After a moment, he pulls his head back, still holding her close. He lets her go and moves toward the dinette, which contains a small table and some chairs. A low glass-and-china cabinet is built between the dinette and kitchen, leaving a space like a doorway. The kitchen is the usual apartment house kitchen, with a stove, ice-box, sink, etc., and it is quite small. Neff goes to the ice-box and Phyllis drifts in after him. He points at the china closet and has taken a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator, holding it under the hot-water faucet. Phyllis has the glasses now and hands them to him. He dumps some ice cubes into the glasses, reaches for the whiskey bottle on top of the china closet, and hands her a glass. They move back toward the living room, where Phyllis and Neff go toward the davenport and sit on it, fairly close together. He puts his arms around her, kisses her, and holds her tight, their heads touching side by side, as the camera slowly starts to recede.",
    "362": "Pippin looks on in frightened awe as Sam and Gollum lead Frodo to the stairs. Above Minas Morgul, the sky is bright with light as the city erupts. Faces of soldiers and civilians of Minas Tirith watch from the parapets of the city as Frodo and Sam sink to the ground, holding their hands against their ears, as out of the city comes a rending screech, shivering and rising swiftly to a piercing pitch beyond the range of hearing. The terrible cry ends, falling back through a long sickening wail to silence. Frodo squeezes his eyes shut, clutching at his shirt as if it's on fire. The cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open, and a huge army marches out—rank upon rank of armor-clad orcs moving swiftly and silently, passing close to Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of ragged columns. Seventy-five thousand orcs march to war, just below Frodo, while Frodo, Sam, and Gollum climb the stony stairs high above the marching army. Gandalf is thinking and calculating as he strides through the back streets of the city so determined and purposeful that Pippin has to run to keep up. Gandalf suddenly stops and looks down at Pippin, kneels down, and looks at Pippin earnestly, his hand on Pippin's shoulder, before watching as Pippin hurries away. An ancient stone bridge spans the ruins of east and west Osgiliath—a once mighty Gondorian city. Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge, and the west Osgiliath has fallen into disrepair, but the desolation of east Osgiliath is more pronounced—it is held by the forces of Mordor. The camera tracks down beneath the bridge to the dark waters, catching a stealthy movement. Many boats carrying murderous-looking orcs are quietly tracking down the river, with several hunched figures on board steering with long oars. Faramir, Captain of Gondor, issues orders to his soldiers. The Ithilien Rangers take position; they are all weathered, hardened, professional soldiers, watchful, ready, and waiting. On the river, the boats quietly advance, and Faramir and his soldiers lie in wait. As the boats arrive, hundreds of orcs race ashore, and Faramir steps out, his sword drawn. A fierce battle ensues, but Faramir is unable to stop the advance as hundreds of orcs cross the wide bridge into west Osgiliath. A dizzying view looks down on Minas Tirith, 1000 feet below, as Pippin desperately scrambles up the rocky mountainside, clambers over a rocky ledge, and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily. An ancient stone ledge holds a great pile of firewood, secured in stacked bundles. Gandalf waits tensely below as Pippin stealthily manages to pour oil on the wood and set a flame to it. Within seconds, the great pyre is alight, and the guards look on in total surprise as the flames erupt into the twilight sky.",
    "175": "The Black Guy has his I.D. folder open as Ray Bones then walks off, and we see coming out a different gate, two big guys in sunglasses flanking one smaller, older guy. He looks over his shoulder to give the guy a smile. The agents glance at each other without giving any kind of sign. He straightens up as Chili exits the stairwell and walks up to him. Chili looks at him, the guy's either dumb or making conversation. The Bear keeps staring but doesn't say anything. The Bear looks at him. The Bear nods, closing and opening his eyes. Harry, his hair a mess from sleeping on it, looks up at the door as it opens to reveal Ray Bones standing there. He jerks upright. Harry wakes up quick, nearly wets himself as Bones then casually steps into the office. Scrambling now to play it the way Chili taught him, Harry quickly gestures to the red leather chair across the desk. As Ray Bones sits down, Harry moves to the blinds and opens them. Problem is, the sun's setting, so there's no glare at all. Ray indicates the nice red sunset. Harry just smiles, sits down at the desk, things already not going too well, about to get worse. Bo Catlett is behind a big wooden desk on the phone. The Bear, sort of half doubled over, sees three dark-shaded gentlemen step out of the car. Bo Catlett looks into the outer office as a car pulls into the garage. Bo Catlett hangs up, gets to his feet as the men all look into the office now. We can now see that one of the Latinos is older, the other two, younger, are his bodyguards. Mr. Escobar, the older, meaner one, steps into the office. As the two back doors of a limo slam shut, Bo Catlett sits in the back, wedged in between the two bodyguards, neither of whom has removed his shades. He faces Escobar on the opposite seat. Escobar studies him a moment. Bo Catlett stiffens. Bo Catlett shrugs. Bo Catlett barely glances at the bodyguards, smiles the gleamy smile to the Latin guy in front of him. As Ronnie zigzags in and out of traffic, giving people 'the look' as he passes, he is on the carphone. Bo Catlett is on the phone. Bones leans forward; Ray's heard that one before. Bones shakes his head, stands up, and begins kicking the living shit out of Harry Zimm. Ray Bones pulls a pair of black leather gloves from his pocket and steps around the desk. Bones grabs him by the hair, picks him up, and throws him across the room into the wall of pictures, many of them coming off their hooks and falling on top of Harry.",
    "981": "They put down their bags, and Benjamin peers into the kitchen, then down the narrow flight of steps to Queenie's basement bedroom, as Daisy watches him walk to the foot of the stairs. An elderly woman appears on the landing. A mostly black congregation has gathered for the funeral in a quaint white church, with Queenie's daughter wearing a black veil and a man in a suit nodding solemnly beside her. Daisy and Benjamin sit at the end of the pew closest to the wall, watching as people grieve openly. Queenie lies at the front in an open casket. The man shakes Benjamin's hand and moves along, while Daisy lowers her eyes as Benjamin stares ahead serenely. People begin to rise from the pews, and the framed family photograph is on the wall. Daisy turns on a bathroom tap, but no water comes out. Naked and wrapped in a bed sheet, Daisy hurries into the bathroom as Benjamin takes delivery at the fridge freezer. Fully dressed, they decorate the house, and Benjamin paints Daisy's bottom with a pink roller, prompting her to chase him with a brush. Night falls, and they dance and twist on the mattress in the lamp-lit bedroom. Benjamin removes his T-shirt, they kiss, and he lies on top of her. Benjamin hangs a picture and makes popcorn as they watch The Beatles on a black and white television. A woman performs physiotherapy on Daisy's leg, and Daisy surfaces at the edge of a swimming pool, watching as a young woman dives in and swims front crawl. Wearing a white shirt, Benjamin appears poolside and observes as the woman swims effortlessly and climbs from the pool, while Daisy watches her with sad eyes. Sobbing, Daisy rests her arms on the poolside and lulls her head as daylight spills in through the tall windows and Benjamin strolls calmly to the water's edge. Daisy's head is buried in the crook of her arm. Wearing a headscarf, Daisy rides with Benjamin down a winding road on his motorcycle. Lightning crackles in the gloomy sky as they ride alongside. Wearing a patchwork blanket around his shoulders and carrying two mugs, Benjamin walks up from behind the parked motorbike, strolls past the lake house to the boardwalk, and sits beside Daisy by the wooden railings as she stares down the length at the derelict jetty and the lake beyond. He hands her a drink, and they're cast in a warm glow as the sun rises. Daisy breezes through a dance studio as young girls file out. She locks up and deposits her keys by a desk, while tall studio mirrors run the length of the wall opposite the front windows. Daisy strolls across the varnished wooden floorboard and regards her reflection as she poses with one arm elevated.",

A boarding officer spots Uri struggling and runs to help. From the platform, Uri has hoisted Alec onto the rising ark, but Alec can't reach him, so with all his might, Uri grabs Alec's legs and hurls him into the air before plunging into the pit and falling. Two boarding officers drag the protesting boy onboard. Meanwhile, the coms officer spots a hydraulic malfunction preventing the gate from closing, and Adriane spots Lily and Noah on the monitor as dark, battling floodwaters wipe out the airfield and the mountains. On the ark bridge, the Ark office leads Adrian and Laura through the crowded hallway, and the crew watch awestruck as the floodwater clears the surrounding mountains. The clock counts down from 10 seconds as the water draws near and hits the ark from a high end. Anheuser glowers as the countdown tower hits zero, lights go off as water crashes over the ark, and the crew are knocked over on the bridge. The boarding officers and Uri's boys hurry away as water crashes in around them, and water slams through a corridor, knocking people over. The crew re-man their controls, and in the flooded corridor, Nina tends to Tenzen, who has injured his leg. A door slams shut on Lily and Tamara, and Tamara gets Lily and Caesar free, trapping herself in a flooding corridor. On the bridge, Anheuser spots a wrecked plane hovering through the crashing waves. The huge jet barges on the water, they hit, and the plane cracks the anchor away as the ark rises with massive waves curling up and over the top. A computer graphic shows the angle of the collision between the two arks as the ark descends dramatically, throwing the crowds in the hallway off their feet. The ark dives headlong, and stuff crashes around in the corridor. Adrian and Laura find Lily, and on the bridge on a flat rooftop, they watch a computer image of Mount Everest. Down in the geological bay connecting corridor, Jackson, Kate, Noah, and Tibetans hear all this over the speaker. Up to his waist in the water, Jackson walks away from the others as Noah stares long and steadily at his father. Jackson kisses Noah, and before Kate takes the boy away, he kisses her too. In flickering light, he turns around and takes a deep breath. Nina flashes a torchlight and screams for help, as does Tamara in the anti-chamber. Tamara's face is pressed up against the grate as the water level rises and covers her. Jackson swims into the hydraulic chamber and surfaces in an air pocket, while Kate tries to treat the injured Tenzen.",
    "876": "A photograph of Christine with baby Zoe is followed by another showing a smiling Christine next to a birthday cake, a photo of Zoe with a teddy bear, and a photo of Christine and Kate with their arms around each other, both grinning happily at the camera, alongside recent photos of Zoe. After closing the album and placing it on the chest of drawers, Kate turns off a lamp and makes her way slowly around the bed, where she sits down on the edge and looks down wistfully. The next morning, Zoe stands by the bed looking down at Kate, who's fast asleep, and sleepy Kate opens her eyes and looks at the clock. Zoe is in her room, staring at her, and Kate sighs resignedly before searching through a cardboard box in Zoe's room, pulling out a scarf that Zoe shakes her head at, then finding another one, only for Zoe to shake her head again. Kate puts the pink, stripy scarf back and begins to look through a second box as Zoe follows her into the hallway. Kate picks up her keys, grabs her coat, and Zoe stands and stares at the door until Kate walks back to her. Zoe, wearing a red woolen hat and multicolored scarf, gives a brief nod, then looks away. Kate comes back with coffee as scores of children make their way towards a large, brown brick building. Kate and Zoe walk along the street and stop by the side of a yellow school bus parked outside, then inside the school, they walk down a corridor decorated with children's drawings. Ellen takes Zoe's hand and leads her away, leaving Kate with her therapist, where she lies back on the couch incredulously. After school, a gaggle of schoolchildren run down the steps of Zoe's school, and Kate stands with other parents and guardians on the pavement outside, smiling as she sees Zoe walking out on her own. The two of them walk along the street together, then at home, Zoe is at the table as Kate takes her plate to it. Later, Kate hurries to the front door and sees a teenager with a nose piercing, looks the young goth up and down, and as Zoe walks past, Kate turns back to Charlotte, smiling awkwardly at the sulky young woman who steps into the apartment, and Kate closes the door behind her before walking off towards Zoe's room and nodding slowly, then sharing a look with Zoe. At the restaurant, in the kitchen, Leah is with Nick as Kate walks past them and turns off the CD player. Nick looks up, and Kate bristles while the staff sit around a table, and Nick dishes up spaghetti, passing a plate along to Kate. Handsome, shaggy-haired Nick stares at Kate, a little put out.",
    "1028": "A wave crashes against a rock in a bay as bright sunlight shines through clouds. Mountains give way to dense trees, above which a bell tower rises. Fluffy white clouds float in a blue sky, and below lies the ever-changing landscape of the United States of America, including lush mountains, densely packed cities, and vast patchworks of fields. The screen splits to show more aerial views: a coastal city, a freeway cutting across lush parkland, a meandering river, and circular fields spread across the land, with snow-capped mountains and a jagged, rocky coastline. A jet comes in to land on the runway. Meanwhile, a thick-set man in a suit, Steve, clears a table, shreds documents, pours bleach in a coffee jar, and aims a rifle at the office. Ryan Bingham, a suavely seated man in his late 40s with neat graying hair and a side parting, interacts with Steve, who hands over his key card at the door. In a hotel room, Ryan packs a suitcase with military precision, studies a pouch full of ties, closes it, and puts it in the case. He zips up the suitcase, pulls out its handle, drags it out of the room, and switches off the light as he goes. At an airport, Ryan drops off a rental car and walks up to the First Class priority access desk, grabs his boarding pass, and shows it to a security guard. He puts his case on a table, grabs two gray plastic trays, and places his laptop, shoes, and suit jacket into them. He steps through the walk-through metal detector, holding up his boarding pass, and passes the security check. Ryan puts his jacket and shoes back on, zips up his case, pulls out the handle, and walks off with it. A jet flies above a blanket of fluffy white clouds, and Ryan sits in First Class, watching a flight attendant walk down the aisle pushing a trolley. She hands a passenger a drink, Ryan looks up at her, frowning, and she places the can of soda back on the trolley before walking on. Ryan smiles. The jet comes in to land, and Ryan unzips a backpack and stands behind a lectern, smiling at a few delegates seated at long tables. At the airport, Ryan walks up to a desk with a sign beside it, shows a card, then drags his case into a lounge where he sits in a leather armchair, looks at a piece of paper, and makes a phone call, after which he looks surprised. Dallas at night displays a vast city of lights as an American Airlines jet taxis at the airport.",
    "515": "The flashback ends. Mickey is back in the present in his darkened living room, illuminated by a glow from a window behind the couch. A coffee table sits in front of the couch, and papers are scattered on the floor. Mickey gets up from the couch where he'd been sitting and paces back and forth as he talks over the screen. Manon Lescaut is being performed. Onstage, the soprano in the title role sings a mournful aria as she kneels by the ruins of a wagon; the background is dark. The film moves up to the private boxes in the upper loge, where David and Holly can be seen from a distance sitting in one of the boxes. David glances at her; he reaches down for a bottle of wine. The movie briefly cuts back to the stage, where the soprano is leaning on a wagon wheel; her voice soars. Then it's back to a closer look at Holly and David in their box. The aria continues as David hands a smiling Holly a glass. He uncorks the wine and pours some in both their glasses. Holly mouths a thank you, glancing around. They look at each other and raise their glasses in a toast. Lee, wearing a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, has opened the door for Elliot and his client, wealthy rock star Dusty Frye. Lee closes the door behind the men and walks over to Dusty. Lee chuckles as she looks at him; he is wearing sunglasses, a red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat. She turns and walks with Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty farther into the loft, her hands clasped behind her back. Frederick covers his face to hide his disgust. As Dusty talks, the camera follows Elliot, who walks past the others to examine the drawings more closely. Two framed nude drawings of Lee are propped up on an easel. Elliot glances admiringly at the drawings, then surreptitiously at Lee, admiring her body as she converses with an offscreen Dusty and Frederick. The camera leaves Elliot to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts leading him to the door. Frederick follows at a distance. The camera now moves back to Elliot, still staring at the nude drawings, as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps are heard leaving the loft. He turns and hesitantly smiles to an offscreen Lee. He laughs. Lee, uneasy, looks down. There's an awkward moment of silence. The camera follows Lee as she walks quickly to the stereo unit, pulling a record off the shelf. She pulls the record out of its jacket and puts it on the turntable. The record in place, Lee turns and leans back against the stereo unit.",
    "1034": "Natalie spins around and heads off. Ryan looks out of the window of a jet as it rises into the sky. In Las Vegas, Alex holds the cut-out of Julie and Jim in front of the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel. Ryan aims the digital camera, and Alex moves the cut-out closer. He takes a picture while Alex stares at the cut-out. Ryan smiles, and Alex looks surprised before smiling warmly. In Milwaukee, a jet comes in to land. Alex and Ryan walk through the airport terminal, with him pulling a black wheelie case and her a similar, neat red one. Later, they walk into the Chalet Suites, a Swiss lodge-themed hotel, and join a short queue of people checking in. Ryan notices a second counter with no queue. As Ryan opens a hotel room door, his sister Kara walks up holding a basket of washing. Alex and Ryan walk into their gaudily furnished room, where Ryan picks up a photocopied booklet with a picture of Julie and Jim on the front. Julie hugs Ryan, and Jim comes over. There's a large map of the U.S. on the wall, pinned with several photos of the cut-out of Julie and Jim in front of famous landmarks. Ryan steps back and looks at the map, covered in photographs, smiles thoughtfully, and goes back to join Alex, Julie, and Jim, pointing at the map. Later, at the bar, Alex goes back in while Ryan waits outside with Julie and Kara. They smile, and Julie nods and looks down sadly as Kara looks at her, with a box of flower arrangements nearby. Ryan drives up to his old school with Alex, and they get out of the car, looking at the long, low building. They tramp across some snow and walk up to the entrance. Ryan tries the door, finding it locked, and peers inside to see darkness. He turns to Alex resignedly, but she grins and goes to a window, undoes a catch with a credit card, and pulls it open. He grabs her foot and heaves her up, and they both clamber into a classroom, where they look at old newspaper photos of the basketball team and a picture in a trophy case. Outside by a loading bay, they sit on the stairs and kiss. In the gym, they watch the basketball team practice and grin at each other. Kara calls, so Alex drops Ryan off by the church. Ryan runs up to the church entrance, opens the door, and runs up some stairs. He walks into the church and finds Julie, in white, sitting with her bridesmaids, who wear cerise, crying. They see Ryan, and Kara goes over to him as he looks at Julie, who wipes tears from her eyes.",
    "739": "A crescent moon drifting amid clouds is reflected in still water, and a fisherman's float plops onto the surface, creating a ring around it. On the curve of the crescent moon, a boy lounges with his fishing rod. A somber-looking black woman in her 40s turns to face the camera and puts aside a cooking pot. The maid nods with a smile and a long, penetrating gaze, but the smile vanishes as her eyes move across the room, settling on a framed photo of a young, black, graduate student on the facing wall, after which she looks away. She lifts the baby out of her cot and wraps her arms around the little girl. In a wig and a pale, blue and white uniform, she walks to the bus stop and pats the child's tummy. The hem looks uneven. Meanwhile, a young redhead at the wheel of a blue convertible 1962 Cadillac speeds along a dirt track bisecting a wide field, with clouds of dust trailing behind her. Ring lettered Skeeter drives along with a look of determined optimism, then pulls in at a gas station and waits as a black attendant cleans her windscreen. A flag flutters on the roof of the substantial offices of the Jackson Journal, where down in the street, Skeeter pulls up outside the main entrance and strides confidently through the glass-fronted door. A cigarette smoking receptionist leads the way through the sprawling open plan office to the editor's office, where a short, middle-aged man is dwarfed by his big desk and he points to Skeeter. Eugenia Phelan, AKA Skeeter, hands over her resume as he stretches for a folder. Skeeter, carrying a basket of readers' letters, comes out of Blackly's office with a happy smile. At her home, a well-groomed brunette in a flowery, sleeveless, '60s style dress pulls out a length of toilet paper and marks it with dots. Minnie, a stout, well-cushioned maid, trots to the bottom of the stairs and shouts up, then, carrying a pie, follows the ladies to their car. Aibileen Clark, the narrator, is garnishing a dish with grapes, while Elizabeth Leefolt looks through her front curtains and then nods to Aibileen, who slides the chicken dish over a crack in the veneer of the dining table. In the bathroom, she squats in front of moon-faced Mae Mobley, who's sitting on a child's toilet seat, and Elizabeth scoops up her daughter. Hilly sashays into the sitting room and beams at her girlfriends. Minnie joins Aibileen in the kitchen and makes a beeline for a dish of deviled eggs, bites into an egg, and then picks up a tray and a TV set, which she carries off towards the lounge as Aibileen picks up the cord that Minnie is trailing behind her.",
    "919": "A lion's head looks out from a crest formed by a garland of film, Metro-Goldman-Mayer, which features the words. Light flares from a torch held aloft by a robed woman standing on a pedestal in front of a sky dominated by towering clouds. Towering crags rise out of a shining sea. Two powerful cars speed along a tunnel which runs along the coast. A shiny wheel flashes, a driver's eyes are fixed on the road. A gun is caught, the driver checks his rear view mirror. He guns his shiny Aston-Martin past a line of traffic as his pursuers open up. Bullet holes pepper the Aston's windows. The tire on a truck bursts and gets swerved into the Aston's path sliding along the wall as James Bond, the steely-eyed Aston driver brakes hard. He swerves past the truck which pulls out on him. A piece of metal protruding at the front of the truck, punches into the car's door, locking the two vehicles together. Bond brakes hard causing the metal to rip his door open sending the Aston spinning down the road in front of the truck. He regains control and speeds off. The two lanes ahead are blocked. One coming right for him. He locks into a gap. But his pursuers hit the truck head on. Another Alfa Romeo is still in the chase. Approaching a traffic jam he swerves left, flying down another tunnel to chase a track's vision off. The Aston-Martin followed by the black Alfa-Romeo driving towards the quarry. The cops glimpse the cars speed over a bridge. The Land Rover heads off, blue lights flashing. Coming out of the tunnel and rounding a corner, Bond skids the car to avoid the police Land Rover which blocks the road in front of him and heads off through the dusty quarry, the Alfa still on his tail. He swerves past tracked excavators and down a winding bumpy track in front of a smooth new quarry rock face. The cops open fire and get blasted from the Alfa. The Land Rover plows into a building and off the edge of a cliff. Bond calmly changes gear. His eyes widen as the Land Rover bounces across the track right in front of him. The Alfa gunman is leaning out of the car's passenger window. Bond ducks as glass and bullets fill the Aston. The Alfa draws alongside and the two cars trade dusty paintwork. A bulldozer looms in front of them. Both cars swerve round it. Bond draws a machine-gun. The Alfa hurtles off a precipice. Bond drives the dusty battered Aston into a medieval Italian town with stone buildings and narrow streets. A lofty campanile bell tower dominates the huddle of buildings.",
    "1246": "Miranda strides through the foyer and approaches a lift while a staff member waits for another lift. She pulls off her designer shades as Emily runs to meet her. Emily fetches Andy, who's holding her resume, and snatches Andy's briefcase. Andy walks nervously into the bright, airy office, which has black-and-white framed photos on the wall. Miranda takes in Andy's attire while reading a magazine. Andy frowns and heads for the door, then turns back as Miranda turns her attention to black-clad Nigel. Andy hands her pass in at the reception desk on the ground floor and is heading for the doors when Emily appears and beckons. Andy dines with Nate and two mates and is in bed when her phone goes off at 6:15. Andy hurries down the street with four coffees as two women wheel a clothes rail into Miranda's office. She comes out, and Emily calls Andy when she walks in. Andy watches Emily carry the coffees into Miranda's office, then hangs up her coat and hurries to her desk, which faces Emily's. Andy is wearing a bright blue jumper while Emily inputs a message. Nigel has given Andy black stilettos, and Andy hurries in as Miranda stiffens. Miranda's eyes travel down Andy's body, taking in her plaid skirt, black tights, and fixing on her sensible, black flat shoes. Andy scurries back to her desk and quickly dons the black stilettos that Nigel brought her as Emily takes over. Miranda rolls her eyes, and Andy is hurt by the slight. A sleek chauffeur-driven car brings Andy to the Calvin Klein showroom on 7th Avenue, and her mobile phone rings as she's getting out. She crosses in heavy traffic and struggles back into the office, carrying big bags and four coffees. Miranda waltzes in and drops her coat and bag onto Andy's desk as willowy, well-dressed Serena walks off with Emily. Later, Andy goes down to the canteen, where shaven-headed Nigel finds her helping herself to some soup. They exchange a smile as Andy gets a roll and then gets soup on her jumper. A gentleman is in the lift with them as Miranda vets outfits and inspects a dress. Andy chuckles at the similarity of the two blue belts, but her smile fades. At home, Nate hands her a sandwich. Andy is at her desk dumping her coat and bag, and Andrea turns with boards. A dog is there as Andy does her bidding, and Emily goes. Andy and her father have dinner together, and she accepts the cash as they go to the theater. Back at the office, holding back her tears, Andy walks out of Miranda's office into the anteroom and past Emily's desk. Andy walks through the editorial department and passes Nigel's office, which has a glass wall. She stops by the door and looks in at Nigel, who is examining some contact sheets on an illuminated desktop.",
    "237": "He smiles and runs to catch up with his family. He looks back, but Dorota is lost to sight and the procession continues on its way. Two rooms on the third floor: a living room and a kitchen. The Szpilmans are unpacking their belongings in silence. Father pauses for a moment to take stock. They all go to the window and look out. Their POV - the street. Further along, men are building a wall across the street. Slush underfoot. Great activity. People selling shoes, clothes, carpets, curtains, food. A woman offers cakes under a barbed-wire cover. Noise, bustle, restless wing and froing. Among the traders, Henryk, slightly shabbier now, and at his feet a basket with books. He holds a couple of volumes in his hands, trying to interest passers-by. Szpilman, also a little shabbier, wends his way through the setters and buyers, the beggars, the passers-by, and reaches Henryk. Henryk drops the two volumes into the basket, takes a handle one side of the basket, Szpilman the other. They set off. As they walk, carrying the basket between them, passing beggars and children asking for food. Suddenly, a WOMAN appears in front of them, barring their way. She's brightly rouged with thickly painted eyebrows, dressed in an old green velvet curtain with an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. She wanders on. Szpilman and Henryk, too, continue on their way. And as they go. Meanwhile, a street band begins to play a waltz. Jewish policemen and German soldiers are clearing a space, shoving Jews out of the way, including Szpilman, Henryk and the nervous man. Other soldiers are clearing a space. Two GERMAN SOLDIERS pull out of the crowd a tall woman and a short man and haul them into the cleared space. The couple dance to the street band's waltz. At intervals, German soldiers select even more unlikely couples: a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy with an elderly woman, two men, and two cripples. The German soldiers are, to various degrees, amused. One of them is almost hysterical with laughter. The couples dance as fast as they can. A soldier kicks one of the cripples who can't go on any more. Then a whistle blows, a policeman stops the traffic, the barrier swings open and people swarm across in both directions. Szpilman and Henryk enter and stop. Seated at the table with Mother and Father is a uniformed young man, YITZCHAK HELLER, unusual appearance, a man with red hair and a Hitler moustache. Heller remains seated, just nods at the brothers. Awkward silence. He runs dry. Benek points to the customer, who makes an imploring gesture to Szpilman. Szpilman stops playing.",

Mr. Bennet leaves the letter on the desk until the housekeeper has left. The housekeeper now makes her way out into the garden to take down the washing. Jane and Lizzie are picking fruit. Lizzie puts down her basket and rushes off, quickly followed by Jane. The two girls hurry around the outside of the house, then across the wide expanse of lawn, looking for their father. They spot him, arms behind his back, strolling pensively into the shade of the trees. They rush over to him. Lizzie sits down with the letter. Lizzie stands up, looking perturbed. Later, Lizzie's in Jane's bedroom in her nightgown. Jane sits by the fire, drying her hair. Lizzie sits sadly on the stool at the foot of Jane's bed. Mr. Darcy's expression is one of determined constancy. A lady's hand at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Lizzie stands and leaves. With a heavy heart, Lizzie makes her way over to her father's study. She pauses to watch him through the doorway and slowly goes inside. He turns round and takes her hand. Two of them listen to Mrs. Bennet's hysterical chatter. Lizzie does so. A building fronted by magnificent pillared portico. An open-topped carriage pulls up, drawn by two white horses. Lydia gets out, dressed in a simple, empire line wedding dress and bonnet, and carrying a bunch of flowers. The Gardiners are with her. Beaming, she takes Mr. Gardiner's hand and heads up the steps. Inside, Mr. Wickham stands up, ready to receive his bride. Mr. Darcy appears beside him, his face taut with anger. Lydia walks down the aisle, grinning, and takes her place beside Mr. Wickham at the altar. The vicar comes to stand before them. An open-topped carriage trundles down the long driveway at Longbourn. Mr. and Mrs. Wickham are sitting in the back. The Bennet family come out to greet them. Mrs. Bennet waving a white handkerchief excitedly above her head. Mrs. Bennet takes her husband's arm and leads the way. Jane makes to follow them. Jane and Lizzie exchange glances, then head inside, followed by Mary and Kitty. Later, the girls are out walking. Mr. Wickham is showing off his riding skills nearby. Wickham canters past them and makes his horse jump over a log. Wickham rides past them again, and Lydia grins cheekily at her sisters. Lizzie looks thoughtful. Mr. Gardiner proffers his hand, and the deal is done. Wickham finds Lizzie reading the letter. She looks away, embarrassed. They walk together in the gardens of Longbourn.",
    "1146": "Harry runs to Cedric and helps him to free himself, and exhausted and trembling, he scrambles to his feet as a strong wind flings leaves high into the air and the hedges advance. As the hedges close in behind them, they both sprint towards the shining trophy, and upon reaching it, they pause in front of it and grab it, one hand each. It spins like a Catherine wheel, and they land beside a statue in the cemetery, scrambling to their feet as Cedric looks around the moonlit graveyard. The trophy is lying on the ground, and Harry clutches his forehead in agony. Wormtail appears, clutching a small, wizened creature in a blanket, and Cedric draws his wand but falls dead. Aiming his wand, Wormtail forces Harry up into the arms of the statue, which traps him fast behind the handle of the scythe. A cauldron stands in front of Harry as Wormtail drops the pale, deformed creature into it, opens the Riddle family grave, drops a bone into the cauldron, draws a knife, slices off his right hand into the cauldron, slashes open Harry's sleeve, and cuts Harry's arm, adding Harry's blood to the cauldron. The contents of the cauldron sieve and bubble, and Wormtail runs into the shadows as flames leap high into the night sky. The cauldron disappears as a ghastly, shapeless figure appears in front of Harry, writhing and twisting as it slowly takes human form. A veil of black smoke descends and unfolds the creature as Voldemort slowly turns his head, his gleaming, gray skin stretched tight over his bony features, with sunken eyes, and in place of a nose, two narrow slits for nostrils. He runs his fingers over his hairless skull as Wormtail emerges from the shadows, and now, draped in a black robe, Voldemort opens his arms triumphantly, admiring his restored human form with a smile on his thin lips. Bowing low, Wormtail holds it out, and Voldemort takes it in his long, bony fingers, pressing his wand into the dark mark tattooed on Wormtail's arm. He looks up into the glowering sky, and from the darkening clouds, a snaking ribbon of black smoke emerges, twisting and turning downwards, dividing into separate plumes, each revealing a black-robed death eater wearing a tall pointed hood and a skeleton mask. As the smoke clears, Voldemort faces them, unmasks them, and they fall to their knees. Snatching another mask, Lucius rips off his hood and restores his hand in silver, looking down at Cedric. He presses one finger into Harry's scarred forehead, causing Harry to fall to the ground, forcing him to bow and writhe in agony. He sends Harry spinning, but Harry dives for cover, summoning up every ounce of courage to face Voldemort.",
    "1048": "Sam spots Howard with his camera and narrows his eyes, furrowing his brow pensively before making his way over to Howard. Meanwhile, Javier stands in the elevator, staring at a CCTV camera, and reaches the fourth floor where he strolls down a corridor, slots a swipe card into a machine on a hotel room door, and unlocks it. Inside, he removes a hold-all from a fridge, takes a pistol from it, loads the pistol, and puts an earpiece in. In the plaza, Sam sees Veronica take the bag from Enrique and glances up at a marksman. Howard talks with Anna, and Sam watches Enrique depart before disappearing into the crowd. Wearing a backpack, Javier screws a silencer onto his pistol as he climbs a flight of steps in the hotel and uses a touchscreen PDA to activate the fan in the window overlooking the plaza, causing the curtain to flutter, which Barnes sees. Sam turns his back and walks away, while Javier stalks through the hotel corridors with his pistol drawn, shoots a hotel maid, and a gun falls from her hand. He goes to use the key card at a room door and gently pushes on his earpiece. In the crowd, Sam fiddles with his phone as he walks, and a receiver bleeps in a high window, with a rifle rotating on a motorized tripod. The view from the sight is relayed to Sam's phone, and he uses the wand to train the rifle on Ashton's double, tapping the screen as the double steps up to the podium with his arm outstretched. The gun fires, shooting Ashton's double, causing the crowd to disperse, and Taylor squats over Ashton's double. Javier shoots uniformed security guards in the hotel's CCTV control room, unplugs a laptop, and makes a call on his cell phone, while Sam enters the digits into his phone. Javier slips a cartridge into the pistol and removes his beige jacket. Barnes speaks into his radio. Felipe stands at his open locker, caresses a family photograph from the inside of the locker door, then shuts it. Sam approaches a parked ambulance, while Felipe stares at himself in a mirror, with dynamite strapped around his waist. He closes his bellboy's jacket over it and anxiously makes his way into a hotel corridor. Sam loads a pistol and offers it to Veronica, who is dressing herself in a nurse's uniform, and she takes it. Javier's brother, the man from Veronica's phone, sits against a white pillow with gaffer tape over his mouth, and Veronica aims the pistol at him. Sam shoots him, startling Veronica. Javier runs up a stairwell in the hotel and checks his watch, while Felipe crosses the busy hotel lobby. In a garage, Sam taps the screen of his cell phone with a stylus.",
    "300": "Produces two glasses and holds them up, puts the glasses on the table, uncovers the wine, and begins screwing in the corkscrew. Carl comes out of the kitchen carrying the empty warming oven, sets it down, and sees Lisa struggling with the corkscrew. Carl, without looking at the money, puts it in his pocket, picks up the warming oven, and she breaks off with a little laugh and a slight reproachful look at Jeff. She sips her drink, then says, and puts down her glass, sliding along the window seat nearer to him, as the camera closes in. She looks up at him with serious frankness, and Jeff's opinion is a short chuckle. Jeff gives a sigh of relief, exhaling his breath, then looks down toward his legs in thought. She moves away behind him into the kitchen. He holds this attitude for just a moment, then seems to shake off his concern to lift his head and turn his attention to what might be happening in his neighborhood beyond his window. Her apartment is below that of the salesman with the invalid wife, and Jeff's attention is concentrated on an apartment we have not seen before. At the moment, she is putting on her make-up in front of the bedroom mirror, and this belongs to a single woman, about forty years of age, who lives alone. She is quite flat-chested, and the dress hangs unattractively, as if she's preparing to meet someone. Jeff leans forward with increased interest, and behind him, Lisa is laying a cloth over the card table. A nearer view shows a more intimate picture of the woman Jeff is concentrating on, as the camera pans slightly to the woman's living room window. The spinster sweeps into the room, smiling, and a small, candle-lit table is set up with dinner for two. She is thin and unattractive, goes to the door, opens it, and admits an imaginary caller in pantomime, pretends to kiss him lightly, takes his hat, and places it on a chair. Then she shows him to a seat at the table, disappears into an unseen kitchen, and returns with a bottle and two glasses. She sits down, pours two drinks, and lifts her drink in a toast to the imaginary man opposite her. Jeff gives a faint, sympathetic smile and subconsciously raises his glass in response. Without taking his eyes from the scene, Jeff picks up his wineglass and drinks. As he drinks, his eyes move slightly over, and she starts to take a sip, smiling across the table at her imaginary guest. The smile fades from her face as her head drops, and she lowers the glass onto the table.",
    "398": "The movie begins with an outline of a woman, followed by Jude and Maguire sitting in a car parked across the street as they look toward a paper seller. Meanwhile, Fergus pulls furiously at his bindings and then drives off. Exhausted, Fergus collapses back on the bed while Maguire's car circles around once more. Fergus strains and roars from the bed as Maguire observes the brothel door opening and sees the elderly judge coming out. The judge’s car, occupied by his security men, accelerates toward him. Maguire grabs something from a woman's pocket, throws open the door, and runs across the street. As Fergus continues to pull at his bindings, the judge walks toward his car, assisted by his goon holding the door open. Maguire advances with a gun in hand, prompting the goon to see him. Maguire shoots while running, causing the judge to fall. The goon, hit in the arm, draws an Uzi and returns fire. Maguire is hit but continues shooting, while other goons rush from the car, causing mayhem and screaming. Jude steps on her car's pedal and screeches away, leaving Maguire dead. The scene shifts to Dil dressed in a soldier's cricket clothes, appearing like a sweet little boy, as she approaches Fergus in bed and points a gun at his head. She begins to cry, gently places the gun on his chest, and pulls on his bindings to free him. Two police cars, sirens wailing, pass by as Dil's face is close to Fergus's, with the stockings that bound his hands nearly undone. His arm is freed, and he strokes her hair as she shudders with weeping, accompanied by the music of a song playing in the background. Jude enters through the open door, arms extended and holding a gun, prompting Dil to rise from the bed and aim her gun at Jude. Dil fires and hits Jude, who falls and writhes on the floor. As Dil walks closer, Jude reaches for her gun, grabs it, but Dil shoots again like a child playing with a toy, hitting Jude in her gun shoulder. Jude spins one way, her gun the other, leading Fergus to scream. As Jude raises her gun, Dil shoots repeatedly, causing Fergus to scream again from the bed as he rips free his other arm. Dil shoots Jude in the throat, killing her amidst a cover of blood. Dil then turns the gun on Fergus, squeezing the trigger, but she stops and looks at a picture, walks over, and sits in front of it. She places the gun in her mouth, but Fergus gently removes it and sets it on the table. He lifts her by the shoulders and guides her out the door. Fergus returns to the room, passing Jude's body, and looks out the window to see Dil staggering down the street through the gathering crowd.",
    "100": "Lt. Dan pushes Forrest away, and Forrest steps back as Lt. Dan flips back over, then pulls himself back up onto his wheelchair and breathes heavily. An anchorman reports in front of the White House. Forrest looks at the fat man on the bus bench. President Nixon holds the plaque, and Forrest speaks on the phone, then hangs up. President Nixon makes a resignation speech on TV, and the television cuts to a shot of President Nixon standing outside Air Force One with his hands in the peace sign. An officer hands Forrest an envelope and then walks away. Forrest takes his paddle and runs out of the gymnasium. Mrs. Gump walks out of the house and smiles as Forrest walks up to the house, wearing his uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk into the house, where there are stacks of ping-pong paddles and life-sized cardboard cutouts of Forrest playing ping-pong. Forrest walks up to a shack on the edge of the Bayou as a group of black kids play in the front yard. Bubba's mother, Mrs. Blue, and her other children look at Forrest as he steps over to Bubba's tombstone and pulls out notes from his pocket, then walks along a wooden pier. Forrest pays an old black shrimper a large wad of cash and stands at the grave before steering his shrimping boat. The boat is old and rusty as Forrest unleashes his nets, and his catch of the day drops to the deck, which consists of a bunch of garbage and shells. Forrest picks up one shrimp and pulls a couple of shrimp out of a bucket. The old shrimper begins to walk away, then stops and looks at Forrest as he paints a name on the side of his boat. Disco lights flash, and people dance while a guy asks a girl to dance. Forrest stands at the helm as the boat glides across the water. Drug paraphernalia and a large wad of cash are spread out on a table as a man drops a syringe on the table and reaches over to touch Jenny, who is pale with dark lines under her eyes. Jenny smears some lines of cocaine on a mirror and looks at herself in the mirror, then steps out onto the high-rise balcony and steps up on a table to stand on the edge of the balcony. A busy street lies many stories below as Jenny looks down to the intersection, then slips over the edge. She regains her balance, turns and looks back at the intersection below, and begins to get down from the edge. Jenny grabs a hold of the ledge and carefully climbs down, then sits down on a chair and rocks back and forth as she cries.",
    "1299": "Graham smiles, and the two of them turn back to the silent screen of the television. Merrill's mouth opens a bit, and Graham turns back to the television with his eyes opening. Daylight fills the family room, and he is alone on the couch and alone in the room. He looks to where the television used to be, which is not there, and then moves to his feet and looks around the room. His eyes stop on an extension cord that runs from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. Graham moves to the door, opens the closet, and sees Merrill looking up. Merrill is seated on a kitchen chair with the television on a roll-away stand crammed in with him. Graham looks at the TV screen, which shows a daylight shot of Mexico City with empty skies above it. Merrill puts a finger on the screen and trails it to the bottom. Graham opens the bathroom door and steps out with wet hair, towel drying it as he moves to his bedroom window. He observes the large, green backyard with a wooden jungle gym, a single tree that shades a picnic table, and corn crops lining the back, golden and brown, six feet high, stretching beyond view. Graham stares at them quietly and listens closely. He walks into the hall and looks into the room where Morgan and Bo are seated on the edge of their bed with tin foil wrapped around their heads like helmets. Graham stares at his children, enters the room, and the children make space for him on the bed where he takes a seat between them. Morgan puts a book on his father's lap, and Graham looks for a picture on the back cover while Morgan closes the book. Graham gazes at his children with foil on their heads as Morgan puts the book on his lap again and opens it. Graham acknowledges with a nod and turns the page to see an illustration of a small, bulbous-headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan turns the page, revealing a space ship hovering over a home, shooting laser beams at it, and a picture of a house with three bodies lying dead on the front lawn, two of which are children. The children scream and cling to their father until their screams die down. Graham closes the book as the phone rings again. He gets up, steps out into the hallway, tucks the book under his arm, and picks up the phone. Through the phone, there is sudden scuffling, a chair squealing against the floor, and then the phone disconnects.",
    "860": "He sits, and she looks down as Jeep frowns and his expression hardens. He walks away, causing Charlie's face to crumple and she sobs. Wisps of cloud float past the moon. On the roof, Kyle is with Audrey, who's aiming an assault rifle, but she puts the gun down. Kyle looks away thoughtfully, and Audrey shakes her head and grins broadly. Audrey looks down thoughtfully, while inside, more lights come on and the jukebox whirs into action. On the roof, Kyle and Audrey look out into the darkness as a vehicle speeds along the freeway. Bob walks out from the kitchen. Bob, Jeep, and Charlie go to the window and peer out through the blinds. Audrey and Kyle watch the vehicle, a van, driving between the jumble of cars in front of the diner. Kyle gives Audrey a dark look; then Kyle aims his assault rifle and Audrey aims her pistol at the van as it stops by the pumps. A man gets out of the van and gestures to the occupants, while a child looks out of the window at the man as he grabs a gas nozzle. With his hands pressed against the window, the little boy looks up at Kyle and Audrey. Audrey runs to the side of the roof and looks out, and Kyle looks over as several cars drive out of the darkness towards the diner. Kyle stares down at the man by the van, and the boy bashes on the window. The vehicles close in, and the man drops the gas nozzle and runs to the driver's side as a car side-sweeps him, sending him flying. The car stops, and a punky-looking guy gets out. A van stops, and a rabble spills out. They surround the van, open it, and grab the boy. Kyle shoots the rabble, who surround the boy crouched on the ground. Kyle swings over the wall and jumps down from the front of the diner, running at the rabble, gun blazing. Bob starts to wrench the planks away from the windows, but turns to see Michael aiming his gun at him. Kyle barges through and picks up the boy as the rabble closes in. Kyle picks off a few of them, clutching the boy close to him as he stares out at the possessed. The boy looks at Kyle with black eyes and bites Kyle in the neck. Kyle collapses as Bob kicks a chair over. Audrey comes down from the roof and runs at the possessed, gun blazing, but when she aims at the boy and pulls the trigger, she's out of ammo. The boy stares at her with blood around his mouth. Audrey gets in the van and shuts the door as the possessed clamber on the outside. Charlie turns to Michael, who just stares at her.",
    "53": "DYLE has the large man by both lapels of the raincoat in a last-ditch effort to hold him, but SCOBIE, his face horribly distorted from the strain, continues to inch forward toward the gun. Suddenly, DYLE releases his hold, and with nothing restraining him, SCOBIE lurches forward, tumbling past the gun, his momentum carrying him onto the sloping part of the roof, where he begins sliding down. SCOBIE beats wildly at the slate with his claw, trying to gouge a grip as it slides across the slate, making a hideous scratching sound and causing sparks to fly, until he slides over the edge and disappears. As DYLE watches, hypnotized, there appears to be no sign of SCOBIE, but then the camera zooms in for a tight close shot of SCOBIE's metal hand, gripping the rain gutter at the very edge. Having seen the claw, DYLE rises and walks to the very edge of the level part of the roof, then turns and leaves going down the stairs. DYLE leaves the elevator and goes to his own door, where the MANAGER eyes him coldly. She leads him into her room, then as REGGIE and DYLE enter from his room, she leads him to the bed. She wets the cotton with disinfectant and begins cleaning the wound as he winces. She continues working on his back, cleaning it, then bandaging it while they talk. He goes to the bed and sits as she starts kissing him on the neck, on the chin, on the cheek, then on the mouth. The phone rings, and he tries to talk as she continues kissing him. The phone continues to ring and she continues to kiss him until finally, REGGIE reaches out to the bedstand and takes the phone off the hook. She brings the receiver up to their mouths and mumbles into it while TEX speaks into the phone. She covers the phone and turns to DYLE in alarm as TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and puts him down on SCOBIE's other knee. A knock at the door, GIDEON goes to open it as REGGIE and DYLE enter. She sees JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun, causing a pause as the three men look at one another unhappily. He takes DYLE's key and gives DYLE his, and GIDEON goes to REGGIE, takes her key and gives her his own. Including TEX, busy going through the bureau, who looks up, then joins GIDEON. GIDEON empties the contents of the bag on the table, then starts examining the various items, opening the wallet, then putting it aside and picking up the letter, removing it from the envelope and reading it. A broad grin from TEX as they continue going through the items from the bag.",
    "8": "They stand there in silence; the atmosphere is charged. He is sexy. She's unnerved--this is happening too fast. She's trying to be seductive as she says this, but she's pretty bad at it. His face is very close to hers. Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, her neck. And Lester kisses her on the lips. Carolyn drives, her face resolute. Angela lays back on the couch as Lester moves in over her. He pulls her jeans off and gently brushes his fingers over her legs, then moves up and caresses her face. Ricky and Jane, fully clothed, lie curled up on Jane's bed. She seems disconnected from what's happening. Lester starts unbuttoning Angela's blouse. Lester pulls her blouse open, exposing her breasts. Lester looks down at her, grinning, unable to believe he's actually about to do what he's dreamed of so many times, and then. Lester LAUGHS. Lester looks down at her, his grin fading. Angela lies beneath us, embarrassed and vulnerable. This is not the mythically carnal creature of Lester's fantasies; this is a nervous child. Lester's face falls. He grabs a blanket from the back of the couch and drapes it around her shoulders, covering her nakedness. He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela starts to cry. He hugs her, letting her put her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently. But she keeps crying. The Mercedes pulls onto Robin Hood Trail. CLOSE on Carolyn's eyes, reflected in the REAR-VIEW MIRROR. She turns her head to look out the window: The RED DOOR of the Burnham house stands out, even in the pouring rain. Angela, once again fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter. She's eating a turkey sandwich. He turns to her and cocks an eyebrow. A long beat, as Lester studies her, then. They just sit there, smiling at each other, then. She crosses off. Lester watches her go, then stands there wondering why he should suddenly feel so content. Something at the edge of the counter catches his eye, and he reaches for. Lester crosses to the kitchen table, where he sits and studies the photo. CLOSE on a framed PHOTOGRAPH as he picks it up: It's the photo we saw earlier of him, Carolyn and Jane, taken several years ago at an amusement park. It's startling how happy they look. He suddenly seems older, more mature. and then he smiles: the deep, satisfied smile of a man who just now understands the punch line of a joke he heard long ago. After a beat, the barrel of a GUN rises up behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull.",
    "590": "Whip squats and looks over the array of spirits; he settles for vodka. Still kneeling, he unscrews the top from the bottle and runs his fingers over the cold surface of the glass, bringing the bottle to his nose. He replaces the cap, then slowly stands up and sets the bottle on top of the fridge, closes the fridge door, and walks away. Whip swoops up the bottle. Charlie exits an elevator carrying three coffees, with Hugh following. Edmonds knocks, and the men look at each other as Hugh checks the time. Bottles lie everywhere, and Whip lies face down in the bathroom, a large blood stain on the toilet. Harling arrives with a bag slung over his shoulder; Hugh jumps back, and Charlie raises his hands as Harling gestures to Edmonds. Hugh clears the table, and Harling sits beside Whip, cutting the coke, while Whip smiles up at Harling with a torn piece of toilet paper, with a spot of blood, hanging over his eye. Hugh fetches the water as Harling prepares the cigarette. Whip drinks while Harling sucks on the cigarette and hands it to Whip, then cuts more lines of coke and snorts a line, offering a hit to Charlie and Hugh. Whip nods and enters the bathroom as Harling puts on his shades. Whip strides out of the room wearing sunglasses, a Band-Aid on his forehead, and dressed in a suit, with Charlie and Hugh following behind him. They enter an elevator with a woman and a little girl who stares at Whip as Hugh hands him a handkerchief. Whip tilts his head back and presses the cloth to his nostril, removes his glasses, and looks at his reflection on the elevator ceiling before lowering his gaze to the little girl. In the hearing room, cell phone footage of the plane crash is played on a large screen, ending as Whip shifts in his seat and sips some water. Ellen presses a remote, rises, walks around the table at the head of the room, and projects an image on two giant screens. Ellen faces Whip in the middle of the room, slips on her glasses, and checks her notes as Whip glances at Hugh and Charlie. The evidence appears on screen as Ellen nods and leafs through a file, and Charlie and Hugh share a glance. Whip gazes at an enlarged photograph of Katerina on the screen, rolls his tongue, and looks briefly at Hugh and Charlie before studying Katerina's smiling face with pressed lips. He takes a sip of water as Ellen nods, and Whip looks firmly at Ellen, his face shiny with perspiration. Whip looks down, his eyes heavy, as Ellen closes her file and slowly walks to her seat.",
    "691": "Hazy morning sunshine washes over the New York skyline as Peter stands on a payphone at his rundown digs. Meanwhile, at her home, Mary Jane is staring at her phone. Mary Jane picks up the phone, but Peter has rung off. Peter spins around and answers the phone. Captain Stacy puts a mugshot down in front of Aunt May, and Peter snatches it up. In a black and white flashback, Peter sees his uncle sitting in his car on a dark street, where Flint taps at the driver's window with a gun. Flint pushes Uncle Ben to the ground as his accomplice runs up, but Flint pushes him away, allowing the accomplice to jump into Uncle Ben's car. Flint shoots Uncle Ben in cold blood, causing a tear to fall from Peter's eye as he imagines the scene, and Uncle Ben slumps to the ground, dead while the accomplice drives away, leaving Flint behind. Peter flings the photo of Flint down on the desk. Later in his rundown digs, Peter taps his finger and broods as the radio fires up. Peter wrenches up the door, turns down the volume, and Mary Jane gives him a hurt, angry look, purses her lips, and goes to the door, tugging at it. Peter, his face unmasked and his eyes cold, turns up the radio and stands brooding. Later, he changes into his Spider-Man suit and stares intently at the radio on the chest of radios, beside which are photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. He leans his head morosely against the doorpost as lighting flashes and he lies on his bed, reliving the attack on his uncle. Something crawls across the floor, causing Peter to stir, raise his head, and then lie back down. The unseen presence glides across the door and onto the bed, casting a tangled black shadow on the wall. In his sleep, Peter sees Uncle Ben looking into his killer's eyes as shiny black tendrils latch onto Peter's hand. Flint shoots Ben, and the tendrils spread up Peter's arm, covering the Spider-Man suit like black ivy smothering a tree. Peter's hands grip the sheet convulsively as the alien growth spreads down his torso, and in his dream, Peter pushes Flint's accomplice out the window. The tendrils cover his face and his eyes open in horror. Peter, now with his Spider-Man suit completely black, hangs upside down from a skyscraper, looking at his reflection in a dark-mirrored window. He drops onto his feet on a ledge, takes a close look at his reflection, and clenches his fingers. He flips up the side of the building and leaps into the air, swinging from a thread, sweeping low between the line of cars and up to a high roof adorned with lanterns. He clings to one huge lantern, looks out over the city, and pulls off his black hood.",
    "1178": "Visitors scatter in all directions as the huge snake slithers along the floor and escapes to freedom out of the door of the Reptile House. Dripping wet, Dudley scrambles to his feet, but the glass window has reappeared, trapping him in the snake house. He bangs desperately on the glass as his mother screams with horror, and Uncle Vernon spots Harry laughing, glaring at him suspiciously. Back at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon grabs Harry by the hair and locks him into the cupboard under the stairs. A tawny owl flies low over Privet Drive and drops a letter, and inside Number 4, Harry picks up the post from the doormat—two letters and a postcard. One of the letters is sealed with wax, and Harry's eyes widen with surprise as he reads the address written in emerald green ink. As he walks slowly into the kitchen, still staring at the envelope, Dudley snatches the letter out of his hand. Uncle Vernon turns the letter over and looks at the coat of arms on the back, staring at his wife with horror, while Harry looks confused. An owl drops another letter, which flies into the letter box at Number 4, and the big bird joins two more perched on the TV aerial. Uncle Vernon tears up three identical letters addressed to Harry, and Harry peeps out of his cupboard and sees his uncle blocking up the letter box. Aunt Petunia sees Uncle Vernon off to work and stares at the owls perched on the car roof rack. She touches his arm as five more letters lie on the path at their feet. Inside the house, Harry watches helplessly as his uncle burns the envelopes one by one, Vernon smiling at him sadistically as he pokes the fire and the flames turn the letters to ashes. Harry hands round a plate of biscuits as Vernon relaxes in his armchair, then peers through the net curtains, where hundreds of owls are perched on the rooftops and cars in Privet Drive. A letter shoots down the chimney and flies past his nose, and Vernon blinks with surprise, then covers his ears as a rushing wind seems to fill the room. Suddenly, a flurry of letters cascades down the chimney and out into the sitting room, terrifying Dudley, who jumps onto his mother's lap. Harry chortles with glee as even more letters hurtle down the chimney, and like a snowstorm, the envelopes cover the carpet and spread around the room above their heads. Harry captures a letter and makes a dash for the cupboard under the stairs, but Uncle Vernon grabs him around the waist. Dudley and his mother escape into the hall, where more letters burst through the letterbox, and they stare at Vernon in horror.",
    "1140": "A metallic shield with the letters WB moves slowly forward out of darkness. A heap of skulls and bones is piled high behind iron railings. From the grinning mouth of a skull emerges the head of a large snake. Flickering its tongue, it slithers down onto a narrow path and moves silently between the gravestones in a dark and overgrown cemetery. The reptile's lithe body shimmers as it glides swiftly along the uneven path. The snake slides past a stone statue of a skeleton with huge wings, draped in a hooded cloak and holding a scythe. Metallic silver letters appear in the dark, glowering sky. A huge dilapidated house stands silhouetted against the night sky. A light is switched on in a cottage nearby. A disheveled old man lights the gas and puts on a kettle. He takes the top off a teapot, and picks up a tea bag. Through the kitchen window, he notices a light in the big house. He throws down the tea bag angrily and takes a bunch of keys from a hook, and leaves the cottage, lighting his way with a large torch. He stumbles across the uneven ground towards the big house. He hauls himself unsteadily up the stone steps to the large wooden door. Inside the house, the strong beam of the old man's torch flickers over dusty wooden paneling and a grandfather clock festooned with cobwebs. Grasping the wooden banister, he starts to climb the un-carpeted stairs, his torch casting eerie shadows over the paneled walls. He turns off his torch as he hears voices from an open doorway. The snake appears and slithers through the doorway towards a figure hidden in an armchair. The old man is engulfed in a flash of green light. In the cottage, the kettle boils. Harry jerks awake. Ron flops back onto his pillow. Mr. Weasley leads his group through a wood. A boy drops down. They climb a grassy slope. The faint glow of dawn appears in the sky. They all touch the boot which begins to spin like a Catherine wheel. They are pulled with it, spinning faster and faster, into a bright light. Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Harry, and the twins let go and land heavily. Harry looks up and sees Mr. Diggory, Cedric, and Mr. Weasley hiking sedately down to Earth. Cedric helps Harry up. They follow the others along a cliff top overlooking the sea. The sun rises as they look down on a gigantic campsite. Jugglers entertain the crowd as even more tents are erected. People on broomsticks fly dangerously low. Mr. Weasley leads them to a shabby two-man tent. Harry gawks. Inside the tiny tent, he sees a vast interior furnished with carpets, beds, and sofas.",
    "201": "Clarence, the angel whose voice has been heard from Heaven, is in the water, and George is seated before a wood-burning stove with his clothes drying on a line. He is wearing his long winter underwear, sipping a mug of hot coffee while staring at the stove, feeling cold, gloomy, and drunk, and ignoring Clarence and the tollkeeper as he remains preoccupied by his near-suicide and unsolved problems. George's underwear is a ludicrous seventeenth-century garment resembling a baby's nightshirt with embroidered cuffs and a collar, gathered at the neck with a drawstring. Clarence stands on the other side of the stove, putting on his undershirt, while the tollkeeper sits against the wall, eyeing them suspiciously. The tollkeeper becomes amazed by Clarence's garment, which falls below his knees, and shakes a book. The tollkeeper stares incredulously at Clarence, while George looks up, surprised. Throughout the scene, George is about to spit but is stopped each time by something amazing Clarence does or says. The tollkeeper, also about to spit, is stopped by Clarence's remarks and leans forward to spit again but is halted by Clarence's next statement, which causes George and the tollkeeper to react. George casually looks at the strange, smiling little man again and the tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George, who has been leaning against the wall and tipped back on two legs, touches his mouth while the tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. The tollkeeper rises and warily exits the door, looking as though he will call the nearest cop. George rubs his head to clear his mind and looks up at Clarence beside him. Clarence does not make much progress with George and glances up, pacing thoughtfully across the room. As Clarence speaks, the snow outside stops falling, and a strong wind blows open the shack door, prompting Clarence to run and close it. George notices Clarence speaking and cocks his head curiously towards his deaf ear, more interested in his hearing than what Clarence says. George feels his ear as Clarence talks and indicates his bad ear. He feels his lip, which shows no sign of the recent cut from Welch and is now thoroughly confused. George feels the clothes on the line, and they start dressing. George interrupts himself, and they reach the same empty street where George’s car had swerved into the tree near the sidewalk. As George and Clarence approach the spot where George had left his car smashed against the tree, George looks around to find his car missing and the tree undamaged.",
    "1262": "The rippling waters of Hogwarts' lake are surrounded by dark mountains, and on the far side, a white marble tomb on a tiny island has a large marble block that slides back as two supports beneath it tumble away. Dark Lord Voldemort leans down into the tomb, gazes at the black Elder Wand in his hand, and thrusts up his arm, causing a massive force of energy to shoot from the tip of the wand, illuminating the dark sky. Hovering Dementors, with trailing, tattered black robes, encircle Hogwarts as Severus Snape, in a black tunic and gown, stands in an upper archway gazing out at the mountains shrouded in mist. Subdued students in regimented ranks stride across the courtyard, and Snape watches them with a somber expression. The inscription on the gravestone reads while Harry Potter kneels at the foot of the grave, looking into a piece of broken mirror, where he sees himself reflected, then a face other than his own. The grave stands amongst sand dunes behind a small house, and Shell cottage faces a white beach with a sea beyond. Inside, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit in the lounge of the cottage, which is the home of Ron's brother, Bill, and sister-in-law Fleur. Luna Lovegood saunters up to a set of hanging chimes while Bill is in the kitchen, glancing at Fleur as Luna looks at the chimes. Harry strides in and faces Bill as Griphook, who has pointed ears and a long beaky nose, sits in an armchair with his hands clasped together and eyes closed. Bill shows Harry, Hermione, and Ron into the goblin's room, where Griphook, hands still clasped, stares ahead with his mouth firmly closed. Harry crosses to the window and looks out as the goblin grips the arms of the chair, his long filthy pointed nails visible before he clasps his hands again, staring at Harry. Harry looks at the sword of Gryffindor leaning against the wall while Griphook sits back in his chair, takes a deep breath, and again clasps his hands together as his eyes flick to the sword. He points at it, and Harry looks back at the sword. Downstairs in the kitchen, as Hermione, Ron, and Harry come out of the goblin's room, they stop on the landing, and Fleur shows them into a room where the old wand maker sits by a window, looking up at Harry. He hands a curved wand to Ollivander, who examines it closely as Harry passes him a plain, straight wand. Ollivander raises the wand tip to his left ear, turns it in his fingers, and gives the wand back to Harry. The old man leans forward, Ollivander looks away, eases back a little, his eyes widening as he stares solemnly at Harry. Harry gets up, and they leave as Hermione holds a long strand of curling, black hair.",
    "978": "Daisy toils backwards into her partner's arms, her feet leaving the floor as she is swept into an effortless turn. Daisy strikes an elegant pose, then turns to the audience and cranes a swan-like neck. She skips into her partner's arms, and he holds her above him with her knees bent and toes pointed. He lowers her as he turns, affecting the motion of a helter-skelter. Benjamin watches unblinkingly as they part, holding each other's gaze, only to embrace again in a capricious dance of attraction and repulsion. Backstage, Benjamin approaches a man with a clipboard and follows him through the corridor crowd, waiting by her dressing room door. Daisy steps out in her underwear, sees him, and hastily wraps a robe around herself. She turns to him, smiles, and regards the bouquet of white daisies he's given her. He lowers his eyes, and beaming, she retreats into the dressing room. Benjamin turns with a look of disappointment. He and Daisy step out of the lift and cross the dimly lit party where people dance and drink. Benjamin looks timid as Daisy offers a smile when a handsome dark-haired young man embraces her from behind. Smiling broadly, Daisy trots off, and David and Benjamin watch as a guy takes Daisy's coat. She dances playfully with him as David makes a beeline for the dance floor where Daisy talks with a middle-aged woman and an elderly man. Benjamin watches solemnly as David snatches her away and dances closely with her, toiling her around. They share a lingering kiss, parting when Daisy starts talking, only to be swept away in mid-sentence by another man. Benjamin stops slowly towards the lift as Daisy dances between two guys. With an arm around David, Daisy looks up to see Benjamin leave. Benjamin pulls on his coat, steps out onto the street, and strides away. Daisy canters out after him as a yellow taxi pulls up with David waiting by it. Daisy turns to Benjamin, shrugs slightly, and he blinks. She turns away, shakes her head as Benjamin remains uncomprehending, and goes to the taxi. Benjamin walks away hat in hand as the taxi drives off in the other direction. At the hospital, Caroline looks at the theater flyer and takes a manila envelope from Daisy's bag, which contains photos of Daisy as a young dancer. Light snowfall occurs as Daisy and the young man stroll through Moscow, and later, Daisy lies in bed with the young man. Caroline reads while Benjamin, wearing a brown leather jacket and dark glasses, cruises along a tree-lined road on a cherry red motorcycle. He is seen stripping paint from the porch of a retirement home, and wearing white overalls and a cap, Benjamin nods soberly and descends a stepladder.",
    "669": "As he enters, she rises, crosses over to him, and throws her arms around his neck. Standing by the front door, he hugs her tight. At Quest Proving Grounds, bunker six, a car draws up, and General Slocum emerges from it. The two men move into the bunker, and the exoskeleton is powered up. Captain Curtis stands upright inside the 10-foot-tall rocket as it lifts off. A green fireball flies towards the bunker, resulting in total destruction. At the graduation, Peter's classes photograph, and Harry turns to his father. Father and son shake hands, as Peter, in his mortarboard and gown, stands awkwardly. They spot MJ with Flash and part. Peter nods his head stiffly and manages a weak smile. Later, he and Aunt May arrive home, with Peter in a suit, shirt, and tie, and Aunt May in a floral suit, hat, and carrying her gloves. Peter turns and charges sturdily up the stairs to his room, while Aunt May takes a few paces forward, her head tilted to one side, and watches with a sad and witty face until he disappears. That night, he's sitting up in his bedroom, his tie loosened a little but still on, with tears rolling slowly down his cheeks as he gazes distantly ahead. Aunt May, in her dressing gown, comes to the doorway and softly comes in, sitting down next to her nephew on the bed with her hands on her lap. He acknowledges her presence with a hint of a smile as she leans close to him, placing her hands on his shoulders. He smiles, and Aunt May rises, puts her right hand on his left shoulder, gently squeezes it, and goes. Peter sits deep in thought, then a sparkle comes into his eyes. Inside a small case is a sweatshirt with a spider and web motif, and underneath it is a sketchpad with the original snug-fitting Spider-Man outfit: blue body stocking, a hooded mask, red and black checked shoulder pants, and the chest, with a large black spider in the center. The New York City streets host a delicatessen run by an Oriental couple who are being held up. As two robbers make their escape, Spider-Man swoops down on them, returns the stolen money, and thrusts the two robbers up on a giant spider's web. A girl is being robbed at gunpoint, and then the front page of the Daily Bugle is shown. MJ, in a waitress outfit, walks out of the Moon Dance Diner, putting on her coat, as Peter is on the sidewalk and senses her presence. He turns, chases after her, and they look awkwardly at each other as Enrique heads back to the diner. MJ opens her coat to let Peter see her uniform.",
    "1088": "More cannonballs explode the Bielski lines, claiming more victims. Asael fires his gun blind, the smoke obscuring his vision. Tuvia tosses a bag at Malvin and hares away across the field, his physical and mental strength restored. The two of them dive into thick woodland, moving behind the enemy lines, with a view of the German soldiers and their tank ahead of them. They crouch down as half a dozen Germans come past and set up a gun position in front of them. With murder in his eyes, Tuvia cocks his machine gun and steps forward, gunning down every single man. Tuvia appropriates the German gun, takes up a position in the undergrowth behind the German line, and fires on the troops who are facing away from them, killing a number of them. The Germans regroup. The heavy tank gun is slowly turned in Tuvia and Malvin's direction. As the black mouth of the big gun moves near, Tuvia leaps out of the way and dives behind a tree. A tank fires into the undergrowth behind him. More Germans zip across the field and take up positions just yards away from them. Shells explode to the right and left of Tuvia, but miss their mark. Malbin is cowering behind a nearby tree. The tank gun fires again, showering them both with gunpowder and debris. Malbin prepares an explosive. With gritted teeth, Malbin urges from behind the tree and runs at the tank, but is shot. The missile explodes around him. The helmeted Germans fire in Tuvia's direction. Shells ricochet off the trees around him. One soldier creeps nearer, but is shot in the back. His fellow troops look behind them for a split second as guns fire at them from behind a wall of trees. Zus comes surging out of the trees, single-handedly decimating the Germans caught off guard. The rest of his men follow him out of the trees and set about the rest. As the tank operator fires again, Zus clambers up onto the tank and draws his pistol. The tank operator flops to one side. Zus drops a grenade into the tank. His men spread across the field in alarmed marching in step and fire on the remaining Germans. With not one left standing, Zus gets to his feet on the side of the tank, his eyes anxiously searching the trees. His men go through the dead soldiers' pockets. Tuvia emerges from out of the hazy smoke, his piercing blue eyes darting from side to side. The Bielski Otriad, lying on the side of the hill with their guns at the ready, raise their heads. Slowly, they begin to scramble to their feet and walk to the top of the sunny slope.",
    "227": "He turns to see an extremely pretty young woman gazing adoringly at him while they are jostled and shoved, and his eyes light up. Jurek pushes in beside them and takes her arm, pulling Dorota as he fights his way down the stairs, and he too is carried with the flow into the lobby where debris is everywhere. Szpilman fights to get to the main door when another bomb explodes, filling the air with dust and debris, obscuring him and everyone else. The Szpilman family is in panic, coming and going out of rooms, packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk in a comfortable, tastefully furnished bourgeois apartment, the living room lined with books, paintings, and boasting a boudoir grand, silver platters, and candlesticks. Szpilman sits by the radio set, ear to the speaker, trying to tune to a station, while Father, holding a silver-framed photograph, crosses to Mother. He goes into his room as she can barely control her tears and hurries into the kitchen just as the front door opens and Szpilman enters, looking around bemused by the activity. Mother dashes out of the kitchen and starts to look as the others continue to bustle and pack. They gather round, and Henryk hits the set. Father pours liqueur into glasses, and the family is seated around the dining table, having just finished a meal, the table groaning with the remains. They all clink glasses and drink. A column of German soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, marches into view. On the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins and smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including Szpilman and Henryk, with Father craning to see. They watch expressionless as the Germans march past. Regina is opening and closing the window, examining the frame with her fingers, while at the other end, Father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. Henryk is deep in thought, and Szpilman is fiddling with his father's violin. The apartment has less furniture now and the silver is gone. They all look at the table: it's covered in stains, and the veneer is coming away at one end until it snaps, revealing bare wood beneath. They start to hide the things. Szpilman is on the public telephone, waiting for someone to answer his call. Szpilman and Dorota stroll along a tree-lined street with bombed-out buildings and rubble. She flicks admiring, almost loving glances at him as they walk and talk, and he is smiling, touched by her. She's embarrassed and begins to laugh, and they become almost helpless, holding on to each other. Amidst their laughter, he takes her hand and kisses it. The family is gathered around the table, listening to Father reading from the newspaper.",
    "161": "The camera sweeps over the crowd, past the loudspeakers on their poles. We see surly knots of belligerent rowdies, mostly young, but not all, hanging on the fringes as we move over the heads of the mass of listening people to a platform where Nehru speaks. Azad, Suhrawardy, and others sit on the floor behind him. Featuring the Muslim leader Suhrawardy, leaning against a wall, watching an action out of shot with evident tension. There are five men facing Gandhi. They wear black trousers and black knit vests. There are thongs around their arms that make their bulging muscles seem even more powerful. Their clothes are dirty -- and they are too -- but they are laying knives and guns at Gandhi's feet. Mirabehn, Azad, Pyarelal, the doctor and others on the roof watch fascinated, a little frightened. Gandhi is looking at him, testing, not giving or accepting anything that is mere gesture. The Goondas stand. They glance at Suhrawardy; he smiles tautly and they start to leave, but one (Nahari) lingers. Suddenly he moves violently toward Gandhi, taking a flat piece of Indian bread (chapati) from his trousers and tossing it forcefully on Gandhi. Mirabehn and Azad start to move toward him -- the man looks immensely strong and immensely unstable. But Gandhi holds up a shaking hand, stopping them. Nahari's face is knotted in emotion, half anger, half almost a child's fear -- but there is a wild menace in that instability. Gandhi stares at him, breathless. It is as though the man has told him of some terrible self-inflicted wound. Almost reflexively he holds his hand out to indicate the height of his son. He glares at Suhrawardy and then back at Gandhi. He is sobbing, but in his anger it seems almost as though he means to kill Gandhi in retaliation. A long moment, as Gandhi meets his pain and wrath. Nahari sneers, but there is just a flicker of desperate curiosity. He raises his hand to the height Nahari has indicated as his son's. Nahari has listened. His face almost cracks -- it is a chink of light, but it does not illumine his darkness. And now the light falls on Nahari. His face stiffens, he swallows, fighting any show of emotion; then he turns to go. But he takes only a step and he turns back, going to his knees, the sobs breaking again and again from his heaving body as he holds his head to Gandhi's feet in the traditional greeting of Hindu son to Hindu father. A second, and Gandhi reaches out and touches the top of his head. Trucks with riot squads (shields and truncheons) in place, but they are lounging, waiting.",
    "741": "In her mind's eye, she sees Constantine sitting on the front steps, plaiting Skeeter's hair when she was a little girl, and she smiles at the memory. On a rainy street corner, Miss Stein puts two piles of slim hardbacks with pale blue covers into the window of a bookshop. Minnie, frying chicken, opens her envelope of money, slips it into the front of her dress, and runs out, leaving the chicken to burn. At the retirement home, Mrs. Walters is reading to some of the residents from the book and turns the page with a glib smile. Later, she's on the phone to her daughter. Aibileen and Minnie are pushing trolleys in a supermarket; Aibileen steps to one side to let a white lady pass, but coming to the end of an aisle, her eyes widen, and she hastily steps backwards. Minnie sees her as well and presses herself against the aisle. They both steel themselves to walk past, but the beefy woman is utterly engrossed. At Skeeter's house, Stuart comes striding out onto the porch with a face like thunder, turns on his heel, and marches off towards his Jeep, leaving Skeeter looking bemused and tearful. She takes two copies. At home, Charlotte is sitting up in bed next to her sleeping husband, reading the book. Sinking down into her pillow, she takes off her specs with an appalled look on her face. Elizabeth, sitting in a rocking chair, is reading it as she bottle-feeds her baby. Yule Mae is reading to her prison inmates. Hilly's reading it in bed; later, she sifts through her post, opens an envelope, and finds a note from Celia Foote. She smirks as she unfolds the enclosed check, tears it into tiny pieces, and storms out of the house. Steaming along a straight dirt road between two green fields, kicking up a storm of dust, she sits at the wheel of the Ford Fairlane station wagon, her lips curling. She glugs back some beer, spilling some over her blouse, swerves the car, glugs down the rest, puffs on a cigarette, and throws the empty bottle into the backseat. Skeeter receives a letter from Elaine Stein offering her a job as a junior editor at Harper & Row Publishers. Hilly arrives in front of Skeeter's house in a storm of dust and marches towards the front door like an angry chicken, hurls a pebble at Skeeter, a cold sore. Charlotte, looking elegant in a tight-fitting turban, smiles loftily at Hilly, and she and Skeeter can barely keep a straight face. Charlotte gropes for Skeeter's hand as they come into the spacious parquet floored hall, with Charlotte suddenly looking very tired.",
    "314": "Evan stares dumbstruck at the machine while Mr. Miller puts the camera on a tripod in the basement. Kayleigh and Evan sit on folding chairs in front of the camera as Tommy stands at the top of the basement stairs, looking down. Mr. Miller lowers his voice and speaks to Evan and Kayleigh, then gets behind the lens. Someone silently opens the door at the top of the basement stairs and watches with horror. Mr. Miller walks behind Kayleigh and cups his hands tightly around her ears, so she can't hear anything now. Evan leans over to whisper in Kayleigh's ear. Kayleigh stares at the floor, then looks up at her father and shivers. Evan whips around to see Kayleigh watching him, causing him to lurch back from the shock and fall to the floor. She sees Evan's nose bleed, and her eyes go wide. Evan, still stunned, can do little but stare from the floor. He stands in the middle of her bedroom, surrounded by sorority plaques and pink preppy decor, hardly able to take his eyes off her as she hands him a tissue. He reaches for his clothes at the foot of the bed and comes up with a Greek-lettered fraternity sweatshirt and brown suede jacket, then frowns with distaste, grabs a towel, and heads out. At the sink, Evan washes the blood off his face and looks at his reflection in the mirror. Evan turns around and sees Gwen, one of the sorority brats from the bar, exit the shower naked; she pats his ass and exits the bathroom. Kayleigh, wearing a long skirt and tight red sweater, catches the eye of every guy on campus as she and Evan stroll arm in arm through the quad. Many students wave to Evan and call his name. Kayleigh gives him a big unexpected kiss and walks away. After a moment of wow, Evan runs off to class himself. Evan inserts his last quarter into the lobby pay phone and dials a telephone number. He hangs up the phone, then checks his watch. At that moment, Thumper passes Evan in the lobby, walks away, leaving Evan dumbfounded. Evan runs into the lecture hall and gets in line behind other students who are taking No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk, then he walks up the aisle and takes a seat. As he sits down, someone puts their arm menacingly around Evan's throat. Evan flinches, turns around, and sees Hunter, the frat guy Thumper assaulted the other night at Dirty Hank's bar. Hunter surreptitiously hands Evan a cheat-sheet to the exam. Evan nods and smiles as exams are passed down his row. Finally, Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex.",
    "887": "Lizzie is sitting on Jane's sickbed and gently strokes her sleeping sister's face. Jane slowly opens her eyes and looks weakly at Lizzie, who gives her a hopeful smile. In the dining room, Miss Bingley's good humor fades, and someone stalks across the room as Lizzie is shown in. Two spaniels frighten pheasants from a bush as Lizzie watches the shooting party from Jane's bedroom window. She turns to look at her pale sister, who smiles weakly up at her, and Lizzie smiles back tearfully. The hunting party makes its way back to Netherfield Hall under a twilight sky. Lizzie turns away from a mirror, wearing a white silk gown, and the sisters smile at each other. Lizzie then walks down a staircase, looks around uncertainly, and is startled by a footman. She smiles gratefully, looks around nervously, unsure of where the drawing room is, and walks into a dark corridor. She enters the billiard room where Darcy is playing alone, and he swiftly bows to her. Hesitating in the doorway for a moment, she hurries out, while Darcy looks after her thoughtfully before continuing his game. Later, Lizzie is reading a book in the drawing room. Darcy glances at the card game in progress, then crosses over to Lizzie and takes a seat at a desk while eyebrows are raised. Darcy realizes he is being spoken to, and Lizzie smiles as he holds her in a steady, thoughtful gaze. Mrs. Bennet is being driven in a carriage as Lydia and Kitty excitedly poke their heads out of the window to see the grand red brick facade of Netherfield Hall. Mrs. Bennet and the girls are shown in. Meanwhile, Darcy walks away, and Mr. Bingley glares at his sniggering sisters before Lizzie takes a seat. Bingley glances over at Darcy, and Lizzie closes her eyes in embarrassment. Darcy is then seen washing in a copper bath as a servant enters and pours a large jug of water over his head and back. Darcy flicks water from his hair, leans back on towels against the high end of the bath, leaves himself out of the bath, and into a dressing gown held open for him by a servant. He wraps the robe around himself and crosses to the window, where he sees Lizzie in the garden below. She is playing with a dog, trying to wrestle a stick from its mouth. Standing at the window, Darcy watches her every move. Meanwhile, Mr. Hurst is fast asleep in a chair while Mrs. Hurst is also seated.",
    "820": "Bernie backs out of the driveway and speeds along the road, gripping the steering wheel, while Jessica follows him, honking the horn desperately and running a red light. In the back garden, Molly hands her a glass of champagne, and there's a Crazy Golf windmill. Bernie floors Cal, and Jacob pulls Bernie off Cal, but Bernie punches Jacob, wrenches the sails off the windmill, and drops them. All four guys wrestle and struggle, tangled together, then fall. They sit on a wall side by side, David with an icepack on his cheek, as police officers arrive and then head off. Jacob laughs, and David and Bernie turn to look at Cal before the police officers leave. Emily takes a big sigh, and Hannah and Jessica stare at the ground. Bernie gets up, followed by Jessica who scurries after him, nervously running her fingers through her ponytail, as Robbie watches them go. He gets up and jogs around the corner after them, but then stops. Bernie limps slightly as they reach the end of the driveway, and Jessica glances back at Robbie, looking ashamed. Robbie turns away and shuffles back dejectedly, while the other three men remain sitting on the wall. Cal stands, Emily smiles bitterly while shaking her head, and Hannah frowns, her eyes filled with hurt. Emily gawks at Cal, and Hannah gives Jacob a small nod before he gets up. She wanders away, followed by Jacob, as Emily glares at Cal, and Molly comes out. Hannah and Jacob leave, and Robbie lets his head drop forward. With his brow furrowed, Cal looks down at the ground, and Emily eyes him angrily with her jaw clenched. Cal heads off, while Emily folds her arms. Cal approaches Robbie, who leans against the wall of the house. Cal smiles, nods, and leaves. Molly sits down on the garden steps, putting her head in her hand, as Cal lumbers down the driveway. At school, kids mill past Robbie, who sits alone on the stairs with his head bowed, and he presses Jessica's name on his phone's contact list. In her bedroom, Jessica lounges on her bed, staring into the distance. In Jacob's apartment, Hannah and Jacob are together, as Jacob holds out the phone to Hannah. Emily is at her desk in her office, writing, looking up and pouting sadly. At school, students pour out of the building, and Cal stands outside by his car, spotting Robbie, but Robbie eyes him balefully and walks off in another direction. Cal sits at the counter of a bar, his head resting on his hands, hunched with his head hung. He raises his head as Jacob sits next to him and scans the bar. The bartender sells Cal a shot and shrugs at Jacob. Cal and Jacob both stare down at the bar, and Jacob looks away.",
    "326": "Lurtz is leading 200 Uruk-hai out of Isengard as they run fast, their powerful legs carrying them at speed. The Fellowship are in small elven boats, and elves quietly watch them depart. They row away from the Lothlorien shore into the Silverlode river, and in his head, Frodo still hears her voice. Galadriel gives Frodo a small Crystal Phial, and as the Fellowship's boats drift past, Galadriel stands alone, watching from the banks of the river. The boats pass into the great river Anduin, and the three elven boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward. Green trees slowly give way to a brown and withered land, while the Uruk forces run through the trees with deadly purpose. Aragorn watches them with concern. The three elven boats drift slowly through the steep rocky gorge in the pre-dawn light, with Aragorn slowly paddling in the stern. Frodo slowly looks up, his eyes widening with amazement. Aragorn is strangely moved by the beauty of the silent sentinels, and he speaks almost as if to himself. Two enormous rock statues, towering like 300-foot pinnacles on either side of the river, are carved images of Gondorian kings of old. They loom over the boats with power and majesty. The Fellowship stare in stunned silence as the current takes them through the narrow gap between the statues' feet, craning up past the statues' vast crumbling heads to reveal a large lake only a mile downriver. As they leap out of the boats and clamber onto the wooded shore, Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency. Aragorn looks at Legolas, knowing full well what he means, and Legolas casts a glance around into the Parth Galen forest. Sam has slumped asleep, and Merry dumps a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet. Sam sits up with a start, and Aragorn's head snaps round, his eyes flying to Boromir's shield which lies abandoned by his camp bed as he realizes Boromir has gone. Frodo is walking beneath the trees, lost in thought. Frodo turns slowly and stares at Boromir, tense and cautious. Boromir has started forward towards Frodo, but he pulls himself up. Frodo steps hurriedly away from Boromir and turns to leave. Boromir leaps on top of Frodo, grasping for the ring, and Frodo has only moments to act. Frodo rips the ring from around his neck and rams it on his finger. Frodo races through the misty twilight world, past the foggy shapes of twisted trees, and somewhere behind him, Boromir's distraught voice carries from another dimension. A mountain of iron, immeasurably strong, the tower of adamant: Barad-dur, fortress of Sauron. Frodo suddenly finds himself on the stone steps and clambers up the stairs onto a high seat, perched on four stone pillars. Frodo cowers on the seat, like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings, as the world of mist swirls around him.",
    "1149": "Through a bright gap in the clouds, a huge coach appears, drawn by seven winged white horses, and students crowd into the school cloisters, gazing up in excitement as it swoops down toward them. Hagrid guides the horses to land and dives for cover as the coach flies low over his head. A tall mast flying a slender pennant emerges from the center of the lake, and a huge golden galleon rises majestically to the surface, with water spilling from its decks. Huge sails are unfurled, and the great ship glides smoothly toward the school. Gasping for breath, Filch, the caretaker, runs down the hall and whispers to Professor Dumbledore before running out again. A troop of elegant girls glide into the hall, dancing in blue silk uniforms that flatter their slim figures, and Ron gawks at the girls as tiny bluebirds flutter around them. Seamus gapes as the headmistress, Madame Maxime, who is over eight feet tall, passes and towers over Professor Dumbledore. The visitors drop a graceful curtsy, and Madame Maxime smiles graciously, her face framed by a huge fur collar, and extends her hand for Dumbledore to reach up and kiss. The Durmstrang students stride dramatically into the hall, wearing Slavic, military-style uniforms, each carrying a long staff, and sparks fly as they spin them round and strike the stone floor. Two of them hurtle forward, somersaulting high into the air as a handsome student with close-cropped hair strides past, whom Ron recognizes as his Quidditch hero. A student blows a ring of fire, and High Master Karkaroff, wearing a long white coat and a Russian hat, greets Dumbledore. A storm rages around Hogwarts as a dark, disheveled figure limps through the rain toward the school, and Hagrid accidentally stabs Professor Flitwick's hand. Dumbledore steps forward as Crouch rises, and a figure limps into the hall amid flashes of lightning from the enchanted ceiling, raising his wand to make the lightning retreat. Ron recognizes Moody, who has a scarred face and a large, protruding false eye fixed to another eye patch that swivels erratically and lingers on Harry, with one foot encased in a metal boot. Moody takes a swig from a hip flask as Mr. Crouch nervously addresses the students while Dumbledore raises his hand towards an ornate, jeweled cabinet that dissolves to reveal an ancient stone goblet with a bright blue flame leaping from its wide mouth, which continues to burn. The Durmstrang galleon strains at its moorings as the blue flame flickers eerily in the great hall. Igor Karkaroff enters cautiously and carefully closes the door behind him as Moody writes on the blackboard and advances, causing Ron to look petrified and Hermione apprehensive. Moody takes a lid from a glass jar, scoops out a spider, produces his wand, and makes the spider grow bigger.",
    "1305": "The side door opens with almost no sound as the hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room where a very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer, indicating two or three days' worth. David stares out from under his hood at the mess with cabinets left open and the breakfast table being the eeriest thing in the room, frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. David moves slowly to a door in the kitchen, which is slightly open, shielding his face from the strong smell as he pulls the door open quietly. At the bottom of the basement stairs is a man's body, the same man who answered the door in the flashback, lying partly in shadow, partly in light, with his crumpled tie folded over itself on his still chest. David steps into the unoccupied room, his movements slow and tense, and looks up, following the sound as it moves around above. David moves to the stairs just as someone gets knocked out above, at a point where three closed doors converge on a landing. He opens the closest door, finding a young girl's room adorned with posters of boy bands and clothes strewn everywhere, but the room is empty. In the bathroom, a slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old, is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack, sitting with her arms pointed upward over her head, knees tucked up to her chest, next to her younger brother, a skinny boy, maybe twelve, tied and seated in the same way. Their heads are leaned back against their arms, completely listless, with eyes half-mast, as they watch the door to the bathroom open and David Dunne's dark hooded figure step in, his long dark rain poncho still dripping water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them, their arms flopping to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them, the boy blinking once slowly. David takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood, then stares at the drawing before turning to look at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her sixties who stands next to him. The woman turns and looks at David for the first time as David looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers, both watching Elijah from across the room as Elijah's mother walks across the store and waits for Elijah to finish talking. David then turns back to the framed sketch.",
    "132": "The officer commanding and the Guard of Honor await him. The young Englishman glances at him quizzically. The General has taken the salute and moves to inspect the troops to the accompaniment of the military band. He is suddenly aware of a well-dressed Indian half-listening to their conversation. He glances at him and the well-dressed Indian simply nods slightly and moves off a little. The second Englishman grimaces at the young Englishman and looks down again. Another far less elaborate gangplank extends from the aft section of the ship. Third Class passengers are disembarking here, and on shore, separated by a wire fence from the rest of the pier. A large crowd of Indians is reacting excitedly to someone coming down the gangplank but we can't yet see that person. The young Englishman glances back cautiously toward the well-dressed Indian again, then. Gandhi is smiling, trying to move on, but answering the questions of an Indian journalist. He speaks with an uncertainty and tentativeness that he had lost in South Africa, patently overwhelmed by the reception. An English journalist catches him as he turns. An exuberant woman puts a garland over his shoulders. An Indian reporter has cornered Ba behind him. She joins her hands, acknowledging a garland placed around her shoulders, and pushes on after Gandhi. Charlie helps to guide her. The young Nehru, somewhat amused by all the excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a little flower-covered platform. We see a banner: THE CONGRESS PARTY. He grins. He has guided Gandhi to the first step of the platform. Another garland is wrapped around Gandhi's shoulders, and in some embarrassment, he mounts the platform. There is a great cheer, but in the silence that follows we hear the military band from across the way as the troops prepare to march off. Gandhi looks around at the crowd. Finally he speaks out. He makes the pranam and starts for the steps. The crowd is a little disappointed, but they manage a cheer and applause. Nehru is standing next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man (Patel). Nehru has slammed the door of a gleaming Rolls Royce touring car, the top down. He has seated Gandhi in it beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack. An Indian chauffeur rides in front. The crowd still surges around and Gandhi is looking apprehensively back for Ba. He grins boyishly, in part to comfort, in part unable to contain his amusement at Gandhi and his evident confusion. With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car pulls off. He finally turns to Patel. There are crowds along the street, and Gandhi -- in surprise that they are for him -- waves tentatively. Patel waves too but he eyes Gandhi rather critically.",
    "426": "The balls are already racked and ready as Willie collects their stake money and prepares to toss the coin. Preacher and Big John draw up their chairs around the table, while Bert also takes a seat far away, near the coat rack. Willie taps Fats on the lapel to signal it's his break, and Sausage sends the cue ball down the table to begin the game. Fats makes a good break, leaving the cue ball teetering over the far corner pocket. Eddie looks at the lineup of the balls, then sets down his cue and walks over to the washroom, glancing at Bert as he sprinkles powder on his hands. He turns, snatches up his cue, and rams a bank shot into the pack, pocketing the one ball as the others scatter. The crowd applauds, and Eddie moves swiftly to his next shot, talking to Bert as he plays. Bert and Fats exchange glances as Eddie returns to his game, with Fats waiting for his turn, puffing steadily on his cigarette. Bert shifts uneasily in his chair as we hear the pool balls knock together and roll down the track through the belly of the table. The shot goes in, and Eddie looks significantly at Fats, who lowers his eyes and puffs on his cigarette. The balls are racked again, and Eddie sinks shots right and left—some tricky, some not—prompting uneasy looks between Bert and Fats. Eddie circles the table like a hawk. When it's Fats's turn, he is up, his jacket off and tie pulled loose, but after making a shot and chalking his cue, he misses a hard shot. Eddie moves to take his shot, ignoring Fats, while Bert looks on as Eddie continues to shoot pool, making all his shots quickly and accurately. A depressed Fats watches, as the clock over the door reads six o'clock. Fats remains in his seat with a drink in hand as Eddie slips into his jacket, helped by Preacher. Eddie unscrews his cue thoughtfully, while Bert's bodyguards stand waiting for instruction. Fats listens, head bowed, as Bert's men start to move forward but are stopped by a gesture from Bert, who tries to smile a friendly smile. Eddie puts away his cue, staring at Bert before looking over at the downcast face of Minnesota Fats, who looks up at Eddie. Eddie takes his cue case and heads for the door, pausing for a moment to look around at the rows of empty tables before leaving. Ames then returns to normal as Fats puts on his coat, Henry sweeps up, and Bert takes his seat again on his throne overlooking Ames, sipping his glass of milk.",
    "811": "A fast-moving road is seen under a lowering sky when a flash of lightning strikes a dead tree, causing it to sprout leaves. In a store, teenage girls try on funky shoes while a little girl nearby tries on dull, brown shoes and is giggled at by the long-haired nymphets. Her mom leads her down the street, and she looks awestruck as women try on clothes, observing a woman pay with a credit card. The little girl eventually grows up and enters a similar luxury store, spraying on perfume and hugging a shop assistant, while her colleague, Claire, simpers. Rebecca stares at her credit card bill and holds up the apparently missing card while her friend Suze reads from Rebecca's resume in a washroom. Rebecca, with her long, red hair loose and wearing a stylish tartan cape, comes down a fashionable shopping street and stops in front of the window of Denny and George. Her jaw drops and quivers with excitement at the sight of a green chiffon scarf on a mannequin, prompting her to venture inside and make a deliberate beeline for the scarf. The mannequin speaks to her, and Rebecca crosses to an assistant, tenses, then beams, and produces a second card. She beetles down the street towards a hot dog stand, joining a long queue. The man paying for a hot dog buys her one with a $20 bill and then turns to face her. With the green scarf flowing behind her, she dashes towards a tall, glass-topped building, rides an internal elevator, and totters towards a reception desk carrying an apricot-colored briefcase. A pair of studded, six-inch, killer heels attached to a tall, blonde woman in a black dress with a fur collar approach, and she gives Rebecca a quick once-over, causing Rebecca's bag to spring open while she forces a smile. Alicia smiles loftily at her and sashays away, leaving Rebecca to turn back to the pixie-like receptionist and rip a visitors' card from his hand. In a waiting room, she sits between two women and two men reading broadsheet papers, and the brunette next to her watches her disapprovingly. She then finds herself in the office of the hot-dog Englishman, and, aghast, she pulls off the scarf and throws it under a desk. As he sits down, he recognizes her, and she struggles with the lock on her case while the editor pulls a face, making Rebecca look like a rabbit caught in the headlights. However, the editor merely rests his chin on his hand and looks at her benignly. As she leaves, she collides with a glass partition, wanders along the sun-bleached pavement beneath huge fashion posters on her way back to the office, and encounters an immediate termination notice as both girls stare at the phone.",
    "1316": "Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins, one dressed in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero. A line of waiting children is present as Marcus makes his way through, eliciting gasps and cheers from the kids. Playing to the crowd, Marcus takes a bottle from the floor and swigs from it while Marcus stares at him. He then grabs the hat, slams it into Willie's chest, and as Willie rises, kicks him in the ass. On the outskirts of the Saguaro Square Mall's parking lot, a city bus stops with a hiss and the doors open to reveal a pathetic EIGHT-YEAR-OLD KID, overweight, snot-nosed, badly dressed, and probably smelling of pee. As the kid nears the mall entrance, he passes a group of older children doing skateboard stunts, who notice him. Marcus puts another young boy on his lap and then walks over to the rope. The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, frozen by fear, but Marcus's actions penetrate the Kid's fear and he moves. Marcus leads the Kid up to the throne and places him on Willie's lap. The Kid just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot, which Willie can't help but stare at. Suddenly, the Kid yanks Willie's beard, holding it stretched below Willie's chin. Willie shoves the Kid, who backs away, looking at him in awe and never breaking his reverent stare. The Kid sits on a bench, watching the entrance to Chamberlain's. After a beat, Willie and Marcus walk out in costume and cross toward the parking lot, with the Kid following from a safe distance. Willie and Marcus walk across the huge empty parking lot, followed at a great distance by the Kid, who creeps closer to hear their conversation. A large faux rustic bar is filled to capacity with loosened-tie middle-management as we follow someone's gaze around the room until it connects with the drunken, glowering face of a Hindustani Troublemaker sitting right across from him, startling Willie for a moment. She pours two drinks, and they both pound them back as she pours. Willie stares at her while the man stares at him for a beat. The Troublemaker stops and looks down to find the Kid beating on his legs, allowing Willie a chance to regain composure. The Kid sits in the front seat next to Willie, who drives while stewing and answering absently, with his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs. Willie escorts the Kid along a long walkway leading to the front door of a large, opulent, new-money Southwestern home, admiring the surroundings.",
    "211": "The full moon is shining through the trees as George finishes talking and jumps up out of his chair. As he speaks, a man leaves the porch, goes into his house, and slams the door. Mary then runs off the scene, but George, standing on the belt of her bathrobe, inadvertently causes it to come off as she runs. He drops his bundle of clothes and picks up Mary's robe but cannot see her anywhere. We see Mary's face peering out from the leaves as George walks toward the bush, about to throw her the robe when a thought strikes him. Meanwhile, Mary thrashes around in the bushes, and headlights flash into the scene as the old Bailey automobile, driven by Harry with Uncle Billy beside him, drives in. George throws Mary's robe over the bush and gets into the car, and as it drives off, Mary, now wearing the robe, rises from the bush, following the car with her eyes. Subsequently, around a long table, about twelve directors, substantial citizens of Bedford Falls such as Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, and a real estate salesman, are seated, along with Uncle Billy and George. Dr. Campbell is the Chairman of the Board. Before each director are individual reports for them to study along with folders and papers on which they have been reporting. Henry F. Potter, with his goon beside his wheelchair, is prominently seated among them. Dr. Campbell rises from his seat, and George and Uncle Billy start to collect their papers and leave the table, surprising everyone. George stands at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to leave, but puts them down, incensed by what Potter is saying about his father, and comes back to the table. George then leaves the room, followed by the jubilant Uncle Billy. Potter's face is grim with hatred as he is interrupted by a babble of talk as the directors argue. George, visibly shaken, busies himself with his bag and papers while Uncle Billy follows him around, chattering and worried about the outcome of the meeting, which might alter his plans regarding dissolving the Building and Loan. Ernie stands in the doorway, and a jubilant Dr. Campbell comes running out. Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly, and Uncle Billy cheer wildly as Dr. Campbell and George shake hands. The stars from the opening sequence twinkle once more as voices from Heaven are heard. Meanwhile, a number of people wait for the train, and Uncle Billy is seated on a baggage wagon eating peanuts as George paces up and down in front of him.",
    "99": "A footage of Neil Armstrong's first step on the moon is shown on television, followed by Forrest looking at a man. A large mural of Mao Tse-tung hangs on the wall while Forrest plays ping-pong against a Chinese player as a crowd of communist leaders sit and watch. Dick Cavett stands up to introduce Forrest, who makes his way onto the stage and shakes hands with Cavett. Forrest sits down between John Lennon and Cavett and looks oddly at Lennon, who lights a cigarette. A guard lets Forrest out a side entrance door, and Forrest steps and then stops as he hears a man in a wheelchair speak to him. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan, who is dirty with long hair, as Dan's wheelchair begins to slide down the ramp and spins on the icy ground. Forrest watches as Lt. Dan crashes at the bottom of the ramp. Taxi cabs crowd the street as Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along the sidewalk, with one taxi driver honking as Lt. Dan gets wheeled out in front of it. Another taxi skids to a stop, almost hitting them as they cross the street, and Lt. Dan slaps the bumper of the taxi. A Bob Hope Christmas special in Vietnam plays on television as Lt. Dan and Forrest watch. Lt. Dan chuckles, drinks the rest of a bottle of wine, and tosses it down before looking at Forrest. He wheels himself over to the television and turns it off, picks up another bottle of port wine which is empty, and tosses it onto the floor. Lt. Dan becomes enraged, throws the bottle, and looks at Forrest as a television shows Dick Clark emceeing the Times Square New Year's Eve celebration. Two sleazy women named Lenore and Carla walk up to Lt. Dan. Lenore fixes her makeup and leans to speak into Forrest's ear. The people in the bar cheer, kiss, blow horns, and toss confetti into the air. Forrest looks around as Carla and Lenore lean over and kiss him. Carla removes her top and sits on top of Dan in his wheelchair, and they kiss and play around. Forrest sits in a chair, then Lenore leaps on him and begins to kiss him, reaching down to his crotch. Forrest stands up nervously, causing Lenore to fall to the floor. Lenore stands up, angry, as Lt. Dan throws Carla back onto the bed. Lt. Dan falls out of his wheelchair and lands on the floor as Carla and Lenore laugh and leave the apartment. Forrest tries to help Lt. Dan.",
    "1006": "As she sits for a portrait wearing formal robes of state, the Queen's attention is drawn by television news coverage of Tony Blair, who is dressed in a lounge suit with no jacket, smiling towards a cheering crowd. Crawford continues his oil painting, and the Queen smiles at him while seated for the portrait half in profile, wearing a white embroidered dress and a black velvet cloak ornamented with the star and shield of St. George's Cross. As she turns her head from the artist's formal pose, her expression barely changes. A lone pipo walks along a long colonnade at Buckingham Palace, with the royal standard flag gently ruffling in the gray skies above. The Queen lies in bed in a darkened room as a door opens behind her, and a woman enters to put a newspaper on a bedside table. The Queen looks at the paper. Later, the Queen sits at a desk with some corgis behind her as Robin enters. A black Jaguar car pulls to a stop in the palace courtyard, where a man in black coattails opens the rear door for Tony and Cherie Blair, who sit inside the car. The Blairs are ushered through a vast ornate hall by a man in a naval uniform, who smirks at Tony as he leads them toward an imposing set of closed doors. Cherie takes a seat by the doors as Tony is ushered into the room. The two men bow their heads to the Queen, standing in the middle of the room, and Tony shakes her hand. Tony waits for the Queen to be seated before sitting down opposite her. Cherie and the equerry are perched on chairs either side of the grand doors, and they both stand when Tony kneels at the Queen's gesture. The Queen extends her right hand to Tony, who takes it and kisses it. The Queen gestures for Tony to stand and picks up a small bell, and the equerry reenters with Cherie following behind him. Cherie curtsies before The Queen, who looks down and smiles at her, then Cherie shakes The Queen's hand. The Queen walks over to Robin and also shakes Cherie's and Tony's hands. Tony and Cherie back out of the room awkwardly while the Queen looks them up and down as they depart. On leaving, Tony and Cherie smile at the staff. A photo shows Diana and Dodi lounging, another shows Diana sitting alone on a diving board, and video footage shows Diana getting onto a small jet plane. Numerous television reporters are gathered in front of a hotel opposite an entrance with a revolving door, while a group of men on motorbikes wait by the back door.",
    "819": "Rows of old film studio buildings are reflected in a shiny gold surface. In a restaurant, the feet of a woman in high heels and a man in Brogues are seen under a table, while under other tables, another couple's feet are visible. A woman tentatively slides her foot forward and gently rubs it against a man's. More couples are nuzzling feet under various tables, as their feet slide towards each other magically. A man in running shoes and a woman in high heels sit with their feet far apart, studying their menus; the man, Cal, scratches his eye and glances at the woman, Emily, who is looking at the menu intently, while Cal gawks wide-eyed at her. Emily opens her mouth to speak but falters. Later, a girl in her late teens chases a younger girl through a house; the younger girl, Molly, dives onto a sofa, and the older girl tickles her. Molly knocks down a photo frame, runs off, and the glass cracks. The babysitter, Jessica, picks up the framed photo, examining it; it shows Emily with her arms wrapped around Cal's shoulders as they both smile happily. A wistful smile flickers across Jessica's face, and she gently places her hand over Emily in the photo to just see Cal. Emily and Cal drive back through the night in silence, and Emily glances at Cal awkwardly, opening and closing her mouth several times before speaking; she licks her lips anxiously and looks over at him as he stares ahead, Emily shaking her head. At home, Jessica flaps her hands in disgust, while Robbie, about 13, puts a pillow over his face. In the car, Cal stares ahead with a hard expression as Emily glances over at him, pursing her lips. Cal opens the door and listlessly tumbles from the moving car. Emily screeches to a halt, gets out, and races back to Cal, who sits hunched on the road. She stares at him incredulously and goes to help him up, but he gets up by himself and trudges towards the car. At the house, Jessica tidies the coffee table as Robbie enters, leans in an archway, nods ruefully, and looks upwards with a sigh; Jessica cringes and considers. Two young women are seen in a bar, where Liz looks at Hannah with concern as Hannah sags her shoulders and pouts. A guy in a maroon suit with smart, polished brown leather shoes strides confidently through the bar.",
    "1317": "Grandma rises from her chair with the assistance of her walker and begins to move toward Willie, wearing a bathrobe and thick glasses with another pair of glasses on a chain around her neck, while he watches as the senile old woman innocently putters away. He yanks off his mask and turns to the Kid, who shakes his head. The sound of a tumbler tripping is heard, and suddenly, light sweeps in as the safe door opens to reveal a smiling Willie with his stethoscope in his ears and, in the foreground, a few stacks of cash and a folio. Willie reaches in, grabs the folio, and flips through it. A new Mercedes screeches through the frame, and as it recedes, we are left looking at the Kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily, while Willie and Marcus walk to their cars. Opal looks at him with disdain and reluctantly sidles over. Willie is at a pay phone, and the Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. The Kid follows Willie like a puppy dog as Willie checks out the house, bumping open doors and looking around. Willie has discovered the master bedroom, which appears long unused, and he tosses his grip onto the double bed. Willie lies in the tub, motionless, with a wet washcloth over his face and the fingers of one hand resting against a tumbler filled with ice and amber liquid that sits on the edge of the tub. From under his washcloth, he drags the washcloth off his face and looks at the Kid, who looks at him unperturbed. She glances in as the person passes, and still chewing, gets out her notebook and jots something down. Willie stares at the board for a long beat, then leaps up screaming and flings the board across the room, while the Kid's face remains unfazed and still smiling. The kid lies in bed, sleeping peacefully as Willie bangs Sue in the Jacuzzi, wearing his Santa hat, while blearily, she gazes back. He closes the door, then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps. Ever so daintily, he puts the bottle down, and a beat later -- WHAM! -- he faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree. Willie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream, a bedroom door crashes open, and the Kid emerges screaming and runs right into Willie, immediately caroms off, and goes screaming down the hall, turning the corner to see a row of fresh, bloody palm-prints down one side of the hall while the Kid, screaming, is just disappearing at the far end.",
    "495": "Malcolm's hand with the tape recorder drops to his side as he stares into the night, standing alone as thoughts crash like thunder in his head. The front door opens, and Lynn carries Cole in, asleep on her shoulder. She carries him down the hall to his bedroom and gently lays him on his bed next to his German Shepherd puppy. Lynn watches the two youngsters sleep for a moment. Cole is curled up asleep with a tiny party hat clutched in his hands. Lynn has been carrying Cole's sweater from over her shoulder, and she pulls it off and begins to fold it. Her attention is drawn to the sweater as she fingers the fabric of the back, discovering it's ripped. Her eyes move to Cole, and in the middle of the back of his T-shirt are three small tears. Lynn pushes the fabric open with her fingers and sees deep fingernail-like scratches on his skin. Lynn looks around helplessly, fear creeping into her eyes, as the house seems threateningly still. An unnatural silence fills each room of the house, and the thermostat on the wall now reads fifty-two degrees. The door opens a crack, and Cole's tiny face peeks out, his eyes scanning the darkness. The door opens a little bit more, and Cole's knees are pressed together as his body dances a little—he has to pee. He moves cautiously into the hall and briskly to a door halfway down the corridor, turning on the light in the bathroom. He checks behind the shower curtain before he turns his back and pees into the toilet. Cole instantly stops peeing, and his body becomes very still as he slowly reaches for the toilet handle and flushes. He closes his pants and turns, just standing there and staring into the darkness of the hall, his breath forming tiny clouds in the cold air. Cole finally steps out into the hallway, and his eyes catch a slant of light now coming from the kitchen. He moves down the hall and turns the corner, coming to a stop in the doorway of the kitchen. Cole stares at the back of a person cooking food on the stove, and his fear slowly fades away. Suddenly, Cole's face turns the color of ash as he backs up to the doorway. The woman smiles menacingly as she thrusts her wrists forward, revealing they've been savagely cut. Cole turns and runs down the hall, across his room, and scurries in, his legs disappearing as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. The crazed woman stands at the end of the hall while Cole is curled up in the tent, the red interior of the tent gets lit up, and the bedsheet walls of the tent are lined with religious pictures taped to the walls.",
    "777": "Wilson puts his hand on Adrian's shoulder, and they hold each other's gaze. Smoke fills the sky above Las Vegas as buildings burn by a deep chasm through town. A light plane approaches McAllen airport as the runway crumbles into the chasm, and they land on a chaotic runway. Twins Alec and Oleg are with Yuri and Tamara by the grounded plane as the mechanic runs off. The fireman forces Yuri to move. A limo pulls up by Air Force One, and Adrian gets out. On board, Anheuser hangs up his cell phone in the busy control room lined with computer equipment and terminals. Adrian enters and stands before Anheuser, who tries to read his expression, as the staff onboard stop what they're doing. Adrian stares forlornly as Anheuser walks off. Air Force One taxis along the runway, and on board, Laura comes out of the president's cabin as a steward approaches. Laura goes into the cabin and picks up the phone. She leans against the wall, and as she sobs, a light goes out behind Wilson. His secretary, Sally, stands in the doorway, and he lowers the phone from his ear. Air Force One takes off, and Wilson sits before a TV camera in the office as the broadcast fades. Everyone turns, and the fireman's face falls as he shuts the glass door, which reflects the fast-approaching ash cloud. Sasha leads Jackson and the others to a cargo plane, an Antonov, and they board. The lights come on in the cargo hold, revealing it is full of gleaming sports cars. Sasha does it for him as the Antonov taxis into position while the ash cloud billows across the airport, engulfing the control tower. The Antonov loses a tire as they approach the runway's damaged end, and the plane drops into the chasm. Onboard, Yuri holds his sons to their seats as Tamara touches Caesar. Two buildings appear ahead, and Gordon pilots them between the buildings. The plane's wide wings narrowly scrape through and they rise. Control shakes their hands as they clear another building, and Gordon gawps as they drive towards a tall tower, taking the tip off with the plane's underside. Jackson pats Noah's hand, and Kate hugs Lilly. In Tibet, Nima and Lama Rinpoche sit together on the balcony of a small monastery overlooking a snow-covered mountain range. Lama Rinpoche looks calmly at Nema and pours out some tea for both of them, filling Nema's cup until it overflows. Nema reaches out to stop him from pouring, and Rinpoche stops. A breeze blows across the balcony, and prayer flags hanging from the eaves of the roof billow. Rinpoche holds something up and tosses it to Nema, who catches it. It is a truck key, and Nema grins at the key, then at Rinpoche.",
    "1336": "Valjean comes out of the church into the graveyard and reaches a bell set on the edge of a promontory. He rips the yellow paper into pieces and throws the pieces out over the valley. We follow the scraps of yellow paper as they dance in the wind, then fall away into the void below. The scraps flutter in the wind. Below lies the steep drop down the mountainside to the dark valley. We follow this and accelerate upwards, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far below, towards the sun breaking through the heavens with the alps beyond. One scrap of paper dances upwards in the sunlight. The camera then starts to tumble back down through mist and cloud below, through time and space, down to discover ships sitting in low tide on the mud of the estuary along the dockside of the town and red brick factory buildings. The camera hurtles towards three horses riding down a long muddy road on a flat plain towards the walled town of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Montreuil sits on an estuary leading out to the sea. As the riders enter the walled town, we see the poor clustered around the gates, destitute and sick people clammering to get in. Javert sees the destitution of the people, expressionless as ever. The police enter the harbour, and the beggars are pushed back as the gates open and close for the police. The long workspace is full of tables at which conservatively dressed women are working, making jewelry out of shellac, a black resin which looks like jet. The Foreman has stopped beside Fantine, a pretty young woman. As he leans over to whisper in her ear, Fantine, surprised, pricks her finger with her needle. The women start to take off their overalls and pack up their tools for the day. Fantine has taken out a letter. The main factory woman snatches the letter away from Fantine. Fantine tries to get the letter back. The letter is passed surreptitiously down the line of women workers. The main factory woman starts to take Fantine's letter over to the Foreman. The women scuffle. The owner enters the factory floor. Clean-shaven, well-fed, transformed: it's Valjean. Suddenly, Valjean sees Javert appear on the first-floor balcony of his office. His world drops away. On the factory floor, Fantine continues to defend herself to the Foreman, as the women sing. The Foreman pulls Fantine away. Below, Fantine turns and calls to Valjean in his office above with a pitiful cry. Valjean walks back to the stairs up to his office and shows some demonstration samples of their work, throwing a sharp glance.",
    "853": "The man talks to Estevez, then he drops them. He stares at the cops and complies as Estevez steps up to cuff him, but is spun around and used as a shield. Burton convulses and dances on the spot as they shake. Lights flicker, and his eyes are staring with a tight face. Burton shoots Estevez. Michael leaps to the ground, moves over, and shoots Burton with two handguns. Michael places his two guns in the bags, takes them to the police car, and drives off in it. Burton's body lies on the sidewalk. The squad car, identified by the number 1127 on its roof, drives past buildings with lights shutting off as he passes. A guy in his late 20s wakes with a start, looks around, switches on a light, and is on a chair. A small television is to his left. He comes out of a two-door trailer, shuts the door, and in the early morning light, walks away from the big gray trailer, passing under two strings of light bulbs with his hands stuffed in his jacket pockets. The green neon lights of the sign illuminate his features. Jeep turns back to the trailer, and she is pregnant. They sit on the swings facing in opposite directions, Charlie's belly very swollen, and Jeep wears a hangdog expression. He nods, she stares at him out of the corner of her eyes, then looks away. She rises from the swing, walks behind him, resting her hand momentarily on his shoulder before continuing on her way back to the trailer. He remains on the swing and doesn't move as she goes back inside through the second door. Jeep's father, Bob, keeps thumping the TV set inside the Paradise Falls diner and plays with a lighter. His chef is a tall, bald black guy who wears a crucifix and a couple of dog tags around his neck and has a hook for a left hand. A skimpily dressed young woman leans over a jukebox, and a woman at a table with a man stares at her and grunts. The man glances round and makes a move. Bob turns, as does Audrey, and Howard turns to wife Sandra. A guy in an SUV drives along a deserted freeway with a half-smoked cigarette in his mouth, wearing a brown beanie hat, a scarf around his neck, and a casual jacket. It's a sunny morning as he stubs out his cigarette, picks up his cellphone, and looks at it. He sees a sign for Paradise Falls, unfolds a map to study it, then lowers it and sees the diner up ahead. He pulls up in the forecourt and sees Charlie standing by a phone box, smoking a cigarette.",
    "96": "He sets Tex down on the bank of a river and runs back into the jungle. Forrest drops another wounded soldier down at the bank of the river next to Tex and then runs back toward the jungle.

Dan grabs Forrest by the shirt, angry. Forrest gets up and runs as Lt. Dan yells after him. Forrest runs through the jungle searching for Bubba. Forrest slows down and looks around carefully. Bubba looks up as he lies on the ground. Bubba holds a palm frond over his wound. Forrest removes the frond to look at the wound. Bubba's chest has been blown open. Forrest looks around as he hears the voices of the enemy. Forrest carries Bubba through the jungle. The sound of approaching planes fills the air. The roar of approaching planes is deafening. Forrest looks up in fear. Three planes dive down toward the jungle. They fire napalm as the jungle explodes with massive fireballs. Forrest runs, carrying Bubba. The fireballs explode behind him. The entire jungle area is in flames as Forrest runs. Forrest carries Bubba to the bank of the river. Lt. Dan and the other wounded soldiers wait for a rescue helicopter. Forrest looks down at Bubba.

Another nurse wheels the rolling bed under Lt. Dan. The male nurse sets Lt. Dan down on the rolling bed. A soldier reads the names from a pile of letters. Forrest looks up at Lt. Dan as he is wheeled away. The soldier hands Forrest a large pile of letters. Forrest looks down at the pile of letters.",
    "375": "He's not just handsome, not just charming, as if all the forces of the natural world had conspired to create him. Suddenly, this Edward thrusts both hands into the water, grabbing hold of a catfish and bringing it up to his face, looking it right in the eye. After a beat, the Beast spits out Edward's gold ring. Over the sound of rain, a phone rings on a chair, and by the tone, it is clear we're not in the U.S. -- it has that insistent European sound. As it keeps ringing, the mostly empty apartment is seen, with just a few half-unpacked boxes and a cradle still in its carton. Keys are in the lock, followed by laughter in the hallway as the door swings open to reveal a drenched Will, carrying four sacks of groceries with collapsing bottoms from the rain. His wife Josephine pushes past him to get the phone and hands it to Will, concerned. Half-stripped, Will takes the phone, realizing this won't be good news. He covers the mouthpiece and looks over to Josephine. Will has a window seat in coach with Josephine beside him, putting on hand lotion. Hours later, the lights are dimmed, and most of the passengers are asleep, including Josephine, whose head is propped against Will's shoulder with her hands tucked under her belly. A beat passes, and Will notices a bored boy in the next row using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back under the reading light, making a convincing bird, passable monkey, and finally a dog. Focusing on the final shadow, Edward is seen making the shapes as a young Will sits in his pajamas on the floor next to him, the endtable lamp lying between them with its shade off to cast big shadows on the wall. Edward looks around for a beat to see if his wife is in earshot, then leans in, complicitous, as Will smiles, excited to hear the forbidden story. Edward holds up his hand, counting names on his fingers, as his hand moves past the light, and a flashlight sweeps by. The night is whirring and breathing, alive, with the moon hanging low, casting long shadows. Five kids walk past in silhouette, four with flashlights on, while the fifth keeps tripping, crashing into young Edward. Moving up behind the kids, they stand at the gates, staring in through the gate. Edward looks back at the spooky house, hands Zacky his flashlight, and starts climbing the gate, dropping down on the far side. Truth be told, Edward is scared, but he forges ahead anyway.",
    "1084": "Later, they are on the march again, with Viktor and Gramov leading the way on horseback, and Zus and all the rest of the soldiers following on foot. In the camp, Tuvia is in his cabin struggling with a fever, while outside, people are patiently in the food queue. Arkady and his friend are sharing a joke. Aron runs up to his brother's cabin as Chaya brings plates full of food to Arkady's table. Tuvia appears and notices Asael's black eye. Asael looks over to Arkady, who's standing with his back to them both, tucking into his large portion of food. Arkady pretends not to hear, takes another spoonful, then slowly hands his plate to a cohort and turns towards Tuvia with an insolent scowl. Arkady glances around at the fearful expressions of the rest of the people. Tuvia looks at him in disbelief, and Asael drops his head in shame. Tuvia turns round to face the community, Arkady behind him, smirking. Tuvia spins around and shoots him point-blank, and points his gun at Arkady's cohort, then lowers the gun. Asael swallows nervously as the men at the table jump to their feet and bend down to carry off Arkady's lifeless body. They carry him away past Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel. Tuvia, with his two younger brothers near him, looks defiantly at the silent huddle of people watching him. Later, he lies in bed, and a blanket is pulled up over him. His eyes flicker open, and he sees Lilka looking down at him. She smiles softly, and his face lights up for a brief moment before his eyes shut. She sits down in a chair near to the bed to watch him as a ray of sunshine bathes the log cabin in soft golden light. Tuvia, armed with his machine gun, is on an early morning watch. Asael unhooks a curtain from his cabin window and peers out. Icicles are beginning to thaw as Lilka stands with her face raised towards the sun, luxuriating in its warmth. Tuvia treads through the softening snow and wanders off into the hazy sunshine. A camera lens is set on a tripod, and the whole Bielski camp assembles for a group photograph. Some of the women are washing in the creek as Bella splashes Chaya. Tamara, huddled in her black coat despite the sunshine, looks nervous and frightened. Lilka steps out of the water to meet her. Tamara glances around, then takes Lilka by the hand and leads her out of the earshot of the others. She opens her coat and touches her belly. Lilka's clear blue eyes look searchingly at Tamara, whose face crumples. Lilka gently squeezes Tamara's clasped hands as Tuvia comes down through some trees, his gun held loosely in his hand.",
    "1111": "They are swarming into it as Ron looks around nervously. Harry stoops and goes into the tunnel with Fang just ahead, and breathing hard, Ron hesitates for a moment then follows his friend. The tunnel lies dark and glow, making it impossible to stand upright. They do not see a very large spider which drops from the roof behind them, silhouetted against the light from the tunnel entrance. The tunnel gradually opens out into a large dimly lit hollow filled with twisted tree roots; Harry and Ron follow the spiders as they swarm across it. But the path stops at a huge hole in the ground surrounded by crumpled cobwebs. The guide disappeared into the hole, and unable to go further, the boys stopped a little away from it. Harry holds up the lantern, unsure of what to do next, and Harry and Ron back away as several long hairy legs emerge from the hole, and a huge spider as big as a double-decker bus holds itself above the edge and peers down at them. It has a hairy face and its tiny eyes are set close together, and the boys stare open-mouthed as Ron stops whimpering. Ron points upwards with a shaking hand, and Harry looks up to see dozens of large spiders lowering themselves from the tree roots to dangle about their heads. He nods politely to Aragog, and Harry swings the lantern but drops it. They pull out their wands as the spiders close in. It's the Ford Anglia, and it stops with the doors flying open. Fang jumps into the back seat, Ron into the front, and Harry dives for the passenger seat as the spiders attack. Scattering spiders, Ron backs the car out around the tree roots and back along the narrow tunnel. The car hurtles backwards out of the entrance and flies through the air. The car hits the ground and comes to a halt, dislodging the lost spider, which grabs Ron through the open window. Harry points his wand and the spider is hurled backwards, and Ron looks at Harry with relief. Harry's eyes suddenly open wide as he looks through the cracked windscreen to see hundreds of huge spiders appearing from amongst the shadowy trees and moving towards the car, ready to attack again. Ron starts the car, puts it into reverse, turns the car, and accelerates. The spiders scuttle close behind the car as it jolts away between the trees, and the floor of the forest is a seething mass of spiders. Harry turns to Ron in desperation as Ron grabs the gear stick, while spiders lurk in the trees ready to jump on the car. Huge spiders loom ahead of them as they both heave on the gear stick, and the car rises into the air, smashing into a branch and scattering spiders.",
    "857": "He's tall and thin with a gaunt face, wearing a light shirt and dark floppy bow tie, with matching light trousers. He steps to the front of the van, his headlights still on, and moves forward. Bob watches as the ice cream man sniffs the air. The man opens his mouth as his arms extend from his sleeves. He bends over and bounds like a stick insect, and as he leaps in the air, Michael shoots him. As the man arrives on the ground, Michael continues shooting until the twitching stops. Inside the diner, the women and Jeep look anxious. Up on the roof, they turn their heads right to look along the road and see lights, as two columns of cars bear down on them. The cars drive straight as if on tracks, and inside, their drivers seem to be convulsing, their heads shaking violently as they drive towards the diner. As bullets rip into the lead cars, they spin on the road, and shells cascade along the feet of the shooters. One car smashes into a static one, rolling over in flames as the bursts of rapid fire illuminate the faces on the roof. Michael runs along the walkway and sees lights coming from the other direction, with a new convoy led by a villain car, then a truck. Michael launches a grenade, taking out the lead vehicle, then opens fire on the truck, which spills some of its load of pipes and slams into other cars. The surviving vehicles stop, and their doors open as drivers and passengers emerge from them and walk sedately towards the diner. From the roof, the guys look down on the approaching hoard of impassive faces. Kyle sees a young girl in a white party dress holding a balloon, noting there are men, women, and children, and she seems to be looking straight up at him. Michael opens fire, and people go down as shells fall from the rifles. In the diner, Jeep anxiously moves the torch around, while his father guns down several of the approaching people. Michael moves away from the other three as Sandra and Audrey are beside Howard, who is on the floor. Charlie's eyes are fixed on the window above the desk in the office, and someone bursts through. They can't see the intruder as Charlie rises from behind the counter and Howard yells, being dragged by the legs by the intruder, who hauls him towards the shattered window. The woman intruder, her young face contorted, leaps out of the window, still pulling Howard as the others try to keep hold of him. Her arm is grabbed, and as the stranger cuts Charlie, a knife cuts through his wrist, severing his hand. Michael is inside as Howard is pulled out, and assault rifle in each hand, Michael shoots out of the window.",
    "60": "Gittes is clicking off more shots when the tiles his feet are hooked over come loose, leading to a slow slide down the tile to the edge of the roof and possibly over it to a three-story drop. The loose tile also begins to slide, and a fragment off the cracked edge of the tile falls. Gittes tries to slow himself down as Mulwray stares at the fragment at his feet, rises, looks up to the roof, and then at the girl. In the style of the Hearst yellow press, there is a heart-shaped drawing around one of the photos that Gittes had taken, bringing a self-satisfied smile to his face. Elsewhere, a car is stalled with the hood up, as a man watches his radiator boiling over, reading a paper while getting a haircut and his shoes shined. Almost all the customers are reading papers. Gittes straightens up and gets out of the chair, despite Barney's concern as he tries to restrain him by holding onto the barber sheet around Gittes' neck. A customer shrinks back into the chair as Gittes bursts in, slapping a newspaper on his thigh. She gets up and leaves, while Walsh comes out of his office and Duffy out of the other one. A stunning young woman appears behind Gittes in his doorway, soon joined by a small, gray-haired man, as they listen unseen by Gittes, who laughs and then is staggered. When Gittes looks up, he sees the young woman, apparently in her late twenties, so stunning that he nearly gasps as the gray-haired man winces. The young woman walks past him toward the door. Evelyn starts out the door, and Gittes starts after her but is stopped by the gray-haired man who has also come out of his office and up behind him. Gittes stares down at the papers in his hand and turns to be handed a thick sheaf of papers, a summons and complaint. The Secretary half rises in protest but Gittes is through the inner door, where the walls are covered with commendations, photos of Mulwray at various construction sites, and large maps of watershed areas and reservoirs in the city. On the desk is a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding clothes. Gittes moves to the desk, watching the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office as he does so. He begins to open and close the desk drawers after quickly examining the top, reopens the top drawer, and the bottom one opens. He looks in it, pulls out a checkbook, and opens it to riffle through the stubs like he was shuffling cards.",
    "903": "Dillinger scans the hillside but finds no sign of anyone, as Red peers over his shoulder from his tree. Dillinger relaxes his aim, and both men start off while Winstead lies low behind a tree. In slow motion, the criminals run along the misty overlook with Red leading the way as Agent Hurt opens fire from uphill, bringing Red down. Dillinger urges Red to his feet, and they move on. Behind them, Winstead resumes tracking the pair. Dillinger accosts an average man standing outside a cabin. Later, Red clutches his side, and Dillinger opens the heisted car's door for him. Baby Face reaches an unpaved road, where Baum, driving a car, peers ahead over the steering wheel. Baby Face turns his back to the vehicle as its glaring headlights draw closer and waves a hand low, paces backward, and keeps his Tommy gun under his coat. Baum stops and climbs out the other door. Baby Face throws him down and tosses Baum's Tommy gun onto the front seat before getting behind the wheel. As Baum's car drives off, Purvis comes running through the forest, finds his fallen partner, doffs his hat, crouches down to his fading colleague, glaring after the car riding steadily away, and moves out. Agent Madala follows, hesitating upon seeing Baum's body. On the dirt road, Purvis aims loosely at an oncoming car while holding up one hand; it's Cowley's team. Cowley pulls a 180, and Purvis rides outside the vehicle on the passenger side running board, armed with his Tommy gun. Baby Face comes upon Homer and Shouse, who aim their guns at the Ford as Cowley's speeding car takes a tight turn, and Purvis scowls into the night as the car follows another curve. Their headlights reveal a dip in the road, then the stolen Ford climbing the rise farther ahead, prompting Purvis to fire. Homer returns fire as Baby Face swerves to avoid incoming shots, and Purvis fires relentlessly from Cowley's car as it gains on Baby Face. Homer loads his next round, with a curve in the road giving Purvis an angled shot. Shouse nervously wipes his nose as Purvis tags the Ford's hood, causing the Ford to careen into a field and roll twice before settling on its tires. Shouse's lifeless face leans on the cracked windshield. Homer leaves Baby Face stuck behind the jammed front door, but the paunchy gangster kicks it out. Purvis arrives and riddles Homer with bullets, with puffs of redness erupting repeatedly from the gangster’s chest. Making an escape, Baby Face nails Cowley, leading Purvis to take aim with a pistol, but Agent Madala fires a shotgun first. Purvis follows up with shots of his own, and the paunchy gangster goes down as Baby Face half recovers, getting to his knees and discharges Tommy rounds.",
    "924": "He changes direction. The underground chase is as furious as the race above. Mitchell crashes through some supports. The roof starts to cave in on Bond. The crowds cheer enthusiastically. Mitchell's on a ladder to the surface as Bond picks himself up and keeps going. Fireworks signify that the race has a winner. The track is invaded. Amidst the tears and celebrations, Bond emerges from a manhole. Mitchell barges his way through the throng. Bond follows. He fires towards Bond, hitting a woman, then scrambles over a barrier onto the racetrack. 007 sprints in pursuit. The chase moves through a courtyard, then through a door and upstairs. Mitchell barges into an elderly woman lifting a crate of fruit on a rope. The crate crashes to the ground. Mitchell leaps across tiled rooftops, his pursuer following relentlessly. He takes a massive leap between buildings. Cluster around the shot civilian. A round strikes nearby as Bond leaps. He lands, slides down the tiles, then jumps again, landing heavily on a ledge. His quarry is on a roof across from and above him. He jumps down onto a balcony, leaps onto another, and holds himself up on the metal railings. He bursts into a room, runs through the apartment, and sees Mitchell climbing onto another roof a short distance away. He jumps from a window onto the roof of a bus. He gets to his feet and jumps from the vehicle onto another ledge, then shins off a drainpipe. Face set grimly, he's now on the same roof as his target. Mitchell arrives at the top of an empty tower. He leaps for a flight of steps dislodging recently. Bond follows and fires as the double agent runs out of sight. Bond pulls on the bell ropes, then heads up to the belfry, gun up and ready. Mitchell attacks from a perch outside the tower. Bond grabs his arm and hits out with an elbow. Both fall through a glass roof and onto a scaffold beneath. Bond's gun falls to the floor far below. Hanging by one hand, Bond tries to pull down the scaffolding beneath his adversary. Mitchell falls but grabs onto a rope. It swings, knocking over a pane of glass which shatters, sending vicious shards raining down. The rope gantry swings and the crate of bricks falls from the other end. Bond also grabs a rope. The two men end up facing each other, dangling on ropes at either end of the steel gantry. They trade blows and smash into a scaffold which topples over, pulling on the rope, hauling them into the glass roof. Mitchell falls onto the scaffold. Leg caught in a rope, Bond plummets, but is stopped just before hitting the ground near the gun.",
    "377": "Will walks towards the door, running a hand along the wallpaper, and almost at the door, he stops for a beat to catch his breath before going inside. Inside, Edward Bloom, 61, lies asleep on the bed. Although not as vibrant as before, his condition is not worse than expected; the illness has been quick but left him largely intact, with no I.V.s or monitors in sight. Will approaches the bed as Edward cracks open an eye, struggling to focus. Edward tries to speak, but no words come out, so he glances at a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours him a glass of water and helps him drink. There is a long, tense pause, and as Will almost speaks to break the silence, he remembers the can of Ensure, which he holds up. Edward recoils at the sight of it but then rolls his eyes. Will opens the can, finds a straw, and Edward drinks as much Ensure as he can stand before pushing the can away, swallowing with difficulty. Will does not commit to Edward's unspoken assessment, prompting Edward to laugh a little, which turns into a cough. The coughing escalates until another drink of water calms it. Will takes the half-empty Ensure and stands to leave. Before exiting, he smiles at his joke, shuts the door behind himself, and drinks the remainder of the Ensure, finding it tastes horrible. As he heads for the stairs, Will walks past an open door, leaving the frame as we stay behind to see an eight-year-old Will, face covered with chicken pox and calamine lotion, sitting in bed. The young Will sings, his voice high and thin, until it cracks and drops, leaving him embarrassed as he continues singing, struggling to follow the baritone part. As he sings, Edward, undoes his collar, which pops off, followed by two more buttons, one hitting a chubby woman in the neck. We watch as Edward’s pant cuffs rise quickly, indicative of his rapid growth. Young Edward lies in bed, limbs and weight supported by pulleys and levers, surrounded by dozens of encyclopedias. He considers an encyclopedia article, already adorned with drawings, when the crack of a bat signals a game-winning home run. The crowd cheers as the batter, presumably Edward, rounds the bases. This scene marks our first real encounter with grown-up Edward, whom we will follow from the ages of 18 to 30.",
    "1000": "Jordan gives Nick a bemused look and goes in search of Gatsby as Nick stands frowning, captivated by the dazzling firework display unfolding before everyone else. From his upstairs window, Gatsby watches, reflecting sparkles in the glass, as fireworks shoot up into the night sky like a thousand silver stars, while Jordan glides across the confetti-covered dance floor and ascends the stairs. As she walks through double doors at the top of the stairs, Nick continues to frown, his back turned to the fireworks, while Gatsby stands at the window, smiling benignly and smoking a cigarette. Nick eventually turns to look at the spectacular display, observing as twinkling specks of light drift down like snowflakes and shimmering golden flakes flow from a giant champagne bottle, floating down on guests who are relaxing in a lounge with cushions scattered on the floor. Nick lies back, looking dreamy and gazes up at the photos and paintings on the walls. As a barman clears up, Nick stands and looks around thoughtfully, noticing a woman draped across the piano. Jordan appears with Teddy in tow, and they are driven away as Gatsby watches from the top of the steps, pressing his lips together thoughtfully. He then smiles politely and leaves as people cavort by the fountain. As Jordan is driven by, she stands up and waves, prompting Nick to smile and wave back. Nick walks along the dimly lit driveway to his cottage, stopping to look back at Gatsby's mansion. Watching from the upstairs window, Gatsby lowers a telephone and waves, with Nick waving back. Standing with a painting of charging stags behind him, Gatsby smiles charmingly, but when Nick's back is turned, his smile fades, and he lifts the telephone to his ear. Nick sits in his cottage, reading, but at the sound of an engine, he frowns, gets up, and peers out the window, spotting Gatsby circling the cottage in a bright-yellow Duesenberg coupe. The car, featuring white-wall tires and four chrome side pipes curled down from the engine, prompts Nick to come out and do up his dressing gown. Nick sits nervously in the passenger seat as Gatsby speeds along a country road in the Duesenberg, weaving through traffic. Gatsby smiles, patting his hand against his leg, looking at Nick while overtaking and cornering sharply, nearly hitting a pedestrian. Holding up his business card to a motorcycle cop riding alongside them, the cop peels off to the right, and Gatsby smiles. They head toward the Queensboro Bridge, driving alongside a convertible with a white chauffeur and two black couples in the back drinking champagne, and Nick looks bemused. They enter a barber shop, where a distinguished man with gray hair, beard, and mustache sits, and Gatsby taps a wall.",
    "231": "Gebczynski comes up behind him, and he closes the cupboard. Gebczynski makes for the front door, stops, hands over a scrap of paper, shakes Szpilman's hand, and goes quickly. Alone, Szpilman stands, lost for a moment, then takes off his shoe and stuffs the scrap of paper into it. While he does so, his eyes light on the divan bed, and he goes to it, slips off his other shoe, and lies down, testing the divan's springiness with his whole body, then smiles beatifically. He shuts his eyes and is instantly asleep. Szpilman is still fast asleep, but voices wake him, and he opens his eyes. He's not certain where he is for a moment but hears the voices again, coming from the adjoining flat. Intrigued, he rises, goes closer to the wall, puts his ear against it, and listens. Szpilman is enjoying himself, then the sound of a piano being played with great feeling but a lot of wrong notes comes. The piano continues for a moment but suddenly stops, and a door slams. She hands him the parcel, and he goes into the small kitchen and unpacks the contents while Janina gazes out of the window. She turns to look again out of the window at the building burning, corpses lie scattered on the pavement, Germans stand about chatting and laughing, and a handful of Jewish fighters are lined up and shot. Blazing sun. The ghetto buildings are now burned-out shells, the street empty, autumn leaves falling and gusting in the wind. Szpilman gazes out. Snow. Ice on the windows and the sound of the key in the door. Szpilman turns as the door opens, and Gebczynski enters, distraught, whispered, at speed. Gebczynski takes out a cigarette and lights it. While he does so, he goes, and Szpilman listens to his footsteps clattering down the stairs. He sees the cigarette stub, takes it, lights it, coughs, and smokes awkwardly. Szpilman hears a car engine and the screech of brakes and tenses. German voices shout and their heavy footsteps on the stairs. He goes to the window, opens it, and gets a chair, places it sideways in front of the window to make a step, working out how best to throw himself out. He leans against the wall near the door and waits. Slamming of doors, German shouts, a scream, and Szpilman steels himself, ready to jump. Again footsteps on the stairs, but this time descending, and a door slams. He cautiously goes to the window and looks out. In the street below, he sees SS men escorting two prisoners and shoving them into a car, which then speeds off. The street is empty. Snow. Howling wind. Szpilman lies on the divan, cold, unshaven, hair filthy and long. He manages to rise.",
    "882": "A lady's hand works on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Two horses charge across the English countryside, and their riders stop at a vantage point to observe a sizable mansion nestled between trees in the distance. Mr. Bingley, with a broad smile, rides toward his new property, accompanied by Mr. Darcy. A young woman, Elizabeth Bennet, watches from a distance as the two horses thunder across the fields, turns away from the scene up on the hillside, a smile playing on her lips. Wearing a straw bonnet and simple day dress, Lizzie sets off down a country lane, turns while walking to take in the green and earthy countryside before breaking into a canter. After picking a posy of wildflowers from the woods, Lizzie crosses a small field where a chestnut mare and her foal graze in the sunshine and walks on toward the village beyond. Approaching her house, Longbourn, she bypasses the entrance, hearing her sisters arguing inside, and peers into her father's study. Father and daughter roll their eyes and smile. Lydia dons Kitty's bonnet, and Kitty bolts from the room in tears, passing Jane in the hall. Outside church, Mrs. Bennet is in deep conversation with a neighbor, while her five daughters set off behind their father. Mrs. Bennet manages to extract herself and runs to catch up with them. Mr. Bennet strides ahead into the house, setting down his hat and cane, as a maid rushes to attend Mrs. Bennet. Lizzie and Jane can't help smiling, and Lydia rolls her eyes. Later, Jane sits at her dressing table, brushing through her long, flaxen hair by candlelight, with a wistful Lizzie sitting behind her. Lizzie kisses Jane on the head and walks out of the room, closing her bedroom door behind her. Meanwhile, downstairs, Mr. Bennet works late in his study, poring over household accounts, marking up a book, putting his quill back in its pot, wearily shaking his head, and sitting back in his chair. With a sly look to the side, he reaches for a drinks decanter. Upstairs, Lizzie leans on her dressing table, studying her reflection, practices some facial expressions, smiles, and finally blows out the candle. As people mill around on the main street, a grand carriage pulls up outside The Assembly Rooms, led by men bearing torches. A servant opens the door and holds down the carriage steps. Bingley alights first, smiles at his surroundings, and puts on his large Napoleonic-style hat. Looking a little more serious, Darcy comes next, followed by Miss Bingley, wearing a grand ball gown and feather hat.",
    "545": "Henry presses against the wall, which rotates again. As he disappears into the next room, a dead Nazi radioman swivels into the room, and the other Nazis rush forward to him. Indy picks up a bust of Hitler and uses it to jam the rotating wall in place, sealing the Nazis inside the burning room. Vogel strides purposefully down the hallway and barks an order, causing two more Nazis to fall into step with him. Indy grabs his whip, leather sack, and Henry's case from a table, hands the case to Henry, and they begin to run. Indy and Henry step into an empty room, and Henry looks horrified by what he's been forced to do as Indy searches frantically for an exit. Indy begins to run his hands over the walls with urgency. Henry sits on a chair that tips back, hitting the wall behind it, causing the floor at Indy's feet to suddenly drop away. Indy grabs a railing to keep from falling but loses his grip and plunges through the opening, forming a spiral staircase. He rolls down the stairs, and Henry follows Indy down the staircase. The stairway deposits Indy and Henry into an enormous watery cavern beneath the mountain on which the castle was built, where a full-scale Nazi boat dock has been constructed. Indy boards one of the motorboats and starts the motor. Henry tosses his case at Indy, who catches it and angrily throws it back to his father. Indy moves back to the dock and pushes the boat away, and Henry looks confused. Vogel and the Nazi soldiers enter the room, spot the spiral staircase leading below, and quickly descend the stairs. As Vogel and the Nazi soldiers rush to the dock, Vogel sees that a motorboat is missing and orders the Nazi soldiers into a boat. The motorbike skids to a stop, and Henry slaps him across the face. Arrows point in opposite directions to Venice and Berlin, and the camera moves in on the portion of the sign reading Berlin. A Nazi rally is in process, with a book-burning occurring. The mound of burning books is ten feet tall and growing as college students and Nazi brownshirts continually toss more books onto the fire. Flags, banners, and standards displaying the swastika are waved rhythmically, echoing the mounting frenzy of the enormous crowd. Indy and Henry walk toward the square, with Indy wearing the uniform of a Nazi soldier and buttoning up the tunic, which happens to be several sizes too big. High-ranking officers of the Third Reich flank Adolf Hitler as they oversee the rally.",
    "986": "Queenie turns the baby towards the old woman, and the baby chuckles. Tizzy enters Queenie's sparse basement room, and she looks at him from the bed. He takes off his suit jacket and stares at Benjamin, who lies in the drawer at Queenie's bedside. Tizzy sits down on the bed, and Queenie glares at him, raises her brows, and stares at him. She wears a white nightdress. Tizzy looks away, picks up his jacket, and starts for the door. He pauses and removes his spectacles, putting them on the dresser. He throws his black jacket over the steel bed frame and sits close to Queenie. Benjamin stirs in his makeshift cot, and Tizzy and Queenie put an arm around each other, their eyes meeting. She leans forward and kisses him tenderly on the lips, and he cups her neck as they sink down onto the bed while kissing. As a child, Benjamin resembles a bald, old man. At a dining table, Benjamin uses an ear trumpet and wears round glasses with wispy, white hair around the sides of his shiny, bald head. He pushes himself back and forth along a porch in his wheelchair, but an elderly resident wedges his walking stick between Benjamin's wooden spokes to stop him. The old man retracts the stick, and Benjamin wheels himself to the top of the front steps to watch children playing in the street, his wheels drawing closer to the top step. He lies at Queenie's bedside and clasps her hand as Tizzy enters the room. Tizzy climbs the stairs, carrying frail, child-sized Benjamin in his arms. Benjamin sits in his wheelchair in the empty lounge beside an elderly woman who sleeps in a chair in the corner of the dark, wood-paneled room. Benjamin wheels himself to the glass-paned double front doors, stands up, peers out, and breathes against the glass before his legs suddenly give way beneath him, and he collapses. A naked old man raises a flag up a flagpole in the rain outside. A white-haired old woman with scarlet lipstick, while Queenie bathes Benjamin with the bathroom door wide open and tries to straighten his stiff, right leg. Tizzy washes up next to a large marquee. Benjamin dozes in a wicker-backed wheelchair, but Queenie wakes him and rises primly to her feet. She is approached by women in white uniforms and nurses' hats, while the preacher in a suit stands nearby. Queenie, wearing a pale orange dress, places her purse beside Benjamin and whispers something to the bespectacled preacher, who puts an arm around her and looks at the congregation. The mustachioed preacher puts a hand on Queenie's belly and pushes her into the arms of the nurses, she gets back on her feet, and the preacher removes Benjamin's boater, staring at him.",
    "659": "As the door opens, Harry enters, clutching a bouquet of flowers, and MJ quickly pulls her hand away from Peter's. Harry stares at them with a disappointed look on his face, and the three of them appear awkward. That evening, Harry strides into the dimly lit, arched Osborne living room. Hearing voices, he moves towards the stairs and climbs the grand staircase. His father, Norman, appears on the landing which encircles the room. Harry spreads his arms wide as Norman leans on the wood-carved rail, looking down and shaking his head at his son, who continues up the stairs sullenly. Harry looks at his father quizzically, and Norman steps down to him, then wraps him in his arms. Harry closes his eyes as tears well up in them. Peter rests his head on his aunt's bed, looking coy and thoughtful before turning away in alarm as he stands at a pay phone in the hospital. His eyes widen upon seeing MJ unconscious, a stiff breeze ruffling her hair and nightclothes, which rouses her. MJ gets to her feet on a metal platform high above the city lights, steps back to the edge, and manages to keep her balance. Way below her, traffic moves across the Queensboro Bridge as she stands on one of the towers of the steel structure. The Green Goblin approaches and glides over the ducking MJ, who watches him move towards a cable car filled with children and adults. The Green Goblin shoots a missile, destroying the cable-car station, and motor cars on the bridge collide. From a nearby rooftop, Spider-Man observes the chaos as a massive metal wheel flies into the air, a cable whips free, and the Roosevelt Island cable car begins to fall. The Green Goblin grabs the cable, stabilizing the car, as Spider-Man, standing on a thick strand of web tied between two flagpoles, launches himself into the air by walking down a building. He shoots webs, maneuvering along the steel girders until he lands on a metal strut. Above him, the Goblin holds MJ in one hand and the cable-car cable in the other, lifting MJ as her slippers slip off. The cable car swings in the wind, suspended solely by the Goblin's grip. The Goblin releases both MJ and the cable simultaneously. In the reflections of the large spider eyes on Spider-Man's mask, one shows MJ falling and the other the cable car full of screaming, frightened children. Spider-Man runs along the girder, leaps to catch MJ, and then swings beneath the span to ensnare the cable car in his web.",
    "1312": "A handful of comics tumbles to the ground as the ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again. After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel, sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall, causing more comics to be knocked free and fall onto the wheelchair and the nearby ground. They move down the aisle, and all is quiet until Elijah jerks the wheelchair to the left again, causing his metal brace and the wheelchair to crash into two racks, covering Elijah in comics. The Ponytail man moves to the front counter, while Elijah sits in a trance—slightly hunched over—and his eyes stare at a comic book in his lap. His expression changes for the first time as the Ponytail man finishes dialing and looks over to Elijah as he waits for a voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand. In a trendy restaurant, David and Audrey are on stools at one end of the bar, sipping their drinks as they appear in deep thought. Audrey leans slightly closer, and David's grin slowly fades; they're only a foot or so apart. David sips his drink slowly and glances at Audrey, who waits for his answer, her face tensing as she's on the verge of getting upset. Audrey's eyes glaze with water as David's eyes look up and make eye contact with hers, and he stares at her for the longest time. Husband and wife sit close together in the corner of the bar on their second date, and Audrey stands next to David as he pulls out his wallet. The babysitter with the black dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses stands ready to leave in the doorway as Audrey tries to hide her smile, which instantly fades. The babysitter fixes her Buddy Holly glasses as she looks at the two suddenly quiet faces, and David hands her the money. She opens the door, and it's started to rain, so she covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway, closing the door behind her. Audrey takes off her coat as she moves to the guest bedroom and disappears inside. Only the counter light is on in the kitchen where David stands by the phone. The driver of the truck slips and slides his way over to David, who looks at Audrey laying shivering in the grass before looking back at the driver. Elijah closes his eyes, and his face fills with strength. The interior of the station is a mystical sight, with one huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars rising into a misty hand-painted ceiling. David stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late-night trains.",
    "567": "The Perp flies past him, having leapt from twenty feet down to the top of the Guggenheim. On the roof, the Perp reaches the top, climbs over the edge, and crunches to the gravel surface. He runs to the front door of the Museum, shoots it open, and runs inside. He runs from the rotunda up the grand ramp of the Guggenheim. He leaps to his feet and races over to a door. It's locked. He tugs on another. It's locked too. He scrambles up and over the ledge. He pulls on a third. It swings open, revealing Edwards on the other side, breathing hard. He aims his weapon at the Perp. He decides and he falls, screaming, to his death. The silhouette of Edgar leaps to its feet, races to the door, and throws it open. Edgar is everything his voice led us to expect—a nasty, bug-eyed redneck carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun. His mouth agape, he walks across the yard and stares at the hulking shell that was his truck. The skeleton of the truck is still there, but there's a huge, smoldering hole in it, a hole that goes at least ten feet down into the ground. A woman sneaks into the room. Doctor Laurel Weaver, thirtyish, dark-haired, dark-eyed, general aura of darkness around her, stands above him. Laurel looks like she was just dragged out of bed (which she was) and saw a spaceman (which she did). She looks over her shoulder once, then whispers to him. Edwards twists in his chair, to get a better look. All he sees is Laurel, facing whoever it is in the hallway. The Someone says something else, and Laurel steps forward, now also out of Edwards's line of vision. Edwards stretches even further in his seat, when there is a blinding flash from the corridor. Really curious now, he starts to get up when Kay steps into the room and closes the door behind him. He crosses to the door. Edwards stops. At that point, the Inspector sticks his head in, smiles, and gives Edwards the thumbs up. Edwards looks at the Inspector, then at Kay. Kay opens the door and gets out of the car. They get out of the car. Edwards follows. Edwards looks around and sees they're standing in front of a pawn shop. He casually brushes some Rolexes off the counter. At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs suddenly pales, a look of fear coming over his face. He pulls his own gun and aims it at Jeebs' forehead. Edwards, seeing that Kay is getting somewhere, joins in the routine. KA-BOOM! Kay blows Jeebs' head off and Jeebs' body collapses to the floor.",
    "1209": "The soldier with the dancing girl drags her towards his hut, and she struggles. He slaps her, causing her to fall to the ground, then gestures to the hut and crawls underneath it. Unseen by the soldier, En-Joo clamps a hand over her mouth and holds a finger to his lips. The soldier looks underneath the hut for the girl, and En-Joo dives towards him, plunging a knife into his throat and stabbing repeatedly. He drags the soldier's body out of sight. Rambo runs out to a hut and dives underneath it, seeing Sarah lying prone in the pig sty. He throws open a wooden bolt, opens a gate, and crawls inside. He looks out through the timbers and sees the soldier with the bottle of spirits returning. Sarah is asleep or unconscious, and Rambo rushes over to the partition between them, pushing pigs out of the way. En-Joo checks his watch—10 seconds to 2. On the watch tower, School Boy has a soldier in the site of his weapon, and his watch shows 2 AM. He fires, starting by picking off the guard below and the guards in two adjacent watch towers. En-Joo and the girl exchange glances and move, but the boozy soldier has gotten to Sarah first. The hidden Rambo watches as she's dragged away, waits a few seconds, then follows them. BN's party joins En-Joo and the girls in a dark clearing beyond the camp gate. The soldier emerges from between two huts, dragging Sarah along by her hair, her arms tightly bound behind her back. Unseen, Rambo runs behind them. At the dance, one of the women is being held down and throttled by a soldier, and another trooper runs through the throng, brandishing a flare billowing red smoke. Lewis joins the other mercenaries, and Louis throws Michael to the ground and pulls a knife on him. BN leads them away, while School Boy shoots Lewis a murderous look. At the dance, the smoke from the flare is everywhere, and one of the women's dresses is torn away, leaving her topless. Rambo follows Sarah and the soldier, who drags her into his hut and throws her to the floor, with the door swinging closed behind them. At the dance, a struggling woman has her face slapped by one of the drunken crowd, and at the same time, Sarah suffers the same abuse at the hands of a soldier who bears down on her, reaching for his belt buckle. Rambo takes the officer from behind, grabbing a clump of the man's hair in his right hand and clutching the throat with his left, as the officer's face becomes a rictus grimace while Rambo's fingers dig deep into the cartilage and bone at the man's neck.",
    "723": "Lovejoy scowls as he follows Cal, who walks through the bridge, and they brush past an officer. Meanwhile, Ismay stands by the collapsible and glances at a crowd of passengers on the lower side of the bridge before turning back to the collapsible. While Murdoch turns away, Ismay slips into a seat on the collapsible, and Murdoch finds himself staring at his mate who gazes ahead. Murdoch glowers at his mate while motioning downward with both arms. The seamen lower the collapsible, and as it drops below the deck, Ismay glances up. Lightoller grabs a young girl and places her in a lifeboat. Rose turns to Jack, while Cal glances from Jack to Rose. Cal pulls off the blanket wrapped around Rose and shoves it at Jack before removing his own coat and placing it around Rose's shoulders. He starts to caress Rose's hair, but she backs away from him, and Jack steps up to her. A crewman grabs Rose and guides her toward the lifeboat, and Jack, along with another crew member, helps Rose climb into the boat. Rose turns and grasps Jack's outstretched hand as the crewman pushes Jack back and the lifeboat jerks. Standing at the rail, Cal and Jack gaze at Rose as the lifeboat lowers toward the water, and Rose stares back at Jack. Jack looks from Cal to the descending boat, while Rose looks around, up at the ropes running through the pulleys, and back at Jack. Rose sees a young girl next to her waving to her father while her sister cries, as a crew member on deck yells orders with arms raised out at his sides. Rose gazes back up at Jack, who stands beside Cal, as another flare shoots into the dark sky above them and briefly illuminates Rose's face. More streaking flares cascade in the sky above Jack, and suddenly Rose steps to the edge of the lifeboat, leaps from it, and hangs from the ship's rail several decks below Jack. Two crew members pull her on board, and she runs along the deck while Jack turns and runs along the main deck, past passengers and crew members. Rose runs along the lower deck, as Jack rushes inside and runs down the grand staircase. At the bottom of the stairs, Rose runs into his arms, and they embrace, kiss, and then hug. Cal gazes down at them from an upper landing. Stepping up to him, Lovejoy glances down, grabs Cal's shoulder, and pulls him away. As they step away from the railing, Cal grabs Lovejoy's gun from its holster and runs toward the stairs, pulling Rose away as Rose and Jack flee and Cal tears down the stairs after them.",
    "792": "Having smashed the clock and several empties, he sits down on the bed and drinks from a half-full bottle with a cigarette end floating in it. Meanwhile, a smart convertible pulls up at a car valeting service by the beach, and Willie strolls up as the driver hands over the keys. A young guy from the valet service drives off with the convertible, and Willie walks over to a board holding the car keys; he looks around then picks up several of the keys. He saunters through the parking lot pressing the remotes, causing cars to flash and unlock. Willie tosses away the keys nonchalantly and continues unlocking until he walks up to one of the cars he's just unlocked. He then presses another remote and turns to see a blue sports convertible, his eyes brighten, and he goes for that. Climbing in, he opens the glove compartment, takes out the tax disk, reads the address on it, replaces the disk, starts the engine, and drives away. The car is parked outside a grand mansion with a pillared entranceway. Inside, Willie climbs an elegant marble staircase toward a balustrated balcony, and upstairs, in a smart kitchen, he drinks milk from the bottle and replaces it in the well-stocked fridge. He munches on a chicken leg, sits on the toilet, fiddles with the handle of the un-flushing toilet, stands up, and looks at it. Tossing the chicken leg down the pan, he saunters aimlessly down the hallway and tips oil paintings off the wall. On a wood-paneled wall, he sees a large portrait of a boy with dark hair. He peeks behind the painting, removes it from the wall revealing a safe, and sticks his ear to the safe to start turning the combination lock. His eyes catch sight of a companion set by the fireplace; selecting the poker, he attacks the safe and finds lots of money. At an exotic club, he ignores the girl writhing in front of him and rubs a scratch card, looking up as she crawls away. The girl moves towards a second exotic dancer on stage in front of another punter, while Willie continues scratching away as a scantily clad waitress brings beer to him. He places a scratch card in her bikini bottoms. Later, she follows him into his apartment, wanders away as Willie winds back through his phone messages. Marcus and Willie are once again in their festive elf and Santa costumes, striding through a heat shimmer in a car park. Willie pulls his beer down with a cigarette dangling from the corner of his mouth, clutching a bottle of dog in his left hand as he strolls along, removes the cigarette from his mouth, and takes a good pull on his bottle, draining it of its contents.",
    "1343": "Along the streets, silent faces of the poor wait and watch as a column of black-suited dignitaries carrying branches of laurel passes by. Softly, in time with the drums, the watching people begin to sing, among them Enjolras, Marius, and the radical students. The dignitaries become aware of the singing and glance uneasily from side to side. Into frame comes a team of black horses stepping slowly, black plumes nodding, drawing behind them a gun carriage draped in the tricolour flag. As the coffin on its carriage draws level with the students, Enjolras suddenly steps out in front of the horses, waves the red flag, and stops the horses and the procession. The students break the ranks of the crowd and surround the coffin carriage. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and other students climb onto the top of the carriage, led by Combeferre. Police and national guardsmen control the growing crowds. The crowd supports them and surrounds the coffin carriage, blocking the police's attempts to intervene, singing with passion. Enjolras, the students, and the impassioned crowd have now become the procession. They turn off the main street away from the expected course of the funeral procession. As the procession turns off, the cavalry division gallops ahead and disappears around a corner. Gavroche's elephant looms over this side street. He slips away through the barricade, which is still rising. Grantaire prises the final piece of Madame Hucheloup's furniture from her arms - her favourite sewing armchair - and adds it to the barricade. The barricade is now complete: an impressive wall up to twelve feet high, with one heavily guarded section that can be wheeled open to allow access. Two smaller barricades protect the left and right side of the cafe. Enjolras climbs halfway up the main barricade and turns to his little army. Javert, still in his disguise as a rebel, is let back through the guarded 'gate' into the barricaded street. A single flaming torch atop the barricade, caged in by cobbles, underlights a fluttering red flag. They all look up; there's Gavroche, on the top of the barricade. Guns swing round to aim at Javert, who stares back in defiance. Enjolras faces Javert as bullets ricochet off the cornices of the houses, bore into the barricade, and wound several men. The red flag falls, the pole sliced through; everyone freezes. Marius brings the torch closer to the powder keg, but already the soldiers have cleared out. Marius comes down from the barricade, and as everyone surrounds him in amazement, he spots Eponine lying propped against the barricade. With a struggle, she pulls the letter out of her pocket and pushes it into his hand.",
    "555": "His face contorts in agony, and he grabs his stomach and turns toward Elsa as he starts to age rapidly, with his hair growing long, gray, and brittle. Elsa gasps and screams while his skin turns brown, leathery, and stretches across his bones until it splits. His skeletal hands reach for Elsa's throat, choking her, and Indy rushes forward to push Donovan away. As Donovan falls, his body breaks into flames and shatters against the wall. Indy studies the array of chalices and picks up another cup, a simple earthenware jug. He and Elsa exchange a look, and Indy goes to the well, fills the jug with water, and pauses before bringing it to his lips and taking several large swallows. Indy and Elsa come forward with the Grail, and the two Nazi soldiers are overawed by the possessors of the Grail. Indy kneels by Henry's side, tilts his head forward, and holds the Grail to his lips, but Henry is too weak to open his eyes. Henry swallows some of the water, though much of it runs down the corners of his mouth. Finally, Indy pours the water over the wound, and everyone watches in astonishment as the wound and bloodstain disappear. The color returns to Henry's face, his eyes open, and they first light up at the sight of the Grail and then even more at Indy’s face. Nazi soldiers run forward but drop their weapons and surrender. Elsa steps forward, picks up the Grail, and turns to Indy, her face alight with possession. She steps onto the edge of the Great Seal, a rumbling sound is heard, and the ground roars and shifts. Dirt falls from the ceiling of the cavern, Elsa falls on the Great Seal, and the Grail bounces away from her grasp. She reaches for it as the ground beneath her begins to split open, slipping into the crevasse. As her hands lose their grip, Indy manages to grab one, sliding forward across the slanted floor. While Elsa tries to get the Grail with her free hand, Indy can't save her unless she gives him her free hand, but her hand begins to slip from his grasp. As the ledge Indy lies on begins to break apart, Henry grabs his hand as Indy struggles to reach the Grail with the other. Indy abandons the Grail and grabs onto Henry with both hands, and Henry pulls him up to safety. They look through the falling debris at each other, and Sallah and Brody rush from the crumbling Temple.",
    "195": "Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George, and the goon is beside Potter's chair, as usual. George drops his cigar on his lap and nervously brushes off the sparks from his clothes. As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion because Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of physical contact, he knows he could never be associated with this man and drops his hand with a shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face, turns, and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside Potter's wheelchair. As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr. Potter's secretary in the outer office. The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap bed, a chair or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts relating to incidents in his past life. George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser, and stares at his reflection in the mirror. While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, his attention is caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser, which is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first saw in Mary's living room. Mary is now awake and starts singing their theme song. George crosses over and sits on the edge of the bed, and Mary nods her head happily. Over the following series of shots, we hear the voices of Joseph and Clarence in Heaven. George is crossing the street, heading for the offices of the Building and Loan. Mary is sitting on the floor playing with a baby, and a little boy is in a playpen nearby. Mary is busy hanging wallpaper and painting the old place. George has just come into the hall. He is obviously tired and discouraged as he starts up the stairs, and the knob on the banister comes off in his hand. A group of men, obviously just drafted, are marching along in a camp. Mrs. Bailey and other women in Red Cross uniforms are busily sewing, etc. Mary, with a portable U.S.O. pushcart, is serving coffee and doughnuts to men leaning from the train. Sam Wainwright is showing a set of blueprints to two Army officers. Potter is wheeled in toward a long table around which several men are seated. Gower and Uncle Billy are conducting a bond rally from the top of an Army tank. Bert, in uniform, is moving cautiously with a fixed bayonet, and there are smoke and flashes of gunfire in the background. Hundreds of planes are flying overhead with parachutes dropping from them. Marty is in the foreground, beckoning to soldiers to come on, and Harry is fastening the helmet of his flying clothes.",
    "982": "Benjamin stands with his hands in his pockets watching as she tries to turn but instead stumbles awkwardly, flexing her bad leg. She straightens her leg, turns, and holds onto a wall-mounted ballet bar as she puts her right leg up tightly behind her. Benjamin has his arm around her as they gaze at themselves in the mirror. Smiling, Daisy turns to look at him and stares gravely at his reflection. He takes his arm from around her shoulder and looks her in the eye. Daisy wears a searching expression, and Benjamin smiles. She throws her arms around him. They sit beside each other on a tram, Daisy smiles as Benjamin stares out of the window, and Benjamin seems distant. Returning from his thoughts, he looks at Daisy who smiles fondly, then his eyes turn to a man seated with his young daughter flexed and head down. Daisy puts an arm around Benjamin and kisses him softly on the cheek. At night, they sit opposite each other in a diner where she finishes an ice cream sundae then brushes a tiny piece of spilled ice cream from her swollen belly. He leans back in his seat, she takes his hand, and he offers an unconvincing smile before he beams, and she kisses his hand. Wearing an autumnal-colored poncho, Daisy heads off to the toilet as Benjamin puts money on the counter. There's a television in the corner. Daisy returns, and on screen, Elizabeth grins. They leave the diner, and he stops across the lounge, looking at her at the bottom of some stairs where she's bleeding. He rushes to the phone and darts down the basement stairs to Daisy who lies sprawled on the bloodstained floor beside a wash basket. Alone in the kitchen, Benjamin paces, peers out into the corridor, paces anxiously, and leans on a kitchen surface. A uniformed man and a female doctor exit the bedroom through separate doors, and Benjamin, doe-eyed, enters the bedroom to find Daisy lying with a newborn baby. He sits down on the bed, and they gaze at their daughter who's wrapped in a blanket. Benjamin watches as Daisy pops her little finger in the infant's mouth to stop her crying and looks back at Benjamin through teary eyes. He caresses his daughter. In the hospital, Caroline turns to her mother, and they share a look. Caroline puts down the diary and leaves Daisy's bedside, her brow furrowed and face gaunt, as Daisy watches Caroline wander out into the corridor. In Daisy's room, a clock beside the wall-mounted TV reads 5 to 10. Caroline lights up a cigarette, and the nurse, eating an apple, spots her. The TV weatherman is on, and Caroline stares at Daisy, who taps a fist on the bedside table. Caroline picks up the diary and reads aloud by the window.",
    "1139": "Harry dives into a fireplace and is whisked up, followed by Hermione and Ron with Yaxley close on their heels; Yaxley grabs them on their journey upwards, causing their faces to contort, but he loses his grip. Sunlight filters down through a leafy canopy, and still in Albert's clothes, Harry wakes lying on a carpet of dead leaves in a forest. Glancing to his right, he sees the locket, and after slipping off Albert's coat, he scrambles over to the locket and picks it up. Hermione is on her knees by a shivering Ron, while Harry searches desperately in the bag, points his wand, and a bottle pops into his hand. She treats the gaping wound on Ron's left shoulder with a few drops of the essence, sealing the wound as her bloodied hands reveal her relief. Hermione gets to her feet and walks away, and Harry takes her place at Ron's side. Hermione braces herself and lifts her wand as Harry looks at her bag. A dim light glimmers inside a small tent when Harry aims his wand at the locket and smoke rises from it. All three walk towards it, Ron with his left arm in a sling, while the locket lies unscathed amongst the dead leaves. Hermione tries, the locket is engulfed in flames, but it remains unmarked and is thrown across the clearing. Looking weary and ill, Ron gazes down at it as it flies even further away. Harry stares angrily at the shining metal as the flames die out, but the locket remains firmly closed. Harry picks it up, slips the chain over his head, and tucks the locket inside his shirt while Hermione looks anxiously at him. Harry stares at them both, then turns abruptly and walks away, later sitting outside the tent, studying his piece of broken mirror; he spins around, hearing a radio being tuned in the tent, and catches sight of Hermione down in a hollow. He lifts the locket from under his shirt and holds it in his hand, which twists as he connects with Voldemort, witnessing a boy thief escaping with a wand after Voldemort kills Gregorovitch. Harry gasps for breath, and Hermione walks slowly up to him, looking concerned as he glares at the tent. Hermione glances away, and Harry looks impatient, stomping off and reaching inside his shirt. He struggles to hold a chain over his head and hands her the locket and chain, which she studies before walking slowly away from Harry, whose head is lowered. Hermione sits on guard by a campfire in front of the tent, stands up at a sound, while in the tent, Harry wakes up with his head resting on a table, glancing over at the sleeping Ron.",
    "959": "Louis sits up in the driver's seat with his face bloodied, and he looks in his rearview mirror. Alice turns around and sees the creature. Louis tries to get out of the car and tumbles out of the passenger door, then he runs back up the street and trips over Alice's bike. Soldiers watch a colleague using a flamethrower. Charles and Joe pick up their processed film, and as they cycle off past the town's water tower, a vast plume of smoke rises just outside the town. Stuck in an indentation on the side of the water tower tank is the vibrating cube. Their footage from the night of the crash shows just clouds of smoke, but when the smoke clears, they see footage of a giant spider-like creature creeping out of a carriage. Hearing the siren, they look around in confusion, and Joe stops the projector, breaking the film off. Outside, chaos reigns on the streets as people and military personnel hurry to and fro. Joe and Charles walk down the street and see a huge pool of smoke rising above the town, while panicked families load their cars in preparation to evacuate. Troops direct traffic and issue instructions, and Charles and Joe prepare to board a bus as a convoy leaves town led by several military vehicles. They pass military container lorries carrying the white cubes recovered from the crash site on their way into town as the evacuation convoy heads out. Charles and Joe are aboard one of the buses, and the convoy eventually arrives at Greenville Air Force Base, where vehicles queue to get in through the east entrance. Inside, civilians disembark from the buses in a huge hangar, and Air Force personnel shepherd them along. Joe wanders through the hangar looking for Jack and sees Louis lying on a bed in a sickbay area. He goes over to Louis, who looks relieved, and then finds Charles, Preston, Martin, and Carrie. Meanwhile, Donnie, the camera shop guy, looks around as an armed guard opens the door and escorts him along a corridor. Jack punches the guard out, takes his gun, and, now dressed in the guard's uniform and clutching his rifle, trots along a corridor, making his way through a couple of offices. He looks outside, spots a fuel tanker nearby, and shoots it, causing an explosion that distracts the Air Force personnel. Jack then helps himself to a Jeep and drives off along an unmetaled track running through open fields. He pulls up near a grain silo, gets out of the Jeep, and sees a convoy of vehicles traveling along an adjacent road.",
    "254": "Two pedestrians help the shaken Butch out of the wreckage as the woozy Marsellus gets to his feet. Marsellus follows the gawker's finger and sees Butch Coolidge down the street, looking a shambles. The big man takes out a .45 Automatic and the gawkers back away. Marsellus starts moving toward Butch, and Butch sees the fierce figure making a wobbly beeline toward him. Butch quickly takes measure of the situation, then stands next to the door. Before Maynard can finish his threat, Marsellus charges in. The gangster's feet go out from under him, and the big man falls flat on his back. Butch pounces on the fallen body, punching him twice more in the face. Butch takes the gun out of Marsellus’ hand, then grabs ahold of his middle finger. Butch and Marsellus look up at Maynard, who's brandishing a pump-action shotgun, aimed at the two men. Marsellus passes out, and they are tied up in two separate chairs. In their mouths are two S&M-style ball gags, with a belt going around their heads and a little red ball sticking in their mouths. Both men are unconscious. Maynard steps in with a fire extinguisher and sprays both guys until they're wide awake and wet as otters. The two prisoners look up at their captors. Maynard stands in front of them, fire extinguisher in one hand, shotgun in the other, and Marsellus’ .45 sticking in his belt. Without saying another word, Maynard climbs up the stairs. Butch and Marsellus look around the room. After taking in their predicament, Butch and Marsellus look at each other, all traces of hostility gone, replaced by a terror they both share at what they've gotten themselves into. Maynard and Zed come through the curtains; the two hillbillies are brothers. Zed walks in and stands in front of the two captives. He inspects them for a long time, then says, Butch makes no reply. Maynard opens a trap door in the floor, reaches into the hole, and comes back holding onto a leash. He gives it a rough yank, and from below the floor rises the Gimp, a man they keep dressed from head to toe in black leather bondage gear. There are zippers, buckles, and studs here and there on the body. On his head is a black leather mask with two eye holes and a closed zipper for a mouth. Zed takes the chair, sits it in front of the two prisoners, then lowers into it. Maynard hands the Gimp's leash to Zed, then backs away. The Gimp gets on its knees. Maynard hangs back while Zed appraises the two men. Butch and Marsellus are terrified as Maynard looks back and forth at the victims, while the Gimp's eyes go from one to the other inside the mask.",
    "753": "Directly ahead, the enormous, bright disk of the station clock looms as people scurry across the concourse in the beams of cold silver light from lamps high above in the ceiling. Uniformly grey against the grey floor and walls, David descends the stone staircase and stands at the foot of the stairs in a baseball cap and rain cape, watching humanity ebb and flow. He starts to walk unhurriedly through the crowd when a young blonde woman in a bright red jacket bumps into him. He then sees, watching from above, the same woman in a different shiny jacket in a jewelry shop. She points at an elderly assistant, and as his back is turned, she reaches over the counter, takes a bracelet, and drops it into her bag. David watches her disappear into the crowd and then moves slowly on, with other people passing and some touching him. He stops in the middle of the concourse, people swirling around him, and holds his left hand out slightly, fingers extended, as a man in a check shirt worn outside his trousers brushes into David's extended hand. Once again, he's looking down from high above, watching the man in the check shirt lean out of a pickup and smash a bottle over the head of a black woman strolling along a city street at night. Frowning, David sees the man drain a beer can and drop it into a trash bin. A young man in a green shirt kneels by a bed where a young woman in a very short party dress is sprawled. She rolls over, unhearing, the dress revealing her thighs. The boy watches for a moment, rises, and the girl's leg slips off the bed as she lies on her side, blonde hair spread over an assortment of coats, unmoving. The boy leaves, closing the door behind him. David turns and looks around the station as a group of college students, all wearing maroon baseball caps, files past him. He looks beyond them and sees the young man in a green jacket embrace his mother and turn to smile at his father. David watches, starts to walk backwards, swallowing hard, and glancing at other people as they pass by, backing into a maintenance man in orange overalls pushing a trash bin on wheels. A man opens his front door to the maintenance man now in an orange T-shirt, and the two men stare at each other through the outer fly screen door. The maintenance man grabs the door and holds it open while David sees an image of the house owner sprawled on the basement steps. He stares upwards for a moment, his eyes wide, and still looking shocked, he gazes around the concourse and spots the maintenance man emptying the trash can on the far side.",
    "850": "He stands, grasps her shoulder for a moment, and walks away, while Charlie's brow is anxiously wrinkled. Mist wafts over the hands of the hordes of possessed standing outside as they slowly rock from side to side, beneath a full moon that glows between dark clouds. Something hangs overhead, looking down at the diner as Bob and Jeep walk in. Charlie stands staring at Michael, who slowly steps towards her, while Sandra grabs the baby and Michael aims the gun. Something flies down towards the diner as, standing beside Charlie, Audrey shakes her head. Outside, light washes over the possessed, and intense white light shines through the entrance as the door blasts open. Michael shoots Sandra in the head, causing her to jerk backward and drop the baby, which Jeep dives and catches. Gabriel steps out of the bright light, a tall, muscular man with enormous black wings, and spreads his wings, swinging a mace down to the baby. Holding him, Jeep rolls out of the way as the mace slashes a hole in the floor. Bob shoots at Gabriel while Jeep gives the baby to Charlie, and Gabriel spins, deflecting the bullets with his wings wrapped around him. Gabriel slices across Bob's chest, and Bob drops his gun, feeling his bloody chest, before Gabriel swipes him across the face, throwing him onto a cooker. Michael gives Jeep some keys, and Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey rush to a door and open it, finding the possessed standing with their heads bowed, a walkway between them. Jeep steps out holding a pistol, followed by Charlie holding the baby, and Audrey, as Jeep leads the way with his gun held out in front. The possessed stand motionless with mist floating above their bowed heads, while in the diner, Gabriel stands facing Michael, who shakes his head slightly. The possessed step aside as Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey walk between them and reach a figure with a bag over its head, standing in front of the police car. In the diner, Gabriel studies Michael while the figure with the bag over its head wheezes and whacks the hood of the police car with a stick. Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey get in the police car as Michael walks up to Gabriel, and Jeep drives them away while Michael steps right up to Gabriel, who studies him. Jeep keeps his eye on the wing mirror as he drives away. Michael clasps his hand against Gabriel's cheek, looks him in the face, and Gabriel's eyes moisten as he looks down, his lips moving as if grasping for words. Gabriel clutches Michael's hand and looks deep into his eyes before pushing him away. Michael readies his assault rifle as blades poke out of Gabriel's mace, and Gabriel spreads his wings and his chest, lunging towards Michael, who shoots and leaps out of the way.",
    "153": "He is young and vigorous and swivels on the ground as though to strike back, but Nehru lunges toward him and a lathi is brought smashing across the side of Nehru's head. He feels the side of his head, the blood soaking his hand, and struggles to his feet, facing the policeman who has struck him. The Viceroy ponders it favorably, while the senior police officer is brought up by the chill directness of it. He looks at Irwin and the principal secretary for a moment in uncertainty. As he turns to leave, Irwin speaks almost offhandedly, and the senior police officer stares at him. Barbed wire stretches on either side of the stockade-like entrance, and above the gate we see the sign DHARASANA SALT WORKS. Before it, six British police officers and two Indian police officers command a large troop of Indian policemen. They face their opposition, unmoving, tense. The camera pans from them, across a sloping dip in the ground, to a huge group of volunteers lining up to face the police as tautly as the police face them. Walker is off to one side, climbing to stand in the back of Collin's car, watching, looking tensely from one group to the other, almost terrified by what seems about to happen. Collins leans against the back of the car near him, watching with an equally appalled expectancy, and there are two other reporters near them. From Walker's point of view, we see Mirabehn and some Indian women quietly placing stretchers and tables of bandages near a group of tents where the volunteers have been housed. Walker turns back to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance, and the air itself seems breathless with tension. He has approached the chief police officer and stops before him politely. He turns and starts down the dip toward the gate and the waiting lathis of the police. A series of shots shows Azad leading the first row of volunteers down and up the dip as we intercut Walker, frozen, watching the inevitable onslaught, with the British police commanding officer ready to give the first order. He speaks it, trying only half successfully to keep the emotion from his voice. Irwin is in shadows behind his desk, looking still in some kind of shock, staring at Gandhi, and faces Gandhi stiffly. The whirr of a camera, and a swift cut to a wide screen, but slightly under-cranked with the bad cutting and predictable music of the old newsreels. Gandhi, Mirabehn, and Gandhi's secretary, Desai, are waving goodbye from the boat deck of their ship as it sails, with Mirabehn holding the tether of a goat, all of them smiling at the camera like voyagers everywhere.",
    "72": "DANTE holds a ball in the center of the court while REDDING stretches, leaning against the sign. DANTE skids to the sidelines and then skates to his side before skidding back to the sidelines to address the CUSTOMER. Below, a WOMAN pulls at the door, peers into the store with her face against the glass, backs up, and shields her eyes while looking toward the roof. A new face-off pits DANTE against the CUSTOMER, who winds up and takes a hard shot. The ball sails off the court, through the air, and into a faraway yard, dropping between the two as DANTE gets flattened. DANTE scrambles to the edge and calls over, looks around hyperventilating, and calls to the sidelines as SANFORD skates up to him. DANTE skates off and is later seen standing on a ladder, replacing a fluorescent light while an OLD MAN joins him at the foot of the ladder. With the light in place, DANTE descends the ladder and closes it, glances over and reacts as the OLD MAN walks off, and he heads back to the counter. The OLD MAN returns, visibly taking DANTE aback. DANTE is then seen driving with passenger RANDAL, their backs to the camera, in absolute silence, before DANTE glares at RANDAL. A MASSIVE CROWD is outside the store as DANTE and RANDAL walk up the path to the funeral parlor. Car locks are slammed down as DANTE and RANDAL run from the front door, chased by a small crowd of angry mourners, and the car screams away. The pursuing crowd stands in the middle of the street, shaking their fists and throwing things as the car pulls up, and RANDAL and DANTE get out where absolutely nobody is outside. JAY enters the frame next to RANDAL, aims his butt at him, and farts, prompting DANTE to grab RANDAL, and RANDAL to lunge for him. A KID tugs at JAY'S shirt before they head back to the counter, and DANTE walks away, shaking his head. DANTE puts up cigarettes as the CUSTOMER lets it sink in and leaves in a huff, while another CUSTOMER leans in, and RANDAL spits a mist of water at him, drenching him. The man reacts violently, attempting to grab RANDAL from over the counter as DANTE plays block, but RANDAL makes no move and remains untouched, saluting the CUSTOMER as he leaves, wiping water from his face. RANDAL exits as DANTE waits on a customer (TRAINER), lifting a gallon of milk into a paper bag with a slight grunt, and a female customer (HEATHER) leans in the doorway. A SUITED MAN carrying a notebook comes to the counter, scribbles in his notebook, rips out a piece of paper, and hands it to DANTE before exiting with DANTE trying to follow.",
    "789": "Marcus and Willie are in the back room, where a ladder leads up to the air vent. Willie snaps a popper, causing Marcus to glare at him. While the guard bids farewell to shoppers, Marcus crawls through the vent. Once Willie and the last of the shoppers have gone, the security guard checks his watch and taps a code into the alarm system. Marcus is in the air conditioning duct overlooking the security booth and presses a button on a remote control, switching off all the security cameras, then hurries back along the duct. He plunges down the duct, heading straight down, and smashes through a vent above a table of sweaters Lois had repositioned to break his fall. The table collapses, and he leaps to his feet, running to the alarm console and turning it off with two seconds to spare. A service elevator opens, and Marcus and Willie step out, Willie towing a trolley of safe-cracking equipment. They break into an office, and Marcus walks over to a large safe, with Willie staring at it aghast. Still staring at the safe, Willie sits down, and later he tries to crack the combination, while Marcus wheels a handcart through the mall. At home, Thurmond carefully lays the table for dinner and selects a bottle of wine. Marcus is on his annual shopping spree, helping himself to all the various goodies Lois had listed. Having failed with the combination, Willie falls back on drilling to crack the safe, grimacing as he withdraws the bit from the door. Next, he dons dark goggles and tries to cut his way in with an arc welder, but the welding doesn't go well. At home, Sue takes a sauce bottle from the fridge and hands it to Thurmond. Meanwhile, Marcus takes a red camisole off a shop dummy and kisses its left breast, then comes to the dummy modeling the mink stole, which is too tall for him to reach. After jumping up and down a bit, he catches his breath and spots another mannequin holding a golf club. He takes the club and tries to remove the stole from around the dummy's neck with it, but it won't budge. Eventually, he gives up and uses the club like an ax to chop the dummy's legs off. Down in the office, Willie has resorted to brute force and uses a sledgehammer on the safe door. Willie doesn’t crack the safe, but Marcus succeeds in felling the dummy and takes the stole from around its neck. Willie listens to the back of the safe and taps it as Marcus comes into the office just as Willie emerges from around the back of the safe.",
    "344": "GOLLUM is cowering back, coughing and spluttering. FRODO looks at SMEAGOL in shock and gets to his feet, while SMEAGOL stares at FRODO in disbelief. In a fury, SMEAGOL lunges at FRODO, who falls backwards, dangerously close to the edge of the precipice, as GOLLUM tumbles over FRODO's body and falls to the bottom of the ravine. FRODO, overcome with exhaustion, stumbles down the steep stairs of CIRITH UNGOL, full of remorse at his treatment of SAM, and falls to his knees. FRODO lands on soft green grass and sees sun-drenched images of trees. In a hazy image, GALADRIEL walks towards him, barefoot, and leans down, offering her hand. For a beat, FRODO stares at her, torn, not wanting to go on and wanting to lie down, but he knows what he must do. FRODO is lifted to his feet, once again in the dark, rank tunnels of the pass of CIRITH UNGOL, and he goes on. Flaming missiles rain down on the city as GROND thuds against the MINAS TIRITH gate, sending a vibration through the city. GANDALF, on SHADOWFAX, leads several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers down through the streets. PIPPIN watches as FARAMIR's unconscious body is carried on a stretcher by DENETHOR's servants, led by DENETHOR. It has the atmosphere of a funeral as an iron door creaks open and FARAMIR's procession enters a wide vaulted chamber where lantern light throws great shadows upon the shrouded walls. Row upon row of marble tombs are visible in the dim light, with each tomb having a sleeping form carved in stone, hands folded. DENETHOR turns to his servants. The gate splinters with a boom under GROND's mighty weight. Behind the gates, the Gondorian foot soldiers are fearful. GANDALF rallies the line of bowmen as they wait in front of the great doors, their courage wavering with each crashing. Suddenly, the fearsome head protrudes into MINAS TIRITH. Within moments, the gate is smashed, and giant cave trolls enter into the first circle of MINAS TIRITH under the archway that no enemy had ever passed. Rows of archers fire off a volley of arrows, but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs. Orcs swarm through the opening, and the pitched, hand-to-hand battle spills into flames and blackened, smouldering buildings. With a roar, GANDALF leads a counterattack on SHADOWFAX, followed by several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers, as thousands of orcs swarm in through the city gates, and the first level is breached. FRODO staggers through the pass of CIRITH UNGOL, the weight of the ring dragging at his neck. He moves forward, fueled by a grim resolve, and starts climbing a stone staircase that climbs through a narrow pass.",
    "309": "Tommy and Kayleigh load popcorn and drinks onto Evan's lap as Lenny pushes the wheelchair. Evan celebrates his 14th birthday and blows out the candles. Evan screams as blood pours from his nose, and Lenny is out of bed at once to help him, as is Kayleigh. Evan sips from a beer cap as Lenny and Kayleigh make out in plain sight with Tommy's bashful approval. Evan is in agony as Kayleigh opens a series of dorm doors and Lenny rushes Evan's wheelchair through. Kayleigh carries a pair of prosthetic arms in her hands. Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair. Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background. Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd, which then breaks up and leaves. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms and looks up as they roll along, his eyes brightening when he sees Evan. Kayleigh looks at Evan, and he allows her to roll him away from the others. Kayleigh, now by a bench, stops and sits. As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him. His prosthetic hand crushes it, and it crumbles to dust. Kayleigh shakes her head sadly, then suddenly looks up. Evan turns to see Lenny waving her over. She puts her hand on Evan's shoulder, stands, and goes to Lenny. Evan can't take his eyes off her. He observes Lenny kissing Kayleigh and turns away, utterly heartbroken. Evan's stump turns on a bathtub faucet, and fully clothed, he lies in a bathtub that's filling with water. Beside the tub, the wheelchair has been tipped over. The water rises past his mouth to his nostrils, and Evan makes his peace and takes a final breath. The water spills over the side of the tub, and all Evan can do is watch it, still breathing easily through his nose. Tommy enters, pushes a lever, and the mechanical wheelchair rolls itself out of the room. Evan watches Lenny eagerly as he dumps tons of Evan's junk on the floor: old report cards, books, toys, and photo albums. Evan beams when he sees Lenny holding his old journal. Lenny, utterly baffled, sits back in silence and watches Evan begin reading his journal to himself for a beat. Evan comes to in his childhood kitchen, springs to his feet, and flexes his real hands triumphantly. He rummages through the utensil drawer, pulls out a large butcher knife, and tries to tuck it into his sock, but it won't fit.",
    "83": "The sequence begins with them unwillingly getting moving as both women set off, with WILLA going to the River and ICEY heading towards the GROUP. We track after ICEY as the PREACHER approaches, and ICEY, crossing him, gives him a little shove towards WILLA and acts coy. We follow her to the women who are busying themselves with the fudge. Meanwhile, JOHN and PEARL approach, with JOHN looking hard towards WILLA and the PREACHER from his viewpoint in a tableau of decorous courtship, framed by heavy domestic bodies. They sit by the water among drooling willows, almost in travesty of a romantic scene. His head goes slantwise and he smiles oddly, watching intently towards his mother; PEARL holds his hand. In the background, WALT looks sheepish. All look towards WILLA, who is standing and beckoning JOHN. They start towards their mother as the others agree with her. As JOHN and PEARL, with the DOLL, come shyly up, WILLA is radiant. He desperately conceals his reaction, thinking BEN has betrayed him, and now conceals his new reaction. WILLA touches PREACHER's hand warmly as she walks away towards ICEY and the WOMEN. JOHN moves to stand in front of the PREACHER; PEARL stands beside him with the DOLL. From JOHN's eye-level, as JOHN steps in front of him and PEARL beside him, the hands named LOVE and HATE straighten the necktie. JOHN looks down and then up to see PREACHER in close-up, hands busy o.s., PEARL with the doll, and between them, in the background, WILLA. She is now running fast towards ICEY, who walks towards her with arms outstretched, behind them being the group of WOMEN. Birdie sits beside his open door, strumming a guitar and singing. The scene is lamplighted from within as Ben’s skiff is inverted on trestles in the foreground. At the start of the scene, we only see JOHN's feet as he's under the skiff, examining it. After three lines of song, he comes out from under, lounges against the skiff, tracing a tarry seam with his forefinger, while Birdie lazily picks at his guitar for the rest of the scene. JOHN then leaves the shot, and as he runs past SPOON's, looking in, he is curious. ICEY embraces WILLA, or waltzes her around, as WALT looks on, pleased, while JOHN hurries away from us towards home. In the otherwise dark house, one window is lighted. JOHN enters the shot, his back to us, and hesitates, seeing the lighted window. After a silent pause, listening, he walks cautiously towards us in a tall, narrow shooting-frame, with right and left thirds of the screen in black. We shoot from inside the screen door as JOHN crosses the porch, softly opens the door, enters on tiptoe, and pauses, close to us, in the dark hallway, listening sharply. Relieved, but puzzled, he tiptoes along towards the rear of the hallway in close-up as we pull away.",
    "329": "Gandalf looks at him more keenly as Bilbo leads Gandalf into Bag End, which is cozy and cluttered with souvenirs of Bilbo's travels. Gandalf has to stoop to avoid hitting his head on the low ceiling. Bilbo hangs up Gandalf's hat on a peg and trots off down the hall, disappearing into the kitchen as Gandalf looks around, enjoying the familiarity of Bag End. He turns, knocking his head on the light and then walking into the wooden beam, groaning. Gandalf stops in front of a framed map, charred in one corner; it is Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain, and Gandalf smiles to himself. Gandalf watches amused as Bilbo tries to hide, and Bilbo's fingers close around his waistcoat pocket, gripping a small, unseen object. Gandalf and Bilbo are sitting on the Bag End porch, and below them, final preparations are being made on the Party field. Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring and watches it rise into the air, as a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails glides through the center of Bilbo's smoke ring. Glowing flowers rain down from branches, evaporating just above the upturned faces of the delighted party-goers, with 144 Hobbits feasting and drinking. Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and the tables are piled high with steaming scones and savories. Bilbo is greeting visitors while Frodo and Sam sit at a table drinking ale. Frodo notices Sam's eyes keep flicking to another pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away. Sam goes to drain his glass, but suddenly it is snatched out of his hands as Frodo thrusts him into the middle of a passing throng of dancers as he is swept away. Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer, while Gandalf sets alight a particularly spectacular firework that draws gasps of admiration from the party guests. Bilbo relates stories of his adventure to a group of young hobbit children, and with their upturned faces, their eyes grow larger and larger. Stunned gasps from his young audience greet his astonishing feat! Merry and Pippin, two mischievous young Hobbits in their late teens, are present, and Pippin scrambles onto the back of Gandalf's wagon, snatching up a small firework. Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark that dances magically from his staff. Large hands suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears, as Gandalf looks down sternly. They are later seen leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water with Gandalf sitting nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. Bilbo steps on a stool, bowing in gratitude at the applause, with Frodo and Gandalf smiling to themselves. Bilbo's hand pulls something out of his waistcoat pocket and holds it behind his back as a strange hum seems to fill his head. Bilbo gives Gandalf a look and nods toward the mantelpiece.",
    "262": "Hi moves toward Evelle, his teeth set, meaning business, but Gale steps in front of Hi, snapping the chamber shut and leaving the frame while still talking. Gale returns into frame holding another handgun, in addition to the .38, this one an automatic, and snaps a clip into the automatic. Hi is leaving the frame again, continuing to talk as we hear him rummaging offscreen, then he enters the frame with two handguns stuck in his belt and holding his pump-action shotgun, priming it with a WHOOSH-CLACK. From the front bumper of an automobile, beautiful desert stretches to the horizon as the road rushes under the camera. Gale drives, gazing out at the road while Evelle holds Nathan Jr., occasionally bouncing him contemplatively. Evelle is looking down at the baby, shifting him in his lap as Gale looks over and Evelle, beaming, looks up from the baby to Gale. A carton of diapers is set down on the check-out counter, where Evelle and the Cashier, a late-middle-aged man, perhaps the proprietor of the small mom-and-pop store, face each other. Evelle has various baby purchases, including diapers and baby food, piled on the counter that the Cashier is ringing up. Through the open door beyond them, a strip of the parking lot is visible. Up over his head, Evelle takes a plastic-covered squirt gun off a display rack and drops it on the counter while looking around at other impulse purchases displayed by the register; he unhooks a bag of balloons and is pulling a gun out of his belt as the Cashier is already down on the floor, out of frame. With his hands free now, Gale reaches for the back door while Evelle sorts through his purchases. Gale is looking around, puzzled, and the two men look at each other before their heads whip around to look in the back seat, then they look at each other in horror as their eyes widen, remembering at the same time, and both look up at the roof of the car. Coming off the accelerator and screaming as he watches the foot, Gale, choked up, speaks in a low unsteady voice. Ed is driving, and both are staring wordlessly ahead at the road as Hi looks over at Ed, glum but trying to be kind, nodding to himself, which shuts Hi up. After a moment, Hi clears his throat. A huge rumbling rippling red ball fills the frame as we hear footfalls on concrete steps, and Smalls rises into frame, apparently climbing a stoop, with the sun behind him throwing him into silhouette and the extreme telephoto flattening him against the sun. Heat waves ripple between the viewer and him, making his figure slightly waver.",
    "493": "He points to the chair on the other side of the coffee table. He closes his eyes tight. Cole, surprised, takes a small step forward. Cole takes a step. Malcolm opens his eyes. He looks right at Cole. Cole takes another step. The next step will put him at the chair. Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple. Malcolm smiles. Malcolm looks to Cole's arm. Cole is wearing a large silver watch. It swims on his thin wrist. Malcolm closes his eyes. Cole takes a step back. Malcolm lowers his hands surprised. Malcolm puts his fingers to his temple. He gazes at Cole's school uniform. Cole takes a slow step back. Cole answers by taking a small step back. Malcolm looks down at Cole's feet. Cole is very still. Malcolm takes his time before speaking. He just stares. Cole quietly takes a step back into the doorway of the other room. Cole's tiny figure steps away. Malcolm hurriedly enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian restaurant. He finds Anna. Anna sits alone at a corner table. A small piece of cake with a candle in it sits untouched. Anna stirs sugar in her coffee as Malcolm sits in the seat across from her. Anna quietly takes a sip from her coffee. She glances across the table, then looks down. Malcolm demonstrates by holding up his arm to shield his face. Malcolm stops walking. The words hit him hard. He stares at Cole. Cole is surprised. Cole is playing behind the couch. All we see is the top of his head. Every now and then we get glimpses of things Cole is playing with peeking over the back of the couch, but we can't quite make out what he's doing. The top of Cole's head stops moving. Cole has become very still. He looks right at Malcolm. Malcolm watches him carefully. He rises and grabs his coat. Cole's brow furrows as he thinks about it carefully. Malcolm turns back to Cole. Cole's sad eyes stare up at Malcolm. The surface of Malcolm's desk is covered with open texts. Malcolm pours over a thick reference book. He circles a phrase. His face turns up to the ceiling. Malcolm gets up and moves closer to their voices as he stretches his legs. Malcolm smiles at Anna. Malcolm slowly stops smiling. Malcolm shakes his head in disbelief. Mr. Cunningham turns and stares at his class of eight and nine year old private school students. Cole rests his chin on his desk and watches the class with big eyes. Stanley Cunningham looks over the class of blank faces. He's just about to answer his own question when he sees a hand go up. Mr. Cunningham looks surprised to see who it is.",
    "1160": "Lupin grabs Harry tightly and holds him back. Struggling to free himself, Harry's grief turns to rage when he sees Bellatrix Lestrange's evil smile, and she slips away quickly around a dark corner. Harry breaks free from Lupin and races after her, catching up with her as she runs through the great hall of the Ministry of Magic. The spell stops her, and she falls; Bellatrix cowers on the ground as Harry stands over her aiming his wand. His neck twists and flexes, and he hesitates, gripping his wand. Suddenly, Voldemort appears, and Harry turns as Voldemort knocks Harry's wand from his hand. There is a flash of green smoke as Dumbledore appears out of a fireplace and pushes Harry aside, with Bellatrix disappearing in a flash of green smoke. Voldemort flicks his wand, and Dumbledore retaliates with red light streaming from Dumbledore's wand while green light comes from Voldemort's. The two powerful forces meet like molten lava in a burst of flashing sparks and flame, as Harry cowers. Voldemort breathes out a gigantic serpent, weaved in red hot flames, which bears its fangs and heads for Harry. Dumbledore holds it back, and hovered against the wall, Harry shields his face from the heat while Dumbledore draws a great wave of water from the pools surrounding the fountain to submerge Voldemort, forming a huge rolling ball with Voldemort trapped inside. Voldemort bursts out, and Dumbledore launches a blast of powerful energy; Voldemort staggers and then returns it, hurling Dumbledore backwards. Windows shatter, and the banner with the picture of Fudge is torn to shreds by flying shards of glass as Voldemort's face twists into a snarl. He sends the jagged pieces of broken glass hurling towards Harry and Dumbledore, who produces a force field to protect them, deflecting and reducing the pieces to a fine sand. Voldemort's grin of triumph fades as Dumbledore faces him, standing in front of Harry to protect him, before Voldemort suddenly disappears in a whirlwind of sand, which ruffles Dumbledore's white beard. A shiver runs through the sand on the floor at their feet and heads towards Harry, whose body stiffens and convulses before he falls to the ground. His eyes are dark-rimmed, red, and staring as he glares at Dumbledore and speaks. Harry writhes in agony as painful images fill his mind: his mother, Cedric lying dead, and Sirius fading away from him, while Dumbledore kneels beside Harry. Harry sees himself as Voldemort, and Dumbledore leans over him anxiously as Harry lies still. Hermione, Ron, and the others come into the wrecked hall of the Ministry of Magic and stop in alarm when they see Dumbledore kneeling beside Harry. Seeing his friends, Harry recalls happy memories of his parents and good times at Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron, while Voldemort sneers.",
    "285": "She is wearing a Kelly Green suit and is seated at her dressing table. Jeff looks down and smiles to himself. He turns and raises the long-focus camera to his eye. The long-focus lens brings Miss Lonely Hearts into an enlarged picture that reveals details we have not previously noticed. A pair of ill-fitting horn-rimmed reading glasses rest halfway down her nose, and she has to tilt her head back slightly as she applies lipstick with their aid. Satisfied, she takes off the glasses and examines her face as a whole through squinting eyes. Her hair-do makes her seem middle-aged. She has faded good looks, fairly nice clothes, but is badly in need of advice on hair dressing. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor next to her and takes a long drink. Putting the glass down, she squints to see if she has disturbed the lipstick. Unable to see clearly, she puts on the glasses again, looks, and touches up her lips slightly. She puts her glasses in a handbag, then stands to put out the lights. She walks into the living room, finishing the drink. The long-focus lens moves with her. She goes straight for a bottle of liquor, pours out a final neat slug, and tosses it off. Then she leaves the apartment with a show of determination. She turns out the lights behind her. Jeff lowers the long-focus lens and turns his head to the right as he hears the first notes of the songwriter's melody, which we have heard him trying to complete. He is in black tie, and from the looks of the apartment, he is preparing for guests. An attractive girl is setting out trays of canapés, glasses, ice, and liquor. She pauses as she crosses the room carrying a tray of food. She listens a moment to the songwriter's melody. She comments on it to the songwriter, who starts from the beginning again, playing it more fully. Her expression shows that it pleases her and moves her romantically. Jeff's head turns in this new direction. Miss Torso and a male partner whom we have not seen before are practicing a pas de deux. A new source of music comes in to interfere with the piano playing. It is orchestral ballet music in a modern style. He is a tall, flowing-haired young man, lithe and graceful beyond normal masculine capacity. They stop at one point to listen to a word of comment from a woman who is watching. By her gestures, she is obviously a professional choreographer. The camera pans from this to the street beyond. Standing there on the sidewalk, looking up and down the street, is a Kelly Green clad figure.",
    "1330": "A dark, bloody shoe steps out from the ice cream truck, and the camera moves up the long grey pant leg spotted with blood stains to reveal a skeletally thin man in tattered coveralls. As he steps into the beams of the headlights, he becomes more clearly visible; he's tall. He surveys the diner, the garage, and the roof, assessing the situation. On the roof, the men wait for something to happen. That's when the ice cream man's jaw unhinges and stretches, causing everyone except Michael to practically hyperventilate with fear. The ice cream man bolts for the diner with startling speed, his movements resembling those of a human insect. Michael aims and bullets rip into the creature's body, knocking him flat on his back, with arms and legs in a twisted, twitching mess. Michael keeps his aim. A rumbling of engines and headlights follow as a freeway full of vehicles of every variety punches through a wall of dust, racing toward the diner. Vehicles swerve and collide, and dark shapes bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. Suddenly Howard's body is torn away from Sandra as something grabs his legs, waking Sandra and causing her to scream and hold on. Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms, with Jeep right behind them, ready to fire at the creature but unable to get a clear shot because the women are in the way. He discards the gun and helps grab Howard's arms as Howard screams and his body is torturously stretched in a human tug-of-war, lurching further out the window. Kyle looks around the roof with alarm as only a few more inches separate Charlie from certain death through the window, and Jeep is losing her. Charlie and Jeep fall back into the diner, with claw-like hands still grasping Charlie's arms, no longer attached to their owners. Michael leaps over her, wielding a butcher's knife in one hand and a machine gun in the other, as the window blinds turn into a wall of fire. Charlie flings the severed appendages off her, and she and Jeep scoot away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael to go after Howard, but he intercepts her before she can make it out. Sandra frantically slaps at Michael as he carries her away from the window and thrusts her down into a back booth. She's about to say something when Kyle rushes into the room with a smile on his face, but his excitement falls when he notices the broken window and takes in the room. Bob grabs Kyle's arm, and all eyes turn to Michael. Michael looks squarely at Percy, as Bob stares at him, uncertain how to respond, and Charlie reacts in shock as all eyes suddenly turn to her.",
    "725": "She swims across the water which nearly reaches the ceiling. She stops at the stairs, then turns. He swims to the stairs and they both climb. At the head of a crowd, Tommy and Fabrizio hop over a barrier. Crew members lift the lifeboat onto long oars set up like a ramp. Reaching to the deck, Murdoch rushes to a stairwell and stares down the churning water. Cal runs through a doorway. A man knocks him into a running crowd. Cal turns and runs with the others, then stops. He climbs a platform and peers over the crowd. Cal peers down at a crying young girl, then walks away. Inside, Rose and Jack run up a staircase. A man falls into the water, another dangles from the rope. Cal approaches. Murdoch pulls money from his pocket and flings it at Cal. Murdoch pushes Cal. A man leaps toward the lifeboat. Murdoch shoots at him. A man pushes Tommy forward. Murdoch shoots Tommy. Fabrizio kneels by Tommy. Murdoch gazes downward and steps back toward the edge of the ship. He looks to his right, then at the crowd of passengers. Cal glares at Murdoch. Murdoch stands at attention and salutes, then holds the gun to his own head. He fires and falls into the ocean. Cal turns and then runs to the crowd. On the other side of the ship, crew members tip another lifeboat onto the deck below. Cal picks up a crying girl, then steps toward the crowd of passengers. Cal hurries forward. Cal hands the girl to a woman, climbs into the lifeboat, and sits. The woman hands the girl to Cal. Jack and Rose run for the smoking room. Andrews stands by the fireplace, gazing at a painting. Andrews gives Rose his lifebelt. She hugs Andrews. Rose hurries through a revolving door. Jack glances back, nods, then follows Rose. Elsewhere, a steward holding two life belts hurries toward the Grand Staircase. Outside, a sailor rotates a winch as others work to turn over the top of the lifeboat. Captain Smith watches, then turns as a man wades through shallow water on deck. A woman holding a baby approaches the captain. Captain Smith stares at her, then turns and steps away. A man with a lifebelt runs up to the captain. The captain stops, glances at the lifebelt, then walks off. Knee-deep in water, he steps onto the bridge. Captain Smith gazes at a ship's wheel and various instruments, then steps into the wheelhouse and shuts the door. The string quartet finishes playing. Carrying their instruments, three of the quartet members walk away as people run past. Hartley, the violin player, places his instrument against his neck and resumes playing.",
    "1038": "Felipe perspires profusely and glowers intensely before clicking a red trigger with his thumb, causing the hotel lobby to explode. In the stairwell, Javier checks his watch, and outside, an ambulance hits the streets with Sam on its radio. A Secret Service agent heads downstairs, only to be shot by Javier. Javier watches more agents pass beneath him in the stairwell, then heads downstairs, easing a door open on level seven. He dons a ski mask, lurches through the doorway, and stabs an agent in the back. Another agent rounds the corner, and Javier attacks, killing the agent and drawing his gun. Meanwhile, Sam drives the ambulance through the streets at breakneck speed, careening through a junction and causing two cars to crash. Javier uses a mirror to spot two agents outside the President's room, then opens fire, shooting a third agent, and sets charges which blow the door to the President's room. He ducks inside and guns down Cavic, McCullough, and Heinkin before pointing his gun at Ashton. The ambulance arrives at the bombed hotel, and Veronica and Sam climb out. Sam taps his cell phone screen as the agent leads him away, and they kneel by a casualty. Barnes enters the GNN OB truck and flashes his ID as Veronica enters the elevator with a gurney and presses the button for level seven. Barnes makes a second call on his cell phone and spots Taylor on the monitor dressed as a cop. A flashback shows Taylor leaving Barnes and Howard, running off with a smirk, and entering the annex behind two agents as the bomb goes off outside. Taylor guns down both agents, sheds his jacket, dismantles the remote-controlled rifle, changes into a Spanish policeman's outfit, and heads down an outside staircase with the packed-up rifle. As Taylor leaves, Barnes spots him on the monitor, glares, and leaps into action, rushing out of the GNN truck. Taylor puts his cell phone into the front seat of the ambulance driven by Sam and Veronica and gets into a Spanish police car. As Barnes rounds a corner, he heads down a quiet street, sees Taylor speed off, and gives chase on foot through a narrow pedestrian street, then onto the main road, rushing into oncoming traffic. Barnes speeds off in a blue hatchback, gets on his cell phone, and slides around a corner. In the hotel, Javier forces Ashton towards the elevator on the seventh floor at gunpoint. Veronica arrives in the elevator and chloroforms Ashton; they put the unconscious President on the gurney, enter the elevator, and Veronica fits an oxygen mask onto Ashton's face while Javier points a gun at the President's head.",
    "481": "She sees the small alley at the end of the L of cabins and starts toward it. She looks ahead at the old house standing against the sky as Lila moves forward, and the CAMERA approaches the house. She moves on, and the house comes nearer. Lila looks up at the house and continues forward purposefully toward the house and the porch. Lila stops at the house and looks up, then turns to it again. The CAMERA MOUNTS the steps to the porch, and Lila's hand pushes the door open, revealing the hallway. Lila ENTERS PAST CAMERA, closes the door, and remains by it for a moment, quiet and listening. Meanwhile, Norman is behind the counter, standing and staring at Sam, who is sitting relaxedly on a small sofa. Lila is halfway up the stairs, and the CAMERA remains at the foot of the stair, TILTING UP as she climbs. She pauses at the head of the stair, observing the closed door to the mother's room on her right. There is a moment of quiet, then the door begins to open, and Lila stands on the threshold, looking in at the room, instantly disturbed by it, and almost chilled, with an expression indicating an impulse to close the door and go away from the room forever. After a moment, she enters, leaving the door open behind her. Inside, there is a four-poster bed without a canopy, a fancy and flounced satin dressing table, a great chiffonier, a big-doored wardrobe, a large oval full-length pier-glass against the wall directly opposite the door, a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair by the window, and a white marble fireplace with a grate cold but piled with ashes. Lila glances at the bed and, after staring at it for a moment, goes to the dressing table. She moves on, catches a glimpse of herself in the pier-glass, is startled, turns away, goes to the chiffonier, is about to open a drawer, sees the high wardrobe out of the corner of her eye, and goes to it hesitantly. She opens one door to see fresh, clean, well-pressed dresses hanging neatly. Lila comes out of the mother's room, closes the door behind her, looks down the stairs, then starts across the hall to the room with the half-open door. Lila pauses on the threshold, reaches in, feels the wall, and throws on a switch. Sam has risen and is standing by the counter now, turning his head to glance out the window at the old house. Lila goes into the room, goes to the chair, and touches it. The touch disturbs the figure, causing it to start turning slowly and stiffly in a clockwise movement. Lila looks at it in horror, realizing it is the body of a woman long dead.",
    "761": "He opens the door to a walk-in wardrobe, switches on the bare bulb, and feels under some folded jeans on a shelf above his head. He removes a piece of gray cloth from which a gun butt protrudes. He lays the cloth on his newspaper, unwraps the stubby, black revolver, looks at it, re-wraps it, and replaces it. Feeling under the jeans again, he removes a battered folder. He opens it and flips through old newspaper clippings about American football. A photo of a young David in football gear looks out from another story. He turns over more clippings, copies of the first stories, pages of sport results, and more photos of football matches. The personalities involved are disguised by their helmets and face guards until he comes to a picture of an overturned car. He stares at it frowning. He looks back at the picture of the car, obviously taken at night. It's lying just beyond a bend in a tree-lined road, upside down in a ditch. Its roof is crushed. He glances across the room, quickly closes, and replaces the folder under his jeans. Audrey is outside his door. She looks down. Her face crumbles, and she pushes her fists to her mouth. He watches her turn and start down the stairs before he shuts the door. In a huge football stadium, David is on duty holding a walkie-talkie in a white covered walkway. David and Elijah stroll beside the crowds, queuing to get in. David brushes past a tall, slim man wearing a pale, sandy green and gray camouflage jacket. A few paces further on, he looks back, eyes narrowed. When they move on again, Elijah, who's wearing a long black leather coat and his usual black gloves, and walking with the help of his stick, glances back too. David stops at the head of the queue and speaks to another security. The other guards start frisking the fans. The man with thinning hair and a black beard looks around. David and Elijah watch the slow-moving queue. Elijah, the taller of the two, stoops while leaning on his stick. The suspect reaches a break in the metal barriers, steps out of the queue, hand covering his mouth, and walks away against the flow of fans. David looks at Elijah, then away again. David grins at Elijah. David looks away again and nods. David holds up his walkie-talkie. David walks along the dark corridor. Elijah's glass walking stick lands on the seat of his car. The man in the camouflage jacket walks past the car. Elijah hobbles around the arched colonnade that encircles the stadium through alternate pools of light and shadows cast by the arches, but the man walks fast enough to disappear from sight around the curve of the building.",
    "1072": "He picks up something silky and holds it out, smiling apologetically. He passes water to the men on the truck's roof. Holding his dog, he looks at Sarah. She looks out of the passenger window. A kangaroo paw and a dribble of blood run down the windscreen. She peers in horror through her desert glasses, her net veil blowing in the breeze. The hunters lounge happily on top of the truck, which heads out across the flat, sandy desert. They drive along the top of a weir, across a wide river. At night, they camp around a fire. Drover is washing his muscled torso, using water from a bucket. Sarah pops her head out of her tent, staring as the water pours off his rippling muscles. They mime keeping each other warm, and she ducks back into her tent. He walks towards her with a raised eyebrow. He pulls down the waistband of his trousers suggestively. Camels pull a truck with no engine, watched by Goolaj and Magarri. A man falls off the vehicle. He lies in a heap in the dust. Later, he's in the truck next to the horrified Sarah. Drover nods. They drive on across a flat, dusty plain. They're bumping slowly along a rocky track. A girl runs up to them. The boy gallops on the horse, through the sparse trees. The boy arrives at Faraway Downs and reins in the horse, looking out at the approaching truck. The boy runs through the gate to the house and leaps over a fence. They just miss the horse, which rears up. Thick smoke obscures the house. As he loads, the boy climbs into the water tower. Drover walks through the smoke. The boy drops down inside the tower. Sarah sits uncomfortably next to the drunk Kipling. The smoke clears, revealing a large house. Kipling collapses. Drover, shrouded in smoke, walks past a dead cow. Sarah, jaw set, gets out of the truck. She stomps furiously towards the house, as Drover approaches a blazing funeral fire. He examines it thoughtfully and looks around. The boy stretches out his hands. An aboriginal is sitting on the ground. As she enters the house, women hold out buckets of smoking leaves. The boy poses mystically. Sarah strides past members of the household and sees her husband, dead on a table. She reels in shock. He's got a wound in the middle of his chest. His eyes stare glassily. She stares at the Chinese man and reaches out to close Maitland's eyes, but a man's hand does it for her. She eyes the man, her hand poised near Maitland's face. Members of staff hover in the corners of the room. The house is shrouded in a cloud of dust and smoke, a big blaze but tiny in the vast landscape.",
    "158": "Gandhi is approaching with Nehru and Azad, with Pyarelal trailing close behind. Azad and Pyarelal come out on the porch behind Nehru. As Gandhi nears the car, a Hindu youth with a black flag calls to him. They are all awed, timid even in his presence, and the mood of their gathering has changed altogether. Gandhi looks at the youth and the line of others, sweeping them sternly with his eyes, showing all his fatigue and strain. He lowers his head and moves on to the car, where Kallenbach holds the door for him, with Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal following. As they get into the car, we see the car that sits by the two trucks that have brought the youths. In the back seat are two men, one of whom is Prakash. Jinnah is on the small balcony of an elaborate room, looking down in a slightly supercilious manner, impeccably dressed as usual. He has been looking at Gandhi, who sits on the floor of the large room some distance from him, just lifting his head from prayers. Nehru, Patel, and Azad are on the same side of the room as Gandhi. They rise from prayer as Jinnah comes down the steps to them. Gandhi hesitates, then begins, and Jinnah has drawn himself up, his vanity too great not to be touched by that prospect. He measures Gandhi to see that he is sincere, and when satisfied, turns slowly to Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru glances at Patel, all taken by surprise by the offer and not feeling what Gandhi feels. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi. It bears the stamp of undeniable truth. Gandhi's eyes sag with despair, as if his last hope, his faith, has crumbled around him. Gandhi stares numbly at him. On a platform in the foreground, Mountbatten and Nehru are present as a band plays the Indian National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as India's flag is raised on the flagpole. On another platform, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are present as a band plays the new Pakistani National Anthem loudly, and there's the roar of a tremendous crowd as Pakistan's flag is raised. The little flagpole is empty, the rope dangling, flapping loosely down the pole. Gandhi sits on the porch of his bungalow, spinning, the hum of the spinning wheel audible. Inside, we can just see Mirabehn spinning too, but apart from that, he is alone; the whole ashram seems deserted.",
    "17": "Carolyn sits at a table, lost in thought, with two menus on the table. After a moment, Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King, joins her, and Carolyn immediately becomes warm and gracious. She smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name, and picks up her menu mechanically, continuing to stare at Buddy, enraptured. Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, videotaping a DEAD BIRD decomposing on the ground. The camera jerks up to discover Jane and Angela staring at us, and Angela looks at Jane, trying not to laugh, then falls out of frame as we zoom toward Jane. Ricky lowers the Digicam, and Angela starts off, but Jane doesn't follow while Ricky smiles at her. Angela stops and stares at her. In another scene, Carolyn and Buddy are in the middle of sex. Meanwhile, Lester is driving, smoking a joint in his TOYOTA CAMRY, cruising through the streets. Lester turns down the volume on the stereo, pulls the car around to the WINDOW, where a teenage GIRL wearing a headset is waiting, pays her, and notices a SIGN in the corner of the window as she hands him his food. Lester sits at a booth with the MANAGER, a greasy kid wearing a white short sleeve shirt and a tie covered with the Mr. Smiley's logo, who looks over Lester's application, baffled. Later, Carolyn and Buddy are in bed, post-sex, laughing. Carolyn sits up, eager to learn from the master, and quickly picks up her cue, kissing him and ready for another round. Ricky and Jane walk along without speaking; he seems comfortable with the silence while she doesn't. They stop walking and after a beat, an automobile FUNERAL PROCESSION appears and begins to pass them slowly, which they watch. Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space as if hypnotized, while Ricky enters, followed by Jane. Barbara's eyes flutter and she turns to him slowly, with Jane glancing around at the spotless room where GLASS CASES filled with GUNS line the walls. Ricky crosses to a built-in CABINET behind the desk, unlocks it, and opens it, revealing shelves stacked with WAR MEMORABILIA. He reaches into the cabinet, carefully removes an oval CHINA PLATTER, and hands it to Jane, who examines it closely. On the bottom of the plate, a small SWASTIKA is imprinted in the center. Ricky puts the platter back into the cabinet and shuts the door, noticing Jane looking at him oddly, and studies her. Finally, we're in an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day, with something floating across from us: an empty, wrinkled, white PLASTIC BAG.",
    "98": "Forrest continues to speak into the microphone as the crowd grows restless. Hilary plugs in the right patch cord, and Forrest looks at the massive crowd, who are silent. Abbie Hoffman steps over to Forrest, pats him on the shoulder, raises his fist into the air, and the crowd cheers. Abbie steps away from Forrest. Jenny wades out into the reflection pool and waves her hand into the air. Forrest recognizes her and rushes off the stage as Jenny makes her way out into the pool. Forrest jumps down into the crowd and runs. Jenny smiles as she tries to run through the water, and the crowd parts as Forrest runs into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him, and the massive crowd cheers for the embracing couple in the pool. Forrest and Jenny walk past the protesters who are camping out on the lawn. Forrest stands at an open window and looks at the White House. A Black Panther, named RUBEN, steps over and pulls the shades down. Another Black Panther named MASAI grabs Forrest and pats him down. Jenny rushes over to Forrest and pulls Forrest off Wesley. Jenny tries to help Wesley as he moans on the floor, but Wesley knocks Jenny's hand away and gets up, holding his bloody lip. Jenny steps out the door as Forrest picks up his hat, and the group of Black Panthers glare at Forrest. Forrest turns and walks out of the room as protesters hold a candlelight vigil behind them. Forrest and Jenny walk past the White House in silence. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform as she stands in the rain, hitchhiking. A car pulls over to pick her up, and Jenny and other girls get into the car. A hippie gives Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit in front of a roaring fire. Jenny and two other girls sing on the sidewalk and collect change from the passersby as Jenny plays the guitar. Forrest and Jenny walk through the park, and Jenny carries a backpack as she prepares to board a bus back to Berkeley. Forrest looks down at Jenny and pulls his Medal of Honor from around his neck, placing it in Jenny's hand. Jenny looks up at him, and they hug each other. Wesley waits for Jenny as she turns and walks up to him, and they walk toward the entrance of the bus. Forrest smiles as Jenny looks at him. Jenny climbs up into the bus, and Wesley glares at Forrest. Jenny, through the near window of the bus, knocks on the window. Forrest turns and looks as Jenny waves to him. Forrest looks up and smiles sadly. Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign as the bus pulls away, and Forrest gives Jenny the peace sign in return.",
    "67": "The dog yawns and shakes its head. The phone receiver slams into the cradle. The rumpled figure slowly sits up and remains motionless. He musses his hair and stands. The rumpled figure lays down on the bed. It is the face of Dante, and this is Dante's room; this is Dante's life. Dante grabs the dog and wrestles it. The dog licks water from the toilet. The dog stands and wags its tail. A towel-dressed Dante opens the fridge and peers inside. We now see his face. He grabs a half-empty gallon of milk and closes the door. One scoop, two scoops, three scoops, four scoops; chocolate milk mix is heaped into a tumbler. Dante gulps his breakfast. A hand grabs keys from atop a VCR. The car pulls up, with a screech. Feet descend to the ground from the open door. Keys jam into a lock and pop it open. Dante lifts the metal shutter revealing the door. Suddenly, the lights flick on, revealing the glorious interior of the convenience store. A very dark room is barely lit by the daylight. The cat looks at Dante as he passes the camera quickly. The paper bundle is snapped open with scissors. He opens it and grabs two bundles of papers, throwing them inside the store. One rack remains empty. Newspapers slam into the appropriate racks. A coffee filter is placed in a metal pot. Ground coffee follows, and the mix is shoved into place in the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked, and the machine comes to life. The empty newspaper rack with the heading Asbury Park Press seems out of place among all the other stacks of papers. Dante is puzzled and annoyed. He rolls his eyes as it occurs to him. He takes a step back to grab the coin. The register pops open, and a hand extracts a quarter. Through murky glass and thin metal grating, we see Dante approach. He stops and drops a quarter in the slot. He pulls the door down, finally allowing us a clear view as he reaches toward the camera. Dante pulls a stack of newspapers from the Asbury Park Press vending machine. He struggles to hold them all in one hand as he lets the door slam shut. He turns to walk away, but the sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot stops him. The papers drop into the once-empty rack with a resounding flop. The quarter drops back into the register drawer. The lock is gummed up with gum or something hard and obtrusive like gum, preventing the key from being inserted. Dante tries to jam the key into the window shutter lock. He looks down at it. Dante looks around and kicks the shutter angrily.",
    "1013": "The Queen looks at notes on the palace gates, one of which is a crying face, and after reading the third message, she looks down but turns to face the crowd with a grateful smile before turning back to the notes. She flinches, quickly composes herself, and moves on as the crowd of onlookers watches her looking at the flowers. The Queen looks increasingly upset as she tries to maintain her composure but keeps moving along, looking at more flowers and notes. She stops, turns back to the crowd, and smiles before walking up to the barriers to meet the people. Various young women stand at the front, and the Queen moves slowly along and smiles at them. She stops in front of a little girl who holds a bouquet of flowers, which the girl hands to the Queen, and the Queen smiles and continues to move along. A group of older women curtsy as the Queen passes them, and as she walks, Prince Philip follows close by, with more women curtsying as she moves along. In an ornate hall, Robin walks past some TV lighting and camera equipment and approaches the Queen, who sits on a sofa next to Philip. The Queen takes a pen from her purse and writes on a sheet of paper, walks to a nearby table, puts the sheet down, studies it for a moment, and then walks up to a podium that has been placed in front of a window. Philip strolls to another side of the room and watches the TV crew and the Queen as a young makeup woman applies powder to the Queen's nose with crowds visible outside the window. Video footage outside Buckingham Palace shows that the TV lights are set up inside a hall in Buckingham Palace. Back inside, Charles enters and stands next to Prince Philip, while the makeup woman finishes applying powder to the Queen's face. The Queen then puts on her spectacles, and Charles takes a seat while Prince Philip remains standing. Charles watches on a monitor while the Queen Mother, Tony, and Cherie are seen watching the broadcast on their TVs. Cherie turns to Tony with disbelief and gently shakes her head as Tony watches the TV intently while the Queen stares blankly into the TV camera. Video footage at night shows a procession of cars driving on a road lined with crowds of people, with camera flashes going off continuously. The crowds swarm around the vehicles as they slowly move along. On Saturday, a white helicopter flies through the clear daylight sky, and video footage shows a large park packed with thousands of people, with the crowd facing a pair of giant video screens that stand at one side of the park.",
    "22": "In a corner booth, four big Transit Authority police are having a meal together. Cheryl looks at his utensils. The manager comes over, gesturing to the table of police that he can handle it. All attention is on Melvin. Melvin looks at the police, sizes up the hopeless situation, and rises. Melvin, ever the sharp observer, looks from the cab to see slices of community life -- men in front of a bar, parents giving their child a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local store -- two young women discuss dating. Carol opens the door just as he arrives on her landing. She holds a container of ice, washcloths, and a thermometer. Melvin ignores the question, instead answering a charge he had imagined she might make. Spencer just stares at him. She closes the door in his face, then walks to her son and leads him back to his room. The camera moves toward mother and son sitting on the edge of Spencer's bed. She holds a digital thermometer to his ear. They both count down the seconds. As they settle in and drive off. As Carol enters the hospital. Verdell lies just inside the front door whimpering for Melvin. Jackie sits across from Simon's wheelchair. She has some index cards in her lap which she occasionally consults and shuffles. Simon forces his attention to Jackie as their conversation continues -- the dog is distressed. Verdell walks out on the terrace and looks off. He turns for. Verdell hides behind a chair. As Jackie looks at him then thumbs for a card, the woman is tall, attractive, etc. She nods, pissed, waves, and leaves. As Melvin waits, Zoe summons her moxie. The fan is jolted as the elevator doors open and close. A depleted, exhausted Carol approaches her home. She is suddenly wary. As Carol breaks into a run. As she bounds the stairs, comes to her apartment door, and jiggles with the keys, a strange prescient whimpering sound coming from her. As she enters the apartment, the worst confirmed, she moves down the narrow hallway, her innards squirting the same chemicals that drive elk on opening day of the hunting season. Beverly, Carol's mother, enters the room. She is ebullient which, if life allowed, would be her natural state. Bettes' reaction to her mother adds a saving grace. As we approach the doctor and Carol seated across from each other at a small table, Carol looks at her mother -- they share a laugh. Beverly has a hard time stopping. Simon practices walking using his cane. A tearstained Nora hugs him goodbye. Nora, holding her things, knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin opens the door. Nora is still sniffling.",
    "765": "The stock keeper man looks up from behind a counter at the far end of the shop and peers toward Elijah. He puts something away, walks out from the counter, and heads down the aisle towards Elijah. He has thick, curly hair, wears black jeans and a black Motorhead T-shirt. He stops halfway down the aisle. Joseph is playing with two toy figures, a caped superhero and a green reptilian villain. Audrey joins David, watching their son. David, who's been leaning on the wall behind Joseph, unfolds his arms and puts his hands in his pockets and looks at Audrey. In the shop, the assistant peers down at Elijah, his head swaying from side to side, looking for a reaction. Finally, he walks around to the back of Elijah's chair, takes the handles, and starts to wheel it down the aisle, maneuvering carefully between the heavily stacked shelves and displays. Suddenly, Elijah wrenches a wheel and the chair slews into a display, making magazines fall from it. The assistant looks at Elijah as if about to speak, his hands moving feebly, but Elijah, slumped in his chair, ignores him. The assistant starts pushing again until Elijah wrenches the other wheel, prompting the assistant to step back, raising his hands as if in surrender. He looks down at Elijah, who still stares sullenly ahead, and they set off again between the racks of comics and related toys. The assistant leaves Elijah by the display he's run into, where Elijah's hand, protected by a padded black mitten, carefully lifts it up. The cover shows a powerfully built hero in blue, racing towards a gaggle of shadowy demonic figures, and he holds it out towards the assistant who's at the counter on the telephone. Meanwhile, David and Audrey are sitting at a bar, facing each other and gazing at each other very still. The babysitter is present as David gives the girl money. She turns toward the door and sees the rain streaming down the window, throws a little brown jacket over her hair, and leaves. David runs his hand over his head while Audrey leans against the pillar at the foot of the stairs, looking at him, one hand holding his coat, the other in his pocket. She nods, turns, and goes. He throws his coat over the back of the sofa. The green light on the answering machine flashes in a dark room as David walks in from the unlit landing and presses a button. Outside, headlights blaze through the teeming rain as a car stops before a chain link fence. The driver's door opens and a caped and hooded figure walks to the fence, looks to his left, stands for a moment as a black shape against the headlights, hesitates, then grasps at links above his head and begins to climb.",
    "955": "They cycle by a road as Joe looks down awkwardly. The old yellow Coupe pulls up and Louis gets out, with Joe and Alice watching him intensely. Louis walks over to them, removes his shades, and, with heavy sideburns, steps inside the house, then immediately comes back out. Alice follows Louis back into the house, leaving an awkward looking Joe standing on the veranda, but she comes back out to Joe, who looks surprised and steps towards her. Filming a scene, Martin shoots zombie Cary as Alice watches, with the wrecked train in the distance behind them. Joe takes the camera and sets it up to film the crash site in the distance while news crew helicopters hover in the air above the scene. The film makers look down at the destruction, and Joe looks down with a troubled expression. At the crash site, Air Force personnel are busy clearing up the cargo of strange white cubes, repacking them into crates, which are loaded onto military lorries. Joe's dad Jack is there with Air Force Colonel Nelec, who goes, leaving Jack unsatisfied as he looks around and sees men carefully making a plaster of Paris mold. Back at the police station, he talks to Sheriff Pruitt, who goes, leaving Jack looking nonplussed. The sheriff drives his car into a gas station and pulls up by the pumps. He goes into the shop and finds the clerk playing with a new Sony Walkman; Breen can't hear him, so the sheriff lobs a candy bar at him. The sheriff pays for his petrol and the candy bar, then goes back outside, fills his patrol car, and opens the candy bar. His attention is caught by some odd noises and he looks around, surprised, as a pack of dogs runs across the filling station forecourt. The sheriff's patrol car starts malfunctioning, prompting him to check it out. Hearing something move nearby, the sheriff goes to investigate, keeping a hand on his gun. He nearly leaps out of his skin as a dumpster flies past him, while in the shop, Breen is oblivious as his Walkman drowns out all the sound. Over his shoulder, the sheriff's car jolts violently. Suddenly, the lights flicker and Breen looks round, pulling his headphones off as he looks out of the window. The lights continue flickering as Breen, looking apprehensive, slowly makes his way outside to find the front of the sheriff's car smashed in by a violent impact. Breen walks around the wrecked patrol car, observing steam rising from its ruptured radiator, and picks the petrol pump's nozzle out of a large pool of gasoline on the ground. Hearing something behind him, he turns around and looks completely terrified.",
    "968": "As the mustached stranger waits to cross a busy intersection, he checks his wristwatch, which reads 7:06. He makes a flicking motion, causing David's coffee to slosh. As the lovely woman wipes coffee off her legs, a taxi hits the stranger, and the cabbie stops his car to rush to the fallen man. The stranger opens the book, revealing a line traveling at right angles across a map. Outside, he watches the bus drive off, and his book shows the line moving towards a pulsing red dot. He runs after the bus, but on board, she tries to tip David's cup. She grabs his phone, answers, and drops it into his coffee, which bubbles as the phone rings. David extracts his phone and she wipes it on her skirt. Outside, the mustached stranger hurries across a street as the bus stops. Elise climbs off and turns to David, who stands in the doorway as the doors close. Elise grins at him through a window and, with a mocking frown, she flips him off. Smiling, he watches her head away, then sits again, placing his coffee in the seat beside him. He eyes Elise's number on the back of one of his business cards and makes a call, then hangs up. Later, he pushes the revolving door of an office building and enters a vacant lobby. As he passes between two waist-high security scanners, he holds his card to the top of one and strides to an elevator. Emerging in a reception area, the receptionist's gaze remains down, her hand holding a phone to her ear. As he steps past another receptionist, her eyes remain ahead. Hurrying past two men standing in a corridor and a third sitting in a waiting area, he enters the conference room. Inside, men in shiny black body suits and visored helmets work on his colleagues, who stand frozen in time. Two men scan Charlie's face with wand-like devices. Two men in hats look over, and one is the mustached stranger's superior. David races out, and glancing back, he sees the helmeted men close behind. Sprinting to the reception area, he passes his frozen coworkers as more men join the chase. David runs up some stairs, finding the lead man at the top. As David races down a corridor, the white-haired boss opens a door off the hall and walks through. Turning a corner, David sees the man in front of him, and taking another corridor, he finds the man waiting at its end. Several of the helmeted men close in, and David doubles back, hurrying into Charlie's office and locking the door. He closes a second door leading to a small conference room, then picks up a phone and waits.",
    "62": "Evelyn is wearing jeans that are lathered white on the inside of the thighs and laced with brown horsehair, as well as riding boots, and despite perspiring a little, she looks younger than she did in the office. Gittes is a little taken aback at seeing Evelyn as the Chinese Butler appears on the veranda, nods, and disappears. Evelyn sits at a glass-topped table, and Gittes joins her. The iced tea comes on a tray which Ramon sets down between them. Evelyn looks up, and Gittes smiles a little sheepishly and then laughs a little nervously, nodding. Gittes drives up a winding road, following a flood channel up into the parched hills, reaching the entrance to the reservoir where a rescue truck is parked. The chain link fence with its KEEP OUT sign is open, and there are people milling around. The reservoir is below, and Gittes' car is stopped by a couple of uniformed police. He fishes out one of Yelburton's cards from his handkerchief pocket and hands it to the guard, driving past through the gate along the reservoir. Gittes stops and gets out of the car, spotting a police car and an unmarked one, with several men with their backs turned, one talking quietly, staring down into the reservoir where other men in small skiffs are apparently dredging for something. One of the men turns and sees Gittes, visibly shocked, as Loach tries to ease him down the path, and at the sound of his raised voice, a man standing at the edge of the channel, talking to two boys in swimming trunks, turns around, resulting in both Gittes and Escobar registering considerable surprise at seeing one another. The men around them are extremely uneasy as they walk a couple of steps, with Gittes reaching into his pocket to pull out his cigarette case, to which Escobar nods and finally smiles. The other police, two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer, watch them. Escobar points down to the reservoir where a couple of men using poles with hooks are fishing about in the water and manage to hook something, revealing the soaking back of a man's coat, then start to pull the body into the skiff, standing over the body of Mulwray. Escobar has the sheet drawn back, then drops it as Evelyn nods. Escobar and Evelyn move a few feet to one side and whisper, almost as though they were trying to keep the corpse from hearing them, then move slowly toward the door. Evelyn looks at Escobar but doesn't know how to answer him, and Escobar nods while Gittes has been sitting on a wooden bench, smoking and listening.",
    "154": "Gandhi stands on the steps of Kingsley Hall in the East End of London, being greeted by a cheering crowd, with the now gray-haired Charlie Andrews beaming possessively at his side. Gandhi, dressed in his dhoti, waves to a small crowd as he enters the gates of Buckingham Palace. He takes his seat at the conference table among the formally dressed delegates, some Maharajahs elaborately so. A gavel is struck, and Ramsay MacDonald begins his opening address, wearing his white suit and black-ribboned pince-nez. Gandhi sits on a wicker chair with Nehru and Patel leaning against the railing, while Azad and Kripalani sit on the floor like Gandhi. As Gandhi winds up what he has done and starts to rise, he moves toward the steps, stops, and looks at Patel with a wry, gentle smile before looking at Jinnah and shrugging. Jinnah takes it less philosophically, and his eyes burn with anger as he watches Gandhi head for the young girl with the injured goat. Gandhi moves with the stream of passengers disembarking from the Third Class section, with Ba and Mirabehn struggling along behind him, accompanied by Desai and Pyarelal. A British captain stands before a full platoon of Indian troops, and as Gandhi approaches, a British Lt. Colonel and his Adjutant move out from one side of the troops. Gandhi stops, looks up at him and the troops, then shakes his head with a weary grin. The British Colonel signals back to the troops, and as a detail marches up, the colonel's adjutant speaks gently to Ba, who stares at him belligerently, leaving him flummoxed. The colonel and his adjutant stride toward the exit of the station, followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Gandhi, then another detail of six soldiers accompanying Ba, and another accompanying Mirabehn. A jeep driven by an American lieutenant with a woman dressed in an American War Correspondent's uniform, Margaret Bourke-White, as the passenger, bounces along the road. As the jeep passes the camera, the view pans to see the walls of a palace ahead, with Bourke-White staring at the palace, absorbing the experience with the appetite of her breed and her own particular sensitivity. Gandhi sits by a window that is grilled rather than barred, spinning in a shaft of light and looking off, as the sound of a camera click and the rustle of movement is heard, while his hair, only half-gray in London, is now white.",
    "1273": "She turns to Aberforth, and he nods. Hermione turns to face Harry, and they continue staring at the painting. Hermione screws up her eyes and peers closely, and they step back slightly. The girl resumes her position in the portrait, and the whole frame opens like a door, revealing the entrance to a tunnel. In the tunnel, Neville's face is bruised and battered. A painting with a gold frame reveals a long, dark passage with a pinprick of light in the distance. Neville turns to the others and opens the gold-framed painting. Neville steps aside, revealing Harry, who sees a hoard of students in a large room strung with hammocks. He steps down, and they take it in turn to hug him. Neville approaches a student, who runs to a radio. Harry shifts uncomfortably and turns to the expectant faces as Ginny Weasley rushes into the room, ignoring Ron. Everyone turns to Harry. At the grand staircase at Hogwarts, lines of students, closely watched by Death Eater Amycus Carrow, march across the courtyard and tramp down the staircase towards the great hall. Staff and students are assembled in the hall as Severus Snape strides between the rows and stands at the front. With Amycus Carrow and his sister, Alecto, on either side of him, Snape slowly turns to face the gathering. Students turn to each other as he stalks between them. The students who met Harry, including Cho, Ginny, and Seamus, stand looking at the floor. One student wearing a gown steps forward to stand in front of Snape. Ron, Hermione, the Weasleys, Shacklebolt, and Remus march in. Snape draws his wand, but Professor McGonagall pushes Harry aside and faces the headmaster. Those at the door also raise their wands. McGonagall fires a burst of energy, and Snape repels McGonagall's ferocious assault. The Carrows are hauled, hit by the deflected energy. Spinning, Snape twists his black cloak around himself and swirls up towards the high window. He flies off. Harry discards his gown as torches burn and students celebrate. Harry sits down suddenly, and McGonagall goes to him as the room darkens. Ashen-faced, Harry is wide-eyed and tense, and the students look up apprehensively. The sky is dark with ominous clouds, and McGonagall stares anxiously. Harry steps towards the screaming girl, then a second girl screams as the gray gloom vanishes and the flaming torches in the great hall burn brightly again. The students move away from Harry, but Ginny immediately moves protectively in front of him. Hermione steps up, as do more students. Filch, the caretaker, runs in, and Harry strides up to McGonagall. On his way out, Harry stops and then leads the way out of the hall. Characters abandon the portraits and scuttle away as students rush down the stairs. Harry fights his way up through them, handing Ron the Marauder's Map as he sets off again.",
    "692": "In a science lab, the small black globule slips off the microscope and makes a beeline for Peter, who traps it under a glass. Peter comes home, crosses to his Spider-Man suit hanging on a rail and reaches for it. He hesitates and looks down at the battered black trunk on the floor, crouches down, lifts the lid, and contemplates the black spider suit inside. Moments later, black-suited Spider-Man drops from a skyscraper, a thread flashes out from his wrist, and he swings across the city. An overturned taxi stands outside the blown open doors of a bank as Black Spider-Man lands on the street and sees a trail of sand slithering down the grating. Eddie Brock jumps out of a car, camera ready, as Black Spider-Man tears the heavy grill from the ground and smashes Brock's camera, then jumps down the manhole. Brock glares down the manhole shaft after Black-suited Spider-Man as escort cars start arriving and surreptitiously takes out another smaller camera. Flint Marko strides along the tracks of a subway tunnel, carrying two clear sacks of banknotes when a flash of light reveals Black Spider-Man crawling along the ceiling behind him. Flint turns and looks up, but the shaft of light vanishes, and he sees nothing before he turns and carries on walking as Black Spider-Man hovers upside down in front of him. Spider-Man gives Flint's fist, touches stripes on a train, and leaps on Flint, causing him to tumble off the track into a deep tunnel and drop the money onto a track far below. Black Spider-Man swings at Flint on a thread, but Flint takes him away to the park of a train. Black Spider-Man swings away to the gird as an archways, flying back to drop kick Flint into the side of a train, grinding Flint's head against the side of the passing train like cheese on a grater. Flint drops to his knees, briefly becomes Sandman, and sends Black Spider-Man ricocheting between two passing trains. Spider-Man thumps Flint, knocking sandy lumps out of his face, and both he and Flint fall down a white shaft, landing on a pipe halfway down, which breaks, causing Flint to land in a muddy puddle close to his money. He reaches for it, but his arm has turned to damp sand, and he recoils in horror, watching as his hand disintegrates. Above him, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge, swings down onto a huge water pipe, and tears up the pipe, causing jets of water to spring from the red holes. Flint watches in horror as a torrent of water sweeps him away down the concrete's loose, slamming him up against the grating as the water rushes past, dissolving his sandy body.",
    "1108": "The huge giant leaves the room, and Harry looks at him uncertainly, then shakes his head. A pure white landscape emerges as high-stepping white horses trot out of the snow-covered forest, drawing handsome sleighs full of students well-wrapped against the cold. In the Great Hall, now decorated with tall Christmas trees, the ceiling reflects the weather outside, and huge snowflakes float above the heads of the students sitting at the long, polished dining tables. Harry and Ron are sitting by themselves at the end of one of the tables when Hermione carries her meal down the hall and sits opposite them. She holds up two cakes. Later, followed by Harry, Ron peers around a statue in the corridor, makes sure the coast is clear, and lifts his crooked wand. Harry waves his wand, and the two cakes float into the air. Harry and Ron hide as Crabbe and Goyle appear with armfuls of cake. They see the floating cakes, grab them, and start to eat them, greedily smacking their lips and stuffing the cakes into their mouths. They suddenly stop chewing as their eyes roll up, and they both fall over backward and hit the floor. Later, in the girls' lavatory, Hermione fills three glasses and hands one to Harry and one to Ron. They look at their thick sludge suspiciously and put the hairs into the potion. Ron pulls a face, and clinking glasses, they all drink at once. Ron takes a swig and heads for the nearest cubicle, followed by Hermione. Harry drops his glass and clutches his stomach in agony. He staggers to the marble sink and leans on it. Looking down, he sees the skin on his hands begin to bulge and bubble, and when Harry looks into the mirror, his face is also erupting. As he watches, he gradually turns into podgy Goyle. He lifts his hand and touches his beefy face with plump fingers. Pleased with the transformation, Harry smiles, then turns and sees Ron coming out of the cubicle, transformed into fat-faced, dumpy Crabbe. They stare at each other. In a dark corridor, Percy Weasley spots them, and Draco Malfoy stares at Harry, then glares at Percy, giving him a withering look. In the Slytherin common room, Draco slumps onto a leather sofa. Looking around nervously, Harry and Ron sit opposite him. Ron clenches his fist, and Harry nudges Ron. Draco stares at Harry, then gets to his feet and looks down at him ominously. To Harry's relief, Draco backs off. Ron looks at Harry with surprise, picks up a small parcel, and shakes it. Harry shakes his head, and Draco puts the parcel in his pocket. Ron springs up, and Harry warns Ron, who looks at him in dismay as Harry touches his forehead where his scar is reappearing.",
    "601": "Harry gets up, takes something from the overhead luggage rack, goes out of the compartment, and walks along the corridor, hiding it behind his back. The train steams across a vast, brown landscape illuminated by the evening sun. Harry stops to let two girls pass and sees Draco in an open carriage with seats on either side, looking thoughtful as he glances down at the Peruvian Darkness Powder in his hand. Suddenly, darkness engulfs the carriage. Summoned by Pansy and Blaise, a surly boy with short-cropped hair, Draco sits down opposite them and glances up to see his briefcase move slightly on the luggage rack. As Hagrid stands swinging a lantern on the Hogwarts platform when the express pulls up, its headlight cuts through the darkness. Pansy and Blaise wait for Draco at the carriage door and finally leave their compartment, while Ron and Hermione leave theirs. Draco pulls his briefcase from the luggage rack, heads for the door to the next carriage, slides it shut, and pulls down the blind. All the blinds close, and something falls from the rack, crashing to the floor. Draco pulls off the invisibility cloak, revealing Harry immobilized and staring, stamps on him, flings the cloak back over Harry, and walks out of the carriage. He steps onto the almost deserted platform, glances along it, and steam rises as he walks away. Someone walks through the train, viewing it as if through a rose-tinted kaleidoscope, with pink and mauve shapes swirling. The carriage door opens, and it's Luna, wearing the blue and white Spectrespecs advertised in the Quibbler. She sees a cloud of silvery dust hovering above the floor and pulls out her wand. The invisibility cloak is removed, and Harry snaps out of the immobility spell as Luna raises her specs. Harry's nose is broken and bloody when they reach the school gates. Flitwick erects an invisible shield across the gates as Luna and Harry watch Draco snatch his walking stick from Filch, smirk at Harry, and walk away, with Snape following him. Luna raises her wand, and Harry's swollen and misshapen nose returns to normal, though blood remains on his upper lip, chin, and t-shirt. In the Great Hall, Ron is guzzling jelly and cream until Hermione hits him with a book, and Harry walks towards them. Dumbledore steps up to the lectern, a gilded owl on the front of it stretches its wings, and Ginny wipes blood from Harry's face. Professor Slughorn, in a gown and mortarboard, acknowledges the applause. Draco stares glumly ahead while Slytherins celebrate around him as the students glance at one another. Draco rests his chin on his hand, lost in thought, and remains seated.",
    "1060": "Jenny smiles as she looks around the glamorous hall and all the table lamps while Helen and Danny exchange a worried look. David glances at Jenny, who freezes, but then she smiles happily and applauds the singer, keeping her eyes on the stage. Danny and Helen talk together as Jenny watches the glamorous couple. As David looks at her, she glances back at him and smiles self-consciously, while Helen and Danny are completely wrapped up in one another. Jenny smiles at David, and they both laugh; she grins happily to herself. Later, Jenny arrives home, cautiously opens the door, and walks quietly in. Her mother is in the kitchen and gives a non-committal nod before returning to her casserole. Margarie glances over her shoulder, and Jenny trudges sadly from the kitchen. The next day, David waits by his car outside the school as Jenny hurries out, having changed out of her school uniform. They both grin as she gets into the passenger seat and David gets behind the wheel, driving the Bristol off to the auction. At the auction, Danny smiles knowingly as a woman shakes her head, while Jenny reaches with excitement and David grins. Later, at Danny's palatial place filled with art and luxury furniture, Helen turns and stares at Jenny, and they shake on something. Later, they're in David's car parked in a part of town with tall townhouses. David takes his hat and approaches a family waiting with baggage on the corner. Jenny smiles as she watches his easy manner while he slings a young lad under one arm and helps with the bags. David shows the family in through a wooden front door as an older woman peers out from behind some curtains, and Jenny looks up at her. Jenny leans forward, opens the glove box, takes out a packet of cigarettes, lights one, and watches David return to the car. Later, Jenny slumps onto her desk at home, looking stunned at her mother. She goes to a café with friends, where Graham cycles up and scrimmages, trying to laugh it off. Jenny emerges from her bedroom onto a landing and listens to her parents talking downstairs, looking wistful and suppressing a giggle. Helen is putting a scarf in Jenny's hair, and Jenny, now wearing Helen's little bright dress, smiles nervously. She wears a stylish coat and has her hair neatly done up as Danny and David stand and admire the effect. They drive through the countryside in David's Bristol, with the sun shining on the palatial stone buildings of Oxford, and Jenny stares at the spires. Helen shutters, and later they're in a pub, where Jenny grins and closes the book. Later, she is getting ready for bed, with David fully clothed on the bed, as she comes out of the bathroom.",
    "61": "Gittes drops it and finds a set of keys, an old phone book, and a menu from a Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel in 1913. He spots a shadow looming in front of the translucent pane and enters the room, followed by an anxious secretary. Gittes nods and follows Yelburton out through the outer office to his smaller office down the hall, which features a lacquered marlin mounted on the wall, a couple of pictures of Yelburton with yellowtail and other fish, and a small burgee of a fish with the initials A.C. tacked onto the wall. Gittes spots a card tray on Yelburton's desk, fishes a couple of cards off the tray, and puts them in his handkerchief pocket. As he goes out the door, he nearly runs into a man standing by the secretary's desk, about Gittes' age but taller and wider, dressed in a plain suit that fits him poorly. Mulvihill stares at Gittes with unblinking eyes, then moves toward him, shaking with fury, but Yelburton steps between them and rings the bell. A powerful Chinese butler with heavy hair and a half-jacket of gold on one tooth answers the door. Gittes hands the butler a card from his wallet, and the butler takes it and disappears, leaving Gittes standing in the doorway. Gittes stands and sweats, watching a Japanese gardener trim a hedge. A chauffeur is washing down a cream-colored Packard with a chamois, causing steam to rise off the hood, and the squeaking comes from the chamois. Gittes looks behind him as the Chinese butler gestures for him to follow. He follows, trying to check out the rooms as he goes, passing a maid cleaning in the den. They pass through French doors along a trellised walkway to a large pond with running water. After a moment, the gardener returns, smiles at Gittes, and probes into the pond, dropping the long probe after the waters recede, revealing the overflowing pond. It becomes very quiet except for the running water, leaving Gittes standing by the pond. There's something gleaming in the bottom of it, and the gardener nods before leaving, leaving Gittes staring at the gleaming object. Gittes notes it, looks at the tool the gardener was using, hesitates, and starts to probe into the pond himself, toward the gleaming object. He spots Evelyn rounding a turn and coming down the trellised pathway, so he casually belts the probe and holds onto it for poise.",
    "544": "The Sinister Man clicks his heels and bows quickly. Brody takes off his hat. The man turns and joins a Second Man. Brody and Sallah follow them. The Second Man overhears Sallah. He and his companion turn quickly. Sallah puts Brody's luggage down and glances at Brody. Sallah pats his clothing, searching for his papers. Sallah laughs and pulls out a newspaper. Brody looks confused. Sallah shows the newspaper to the Second Man. Sallah puts the newspaper in front of the Second Man's face, then punches him through the newspaper. Donovan leads Vogel out. The Nazi Guards follow. Once they are gone, Elsa turns to Indy. She runs her hand down the side of his face. Indy and Henry are still tied back-to-back, of course. Elsa bends to speak quietly into Indy's ear, which is near enough to Henry's ear. She smiles and kisses Indy passionately. Henry glances back and looks rather disappointed. Vogel appears to remind Elsa of her appointment. Elsa exits. Vogel stays behind for another moment. Vogel punches Indy in the jaw, a hard and vicious jab that snaps Indy's head around. Indy and Henry are pulling at the ropes with great urgency. Henry is able to wiggle his hand towards Indy's coat pocket. Indy squirms his body around towards Henry's hand. Henry's fingers open the lighter and ignite the flame. Henry yelps as the cigarette lighter burns his hand. He drops the lighter to the floor. Henry kicks at the lighter, trying to reach it, but cannot. The rug starts to burn. Finally, they turn their heads in the same direction. Indy struggles to free his hands. His foot kicks out and accidentally hits a metal grill that operates a Secret Door, where a Nazi Radioman wearing headphones sits at an elaborate panel of dials, switches, and meters, and a woman stands over a map plotting coordinates. Their backs are turned to Indy and Henry, inside the fireplace, still tied back-to-back. Indy's foot hits the grill again. Four Nazi Radiomen and the woman are still hard at work with controls and coordinates. Suddenly the woman looks up and spots Henry and Indy. She screams. Indy finally breaks free. All four Radiomen now have their guns drawn. They activate the lever and begin to rotate through the Secret Door. The Radiomen appear in the fireplace on the other side, but there is no sign of Indy and Henry. The Radiomen move cautiously toward the flame, shielding their faces with one hand, holding their guns with the other. They've hidden themselves up the chimney. And now they drop down, behind the Radiomen. One of the Radiomen grabs Indy by the neck. As they struggle, they fall against the rotating wall and disappear into the next room, leaving a frightened Henry behind.",
    "1156": "The sun breaks through the threatening storm clouds, illuminating words in spiky metal letters as the sun blazes down and a heat haze hangs over suburban London. Cars speed along a dual carriageway beside a field where the grass is scorched and dry. In a corner of the field is a neglected playground. A teenage boy, Harry Potter, walks across the field. In the playground, a boy gets off the roundabout, and everyone leaves. Harry sits on a swing lost in thought. He sees his cousin Dudley with his gang, and Harry pulls out his wand, holding it to Dudley's throat. The sky grows dark, and heavy storm clouds roll overhead, blocking out the sun as a strong wind rises, causing the gang to run off. Dudley and Harry look up as the sky grows even darker while the powerful wind blows flurries of waste paper across the playground, prompting them to run for shelter as the storm breaks and heavy rain begins to fall. Harry leads the way along a rutted cart track, with Dudley, who is overweight and finds it hard to keep up. Soaked to the skin, they find shelter in a long tunnel under the road and stop to catch their breath. Ahead of them, the grimy underpass is dimly lit by yellow lamps reflected in the puddles of water underfoot. The faulty lamps flicker and fizz, throwing an eerie yellow light along the tunnel, and the dingy concrete walls are covered with graffiti. They look around nervously, their breath visible in the icy air, when a cloaked figure swoops in and grabs Harry. As Dudley flees, his legs are knocked from under him, and an unseen force drags him along the ground. A second skeletal figure floats closer above his face. A Dementor hovers in front of Harry, forcing him against the wall with his bony fingers around his throat, attempting to suck out his life. Harry struggles desperately as a faint vapor is drawn from his face, while the second Dementor floats above Dudley, sucking vapor from him. Harry pulls out his wand and strikes his attacker, causing the Dementor to release him. Harry falls heavily, dropping his wand, but grabs it as the cloaked figure swoops again, and a powerful bright light hurls his attacker away. Dudley lies helpless beneath the other Dementor, and Harry uses his wand to hurl the dazzling light towards it, causing the creature to fly from the underpass. Traffic roars past on the road above as Harry runs to Dudley, who is semi-conscious and gasping for breath. An elderly woman wearing a plastic mac and rain hat enters the tunnel pulling a shopping trolley, prompting Harry to try and hide his wand. The elderly woman stops, and they walk home, with Harry half-carrying the stupefied Dudley to number four Privet Drive, where Aunt Petunia is watching television.",
    "1195": "Ron and Hermione follow the footprints in the snow until they reach the edge of the forest, and Ron hangs back as Hermione walks across a clearing in the trees towards the sound of crying. Falling snow deadens her footsteps. Kneeling beside her friend, Hermione puts out a hand and pulls off the invisibility cloak, revealing Harry, who looks at her miserably. A yellow butterfly flutters above the emerging snowdrops. The Whomping Willow twists its trunk and shakes the snow from its branches. In Lupin's room, Harry nods and grasps his wand. Unlocking a trunk, Lupin releases a Dementor, and Harry collapses into blackness. Chocolate. Harry nods again. Lupin opens the trunk, and a powerful silver mist flows from Harry's wand, shielding him from the terrifying power of the threatening Dementor. With determination and willpower, he gradually forces it to retreat inside the open trunk. Laughing with delight, Lupin slams down the lid. In the quadrangle, and then at the lake, Hagrid skims a stone, skims another, and then his face crumples as he hurls a stone into the water, distraught. The school corridors are dark and deserted. In the boys' dormitory, Harry is sitting up in bed eating a biscuit and reading the Marauder's Map by the light of his wand. Ron half-wakes from a bad dream, goes back to sleep. Harry tracks Filch the caretaker's footprints around the map, then spots another name, Peter Pettigrew, and he stares in surprise. Harry goes into the corridor, where an old man in a portrait shields his eyes from Harry's brightly lit wand. Harry consults the map, and as he walks along the corridor, his own name and footprints appear on the parchment. Moving cautiously, Harry shines the lighted wand into dark, empty corners and checks the map. Peter Pettigrew's footprints move erratically across the map, and Harry watches them as they run this way and that, then appear to be heading down the corridor straight towards him. He swings round in a panic, holding up the wand. He sees his own reflection in a mirror, and more portraits object to the light as Harry taps the map and puts out his wand. Snape points his lighted wand at Harry, who opens the map. Snape touches it with his wand, and writing appears on the parchment, grabbing the map. As Harry follows Lupin, the portraits glare at Snape. In a classroom, he indicates the Marauder's Map, and Lupin stares in disbelief. A crystal ball. Hermione knocks the crystal ball onto the floor, picks up her bag, and marches out of the room as the crystal ball rolls after her down the corridor. Later, on a circular staircase, carrying the crystal ball, Harry goes back up the stairs and along the corridor. He goes back into Professor Trelawney's cluttered classroom and looks around at the overstuffed furniture and shelves of teacups.",
    "786": "The light beams from a torch held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing Grecian style robes, and the logo fades away to black. A few flakes of snow gently flutter out of a night sky past a Christmas Tree made of fairy lights atop an establishment advertising itself as O'Hara's Pub, while a few people wander down the street, clutching gifts for their loved ones. Inside the pub, various groups of friends, families, and work colleagues have gathered together for a festive drink and to exchange presents. They chat and laugh, enjoying the Christmas spirit. At the far end of the bar, a seedy, unshaven man in his late 40s, wearing a Santa costume, sits alone, enjoying two glasses of an entirely different kind of spirit. Santa cuts a lonely figure as he sucks on a cigarette and calls over to the barman, then stares sadly at a group of people drinking a toast. Later, Santa lurches unsteadily up a snow-filled back alley, leans against the wall, and throws up. In a brightly lit shopping mall, a mother and her young children ride up an escalator, and at the top, one of the children stares in wonder at the lavish Santa's grotto that's been constructed. In the grotto, an elf hands a photo of a girl and Santa to her mother, and as the girl goes off, a boy of about eight walks up and sits on Santa's knee. Santa still looks seedy but has at least bothered to put his white beard on, and he shoves the boy away. A little later, Santa wets himself as his little helper wanders over. Santa pulls down his beard and swigs from a bottle of grog, then examines his pants, while his little helper shakes his head despairingly. The security guard says farewell to the last shoppers, and as Santa shuffles off, the guard keys a code into an alarm system. Up in the grotto, three snowmen sit behind statues of Mary and the baby Jesus in his crib, and the smallest snowman suddenly jumps up, but after a quick look to see the coast is clear, runs off, knocking Mary and Jesus over in the process. The snowman slides down between the escalators as the alarm system continues its arming countdown, crashes into a display at the bottom, and trots up to run through the shop. The snowman pulls the arm off of a mannequin as he goes and uses the arm to reach up and switch off the alarm before it can arm. The snowman pulls his head off, revealing Santa's profusely sweating little helper, and now in regular clothes, Santa's little helper opens a back door and finds Santa surrounded by empty beer cans.",
    "6": "Ricky walks into view, and Lester drapes his arm around Ricky as he gives him the money; from the waist up, Lester looks naked. Ricky, with wet hair from the rain, puts the cash in his pocket while Lester's arm remains draped around his shoulder. Grinning, Ricky squats down and reaches under the weight bench as Lester sits in the bowl chair, leans back with his hands behind his head, and watches Ricky roll the joint. From the Colonel's point of view, Lester leans back in his chair, and we can only see Ricky's back and shoulders as he rolls the joint, causing the Colonel's face to tighten. After a moment, Lester's jaw drops, and he throws his head back, making it appear as though Ricky is giving him a blow job from our perspective; the Colonel watches incredulously. Then, as we hear a car approaching, the Colonel glances over to see Angela's BMW pulling into the driveway, stopping behind Lester's Firebird. As Angela and Jane get out and run toward the house, our focus moves back to the garage window, where Ricky stands, looking a little panicked, as Lester pulls on his T-shirt and both he and Ricky cross out of view. Jane and Angela enter, with Jane frowning when she sees Lester, who leans nonchalantly against the counter, trying to remain cool and doing so successfully. Jane rolls her eyes and exits, while Angela walks over to Lester, placing her hand on his arm flirtatiously and looking up at him with a smile to intimidate him, but something has changed and he isn't intimidated. He looks directly at her, leans in, and smiles slowly, speaking in a low and intense voice, causing her to move away, suddenly insecure, and she heads out quickly with Lester watching her go, baffled. Ricky enters, wet from the pouring rain, crosses to his bureau, and pulls the wad of cash out of his pocket; he turns, startled, as the Colonel steps out of the shadows. The Colonel backhands Ricky so hard it sends him sprawling, but he gets up and eyes the Colonel, realizing he's discovered a way to break free from his father, incredulous at its simplicity. Ricky grabs his backpack, turns, and walks out the door, leaving the Colonel standing there, glassy-eyed and breathing heavily. Ricky enters another room to find Barbara standing in the middle, clutching a dish and looking frightened, having obviously heard his argument with his father; she looks into his eyes, aware something eventful is happening. He kisses her cheek softly, then exits through the back door, leaving her standing alone, still clutching her dish. From the Colonel's point of view, below him, Ricky dashes through the rain to the Burnhams' front door and knocks.",
    "561": "Indy blows dust away from the tile and tries to pry it up but cannot. He then rushes past Brody to a cordon held by a brass stand underneath the stained-glass window. Indy raises the brass stand and, timing his actions, hits the tile precisely as the Librarian stamps a book. The Librarian regards the stamper curiously while Indy continues to pound at the tile as the Librarian resumes his stamping, still puzzled by the sound echoing through the library. Finally, Indy breaks the tile. As he bends to remove the pieces of broken tile, a two-foot square hole is revealed. Indy is impressed with Elsa's spirit and cooperates agreeably, holding her by the hands and lowering her into the hole. When her feet finally touch ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and slips the Grail Diary to Brody. Then Indy disappears into the hole and jumps down a steep step. He reaches back to help Elsa, and they glance around, noticing the dark and dank surroundings. Elsa removes a cigarette lighter with a unique ivory four-leaf clover design, and Indy and Elsa inspect markings carved onto the walls. Indy takes the lighter from her and lights their way down a dark passageway. Three men carrying guns make their way down the spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting Brody, and one of the men, Kazim, raises his gun and brings it down hard on Brody's head. Indy only has to give it a quick glance to know and holds the lighter up as he and Elsa enter another dark passageway. Indy steps to the wall and runs his hand over the stone, then Elsa holds the lighter as Indy rams his shoulder into the wall. The wall collapses on impact, and Indy falls through into another room onto rocks surrounded by bubbling, green, slimy liquid. More skeletons surround him, resting in their carved niches, as Elsa holds the lighter and peers in at him through the hole in the wall. Indy reaches up, tears a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which breaks apart and falls into the oil-slick water. He uses the scrap of cloth and a bone to fashion a crude torch, which he then dips into the oily water. Using the cloth-wrapped bone torch to guide their way, Indy and Elsa come upon a narrow passageway with water knee-deep and teeming with rats, thousands of them crawling on one another's backs and thrashing in the water. Elsa gasps as the rats scamper between her legs, and Indy moves forward through the rat-infested water as Elsa follows, still gasping in horror. Suddenly, Indy slips into a hole, and recovering his balance, he reaches out to Elsa.",
    "38": "Annina runs up to him and hugs him. He looks over and sees Rick. At the bar, Carl whispers in Sacha's ear. He kisses Rick on both cheeks. Carl pours a brandy for Rick. Pretending not to do so, Rick glances in Ilsa's direction. Renault comes up to him. He smiles and walks away. Laszlo comes up to Rick. Rick gets up, as does Laszlo. Laszlo looks at him, puzzled. Rick and Laszlo hear male voices singing downstairs. Rick stands at the balcony outside his office and watches the Germans below. At the bar, Renault watches with raised eyebrow. Laszlo's lips are very tight as he listens to the song. He starts down the step. Yvonne, sitting at a table with her German officer, stares down into her drink. Laszlo speaks to the orchestra. Laszlo passes the table where Ilsa sits and goes straight to the orchestra. Members of the orchestra glance toward the steps, toward Rick, who nods to them. Laszlo and Corina sing as they start to play. Strasser conducts the German singing in an attempt to drown out the competition. After a while, Strasser and his officers give up and sit down. Yvonne jumps up and sings with tears in her eyes. Ilsa, overcome with emotion, looks proudly at Laszlo, who sings with passion. Finally the whole cafe stands, singing, their faces aglow. The song finishes on a high, triumphant note. Yvonne's face is exalted. She shouts at the top of her lungs. She deliberately faces the alcove where the Germans are watching. Several French officers surround Laszlo, offering him a drink. Renault thinks a moment, then blows a loud blast on his whistle. The room grows quiet, all eyes turn toward Renault. An angry murmur starts among the crowd. People get up and begin to leave. Rick comes quickly up to Renault. This display of nerve leaves Rick at a loss. The croupier comes out of the gambling room and up to Renault. He hands him a roll of bills. His manner is abrupt but cordial. As the cafe empties, Strasser approaches Ilsa. She looks at him, understanding what he means. He bows and exits as Laszlo arrives at the table. They start out of the cafe. Ilsa and Laszlo walk to their room. Laszlo switches on the light as they enter. While Ilsa takes off some jewelry, he walks to the window and peers out into the darkness. Below and across the street, a man stands under an arch. Laszlo watches him, then draws down the shade. He crosses to a table, takes a cigarette from a box, and strikes a match. He lights the cigarette. Ilsa is now noticeably uncomfortable. Ilsa walks over to the couch and sits down.",

Thorwald fights to dislodge Jeff's grip. Looking down on Jeff's face, showing his strain and the pain of Thorwald's attack. Doyle pulls himself to the top of the wall. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff is hanging out the window and Thorwald is hammering at his hands and arms with bare fists. Thorwald and Jeff are struggling. Doyle reaches the top of the wall and looks up at Jeff. Jeff, as seen from Doyle's angle, is hanging, somehow weathering Thorwald's insane attack. Jeff's grip begins to slip. Lisa is white-faced and frightened. He opens his eyes. Winces with pain. Doyle then looks up to the detective. Stella tugs at Doyle's arm and stands on tiptoe to whisper something into his ear. Doyle turns quizzically at Stella. Beginning on Jeff's window thermometer, the CAMERA PANS FROM RIGHT TO LEFT around the neighborhood. In the songwriter's apartment, we see the songwriter with a guest—Miss Lonely Hearts. The songwriter is placing the first recording of his new song on a record player for her to hear. Both in dress and manner she seems quite happy and adjusted to life. It is a full symphonic arrangement which is heard over. Thorwald's apartment is empty, stripped of its furnishings. Two painters are repainting the walls. The siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape, training a new white dog to ride in their basket. Miss Torso is practicing her ballet again; she wears a white leotard. The sound of someone at the door interrupts her. She goes to the door, opens it an inch or two cautiously. When she sees who is outside, she throws open the door. An innocuous, unhandsome and somewhat shy army private enters with a barracks bag slung over one shoulder. She kisses him fondly after closing the door. He puts down the barracks bag, tosses his hat into a chair and, with the attitude of a man who belongs there, goes to the icebox to see what's to eat. The newlyweds are arguing. The CAMERA PANS past Jeff who is asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window. CAMERA MOVES DOWN to the lower part of his body and we see that both his legs are now in casts. The CAMERA LIFTS SLIGHTLY to show Lisa sitting on the sofa nearby.

Suze pushes a stack of bills across the kitchen table towards Rebecca, who pushes them back, and then the girls knock back shots and run out into the street. Rebecca falls off her bed as they run to a post box, where a bag lady comes by with a packed supermarket trolley. The next day, Rebecca is at a flea market with her mom, Jane, and dad, Graham, where her dad performs a magic trick. The scene includes a waistcoat and Rebecca’s phone as she goes up in the lift of the Dantay-West building. Just after a postie wheels in a post trolley through the glass door, Rebecca spots her pink envelope among the stacks of mail. When the lift opens up and a man wheels out a clothes rail, she steps aside to let him pass, then ducks down behind it to get through the door. Rebecca slips an arm into a coat hanging on the rail and tries to reach the letter, attempting to hook it with a stiletto heel and swinging at the post trolley with the shoe. She hides in a blue fur as Alette strides off, and the clothes rail is wheeled away, leaving Rebecca lying on the floor, clutching her letter. Rebecca looks from Alicia to the clothes rail and some fashion stills along the wall, sits on a creaky chair, and sharpens her pencil as the prim PA giggles. Luke peers oddly at Rebecca, and she turns towards Haley, trying to follow his gaze. Hayley beams inanely as he leans forward. Rebecca and Suze are in a bookshop where she tries to copy from a book, then they watch a DVD at home. Rebecca packs clothes into plastic bags and stuffs them into a cupboard, closing the cupboard that's full to bursting as mannequins try to lure her. At the office, Rebecca, wearing pink, bends the article, turns to her pink laptop, and types something in Google, then leans forward to read what's popped up as the corner of his mouth drops. At a conference, all eyes are on Rebecca, who gulps nervously as Luke smiles like a Cheshire cat, Mr. Xander looks cornered, and Luke grins, having not meant for her to say that. Rebecca beams with newfound optimism, and as she strides down a street, a piece of paper floats down towards her and lands on her chest; it’s a flier for a sample sale. In his penthouse, Luke's boss, Ryan, slams a virtual golf ball at a virtual golf course. Rebecca is in the queue for the sample sale as women emerge from a door and stride past with their purchases. Then, another door opens, and the women in the queue jerk their heads.",
    "435": "His eyes travel to the window. Don, with his back toward Wick, is bent over the suitcase, packing and has crossed to the chest of drawers to fish out more shirts and socks. Bent forward tensely, he watches Wick go into the living room. Left alone, he acts with lightning rapidity, taking the sweater, going over to the window, pulling up the whiskey bottle, and wrapping the sweater around it so that only the top with the string around it shows. He tries to loosen the noose but, nervous, loses a precious second. From the living room comes the sound of Wick opening the closet door and ransacking. Don sees he can't loosen the string in time and in the last fraction of a second before Wick enters, he manages to lower the bottle back down the wall. With what nonchalance he can muster, he bends down and looks under the bed just as Wick enters with a sheaf of white paper in his hand. Wick pulls out a Remington portable, 1930 model, and puts it in Don's suitcase. He goes toward the door while the bell resumes short, short, long, short, and from the bedroom, we see him open the door. Helen enters breathlessly, crossing to the bedroom. She is a clean-cut, good-looking girl of twenty-six with two books wrapped and another small package in hand. Her face is brave, gay, and piquant. She's wearing a three-quarter-length leopard coat, despite the Indian Summer day being a good ten degrees too warm for it. She puts the packages in the suitcase, indicating a running gag between them. Don bends so she can kiss him on the cheek, and she does so. His face is now close to hers, and something flickers in Don's eye. Wick looks up, and there is an exchange of suspicious looks between Wick and Helen. Wick, who has been smoking a cigarette throughout the scene, throws it out the window, but it doesn't fall out the window; instead, it ricochets against the opened casement to the window sill, where it lies smouldering. Furious, Don takes a bunch of keys from his pocket, and his eyes fall on the cigarette still smouldering on the sill. Wick turns away and goes toward the window while Don, held by Helen, watches him tensely. Wick flips the cigarette into the garden and is about to turn back into the room when his eyes fall on the cleat and the string. He leans from the window, and Helen, sensing something amiss, looks from one brother to the other. Don lets Helen go, staring at Wick, panic in his eyes.",
    "54": "Gittes reaches into his desk and pulls out a shot glass, quickly selects a cheaper bottle of bourbon from several fifths of more expensive whiskeys and pours a large shot. He shoves the glass across his desk toward Curly, who stares dumbly at it, then picks it up and drains it. He's now walking Curly past Sophie, who pointedly averts her gaze. Gittes throws an arm around Curly and flashes a dazzling smile, then shuts the door on him and the smile disappears. Walsh rises when Gittes enters, Gittes nods and walks on in. Gittes walks over to Mrs. Mulwray and again flashes a warm, sympathetic smile, and she holds her breath. Gittes pulls up a chair sitting next to Mrs. Mulwray between Duffy and Walsh, gives Duffy an irritated glance, causing Duffy to stop chewing, and then Gittes sighs. Former Mayor Sam Bagby is speaking, with a huge map, overleafs, and bold lettering behind him. Some councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking, and some grubby farmers sit next to them, bored. One yawns and edges away from one of the dirtier farmers, while an amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees listen with keen interest. A man looks up with interest from his racing form during a whispered conference, walks to the huge map with overleafs, and he is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man and nods, prompting the man to turn the overleaf on the map. Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly, there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers, and a red-faced farmer drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray. The sun blazes off the river's ugly concrete banks, while where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds. After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls into view on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Someone holding a pair of binoculars is positioned downstream and just above the flood control road, using some dried mustard weeds for cover, and trains the binoculars on him. They watch while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed, where he stops, turns slowly, and appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed or at nothing at all. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed and into Gittes' view. Gittes moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks.",
    "621": "As she runs up to the Lorings' front door, she smoothes down the hem of the skirt she wears over her jeans and peers in through one of the two oval leaded windows. She shows Mark the image. Mark seems to lose himself in the music, then he looks at Juno. Juno notices a VHS. He snatches the tape from her, and they watch the film where a sinister man drives a stake through a woman's stomach. Juno shows Vanessa the picture, and Vanessa studies the image lengthwise and sideways, then looks across at Mark, who shrugs brutally. Vanessa stands with her arms tightly folded. He places Juno's bag over her shoulder and opens the door to let her out. Vanessa gives her husband a tight smile. It's dark by the time Juno arrives home, sipping from a drinks carton. Bren is cutting out pictures of dogs, and as Bren goes back to her paper dogs, Juno pours the dregs of her drink into Bren's ornament. Outside, on the snowy street, Juno stops the Previa and eases off her grey overskirt. Bleeker's mother opens her front door, and Juno races up the stairs, outrunning Bleeker's mother and getting to Bleeker's room before her. Bleeker reaches for a box. Juno eases herself into a chair with her legs apart and slides onto the floor next to him. They both look away awkwardly, and Juno suddenly looks glum. At her home, Vanessa, in an old T-shirt with her hair pulled back in a ponytail, stands before a bare wall. Mark, standing next to her with his arms folded, looks glum. Playing nervously with the chain around her neck, Vanessa turns to the wall behind her, and Mark stares bleakly at the wall. Juno and Leah are in the mall, crouching down behind a glass balcony. Vanessa is joking around with a friend's little girl in the mall play area. Leah sucks in her cheeks, stands up, and looks elsewhere, but Juno stays where she is, gazing down at Vanessa playing with the little girl, and a soft smile spreads across her face. They walk into Vanessa, who shakes her head in awe. Juno winces and then plants Vanessa's hand on her belly. Vanessa shakes her head, and her beautiful sculpted face tightens self-consciously. Then, she drops to her knees in front of Juno, and with a nervous glance about her, she places her hands on Juno's belly. Her eyes widen excitedly, and Juno, standing over her, watches her with a mixture of fondness and pride as Vanessa gazes at the swollen belly like a love-struck puppy. Bren, at the sewing machine, cuts the top of a pair of jeans and sews on an elasticated band, giving a satisfied smile as she tests the elastic.",
    "1192": "Each singer in the front row holds a huge toad as Professor Lupin stands and nods to the students, while Hagrid, the huge giant, stands up, knocking into the table and extinguishing a candle that relights itself before he leaves the Hall. Harry and his friends climb the moving staircase towards a portrait of a fat lady holding a glass and singing, which she smashes against a pillar. The portrait swings back, and they go into the common room where a ghost walks through them, and the boys try magic sweets. Neville chews the sweet, Ron tries one, and steam shoots from Harry's ears. Outside the window, the rain lashes down and lightning flashes as the storm rages around Hogwarts Castle, with black-cloaked Dementors hovering outside the school grounds. A small bird flies along the stone cloister, swoops down a grassy slope towards a crooked willow tree, which pulls back a branch and thwacks the bird, causing feathers to fly. In a classroom, she recoils, then outside the school, the students follow Hagrid around the edge of the sunlit forest to a grassy clearing surrounded by a low wall where Malfoy strokes his monster book, which purrs contentedly. Malfoy slowly approaches Harry, stares at him arrogantly, then, looking terrified, points over Harry's shoulder, and Harry spins round as his cronies pull up their hooded cloaks. Neville looks bedraggled next to a magnificent creature that stands in front of them, and all but Harry step back as Ron gives Harry a push. Nervously, Harry moves forward and bows to the creature, which flaps its huge wings and bows its birdlike head. Hagrid throws a tidbit while Malfoy pushes to the front, and Harry stretches out his hand as Hermione clutches Ron's hand and they both look embarrassed. Harry pats the creature, and as Hagrid smacks its hindquarters, it raises its huge wings and takes off while Harry hangs on desperately to Buckbeak's feathery neck, the four-legged creature, half-horse, half-eagle, rising above the trees. In the distance, Harry sees a river winding its way down the valley, the strong wings of the hippogriff carrying them even higher as they sail between the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School and soar above the craggy hillside. The silvery sun filters down through the storm clouds, turning the waters of a vast lake below them to a steely gray as Harry, clinging to the creature's neck, sees his reflection in the water while Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one huge claw just touching the surface. Harry relaxes, enjoying the sensation with a huge smile crossing his face, and spreads his arms wide but then grabs hold of the feathery neck once more as the huge wings lift them up and away from the lake. At last, Hagrid calls them back, and the hippogriff soars down through the treetops, flaps its wings as a brake, and lands in a clearing.",
    "855": "Charlie, wearing a name badge, saunters over as Sandra smiles through gritted teeth. The door opens, and Jeep walks in, heading to the kitchen, where a steak is covered with flies. Charlie's smile fades, and she glares as everyone turns to the dear, sweet old lady. Charlie slams down the bill and goes to the kitchen. Jeep looks across at the old lady and begins to walk towards her, noticing her rare steak is covered with flies as she cuts into it. Audrey grins as Gladys bites a chunk from Howard's neck, causing him to fall to the floor. Gladys tips her table, Percy grabs a frying pan, and throws it at Gladys, hitting her. She straightens up, a gash in her cheek, her eyes dark, and charges across the diner, leaping onto the window blinds and scuttling up them to the inverted V-shaped ceiling, which she scampers over. Bob fires a pump-action shotgun, but she leaps in front of him and swats him away; the shotgun falls to the floor in front of Jeep, who picks it up as Gladys approaches. Jeep closes his eyes, and Gladys slows to a halt at his feet without him firing. He looks up to see Kyle holding a smoking pistol as Howard lies in a puddle of blood on the floor, gasping for breath, and Sandra runs to him, her hands covered in his blood. Kyle puts the gun in his waistband and runs over, placing a napkin and his scarf over Howard's wound. Audrey, sitting on a bench seat, hugs her knees and shivers as blood drips from the ceiling onto her head, spotting two stains above her. Percy and Kyle haul Howard to the SUV, dragging his toes on the ground, and load him into the back with Sandra and Audrey. The SUV reverses, then goes back onto the road, heading for the dark cloud in the distance. Audrey spots the dark cloud on the road, which looks like smoke spreading upwards, as a fly comes in through a grill, and others splat into the windscreen. Flies storm in through the grill by the thousands. In the men's room at the diner, Jeep throws up in a cubicle as Bob stands by a nearby sink, drinking from a can. Bob sees Jeep's reflection in the mirror and pats Jeep's shoulder, then turns when he hears a car as the others return. He grabs Percy, looks up as Percy rushes inside, and sees a giant storm of flies looming overhead, darkening the sky above him. He retreats inside, where the gruesome face of old Gladys is uncovered from under a plastic sheet. Bob and Jeep, along with Kyle, carry Gladys out and watch the approaching police squad car as Kyle turns to Jeep, then Bob.",
    "999": "High up on a skyscraper, a workman hammers a steel girder, and sparks fly. Nick wakes up in his underwear, curled up on the porch swing outside his cottage, as Gatsby watches from a window. Nick receives a personal invitation, and cars loaded with party goers roll up to Gatsby's immense mansion, which is lit up at night, with a fountain in front. Cars crammed with people arrive, and Nick walks up, holding his invitation, getting caught up in the tide of people surging towards the mansion. Hundreds of people move towards a cavernous ballroom, where a spot-lit dancer twirls enormous multicolored feathers. A giant, dome-shaped crystal chandelier glitters, and standing on a raised platform is a large pipe organ. A flood-lit blue pool sits in the middle of the ballroom as Nick wanders about, smiling. A dancer hangs upside-down from the ceiling, and someone plays the massive organ. People dance everywhere, and Nick talks to a barman before downing a martini in one. He wears beige boots, white trousers and shirt, a dark-blue blazer, and a bowtie. Two flapper girls in flouncy yellow dresses do the Charleston with a man who's standing on a podium. An extremely attractive young woman glides through the proceedings, and Nick turns to Jordan, who takes off her hat. Gilda shimmies across the dance floor in a cream flapper dress with tiers of tassels. She pushes her hands out, spins and kicks, her tassels swishing and swaying as she moves frenetically. The dance floor fills, and Nick and Jordan walk upstairs. At the top of the stairs, Jordan leans sharply to Nick, then leans against doors, and Nick pushes her, and they tumble into a library. The old man comes down the library steps and hands them drinks. They look through a window down at the party, which throbs as people dance crazily. Colorful confetti floats down from the ceiling, the band wear red fezzes, and people jump into the round pool for a dip. Back amongst the throng, Nick holds his hand out to Jordan, who's dancing with Teddy Barton. Nick pulls her away from Teddy, a chiseled young man with slicked hair. Jordan flops her arms over Nick's shoulders, and they shimmy on the circular platform over the middle of the pool as glittering strings fly through the air. Teddy grabs Jordan's hand, and Jordan turns back to Nick, who looks miffed. The man turns to Nick, smiling, and Nick gawks at Gatsby, a handsome, fine-featured man with bright eyes and swept-back, wavy brown hair. Gatsby talks to Jordan, kisses her hand, and squeezes Nick's shoulder as fireworks light up the sky. Gatsby nods to them both and goes, and Jordan smiles and turns to Nick. The older, distinguished-looking man, Herzog, leaves Jordan looking bewildered. Gatsby watches from the top of the stairs for a moment, then walks away.",
    "1388": "Harry has donned Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat to disguise himself as Fudge looks around nervously and then jerks his head toward the pub. As he leads Rosmerta and McGonagall inside, we cut back to Hermione and Ron. Footprints track through the snow into the pub, as Ron and Hermione ripple briefly past a frosted window. Three shrunken heads swing into view while Rosmerta looks to McGonagall, who nods grimly. Suddenly, the pub doors fly open, revealing Main Street, where Ron and Hermione wait, rubbing their hands against the chill. As they look down, the camera tilts and footprints appear in the snow, marking the end of Harry's point of view. At the end of a rocky outcrop, the footprints end and sobs are heard. Ron takes Hermione's arm to discourage her from going further, but she does, filling the footprints with her own, then kneeling and gently drawing the cloak from Harry, who stares into the mist with eyes stinging with tears. Butterflies flutter over the great green lawn, the giant squid breaks through the last glaze of ice on the Black Lake, and the Whomping Willow shakes the water from its branches as the dying sun streams through high windows, painting Harry's face a fierce amber-red as he stands opposite Lupin. Ancient charts drape the walls while gleaming spheres of spun glass orbit one another silently, and Lupin paces before a large trunk. Harry shakes his head, and as his eyes wander, Lupin snaps his fingers to bring his attention back, then nods. Crack! The Dementor mutates into a silvery white orb, and Harry glances toward the window at the bloody sun, then looks up into Lupin's eyes, emotional, and nods. Harry takes a breath as Lupin blinks at Harry's quiet fierceness and opens the packing case, instantly causing the Dementor to appear again. The hair skates off Harry's scar as he sets his jaw, his hand trembling, and his whole body trembling, but he holds his ground when a huge silver shadow bursts from the end of his wand, hovering between him and the Dementor, which falters. Lupin nods as all the boys are asleep except Harry, who lies in bed studying the photo of his parents, barely visible in the fluttering light of a guttering candle. The camera begins to move, creeping forward, but it's only an old man in a painting, scowling in the glare of Harry's wand light. Harry makes to follow, then stops as the wand's spot dances across the parchment and finds another dot. Harry stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and turns into the harsh glare of Snape's wand. A sneer curdles the corners of Snape's lips as he eyes Harry coldly, lowering his wand. Seeing the map, Snape's eyes glitter, and to Harry's horror, words begin to appear as Snape studies him with a sadistic half-smile on his lips.",
    "23": "He closes the door in her face, and she stands there, thrown by the abruptness, pausing briefly outside Simon's door before continuing on her way. The doctor is gone, and mother and daughter are arguing. He grunts with pain, hope, and anxiety as he answers. Simon wheels away from Melvin and Simon is in a wheelchair. Melvin pauses as Simon weeps. Simon swings his arm and cast at Melvin—the sudden attack jolts Melvin, but not as much as what follows. Melvin heads for the door but Simon blocks him. Verdell looks at Simon with concern. As Simon works to stop crying, Melvin is weird with discomfort. Simon looks up, his mood changing quickly, and he's rapt, looking apologetically at Simon in stoic ruin. Carol lies in bed on the pullout sofa. She walks to the kitchen, trembling as she drinks a glass of water and exits. Carol crosses to Manhattan, looking like she's on her way to a final exam where she has no idea of the subject. On a hot summer night, she gets off the bus as the rains come. As Carol consults the slip of paper with the address on it, she enters the building and realizes her thin summer dress is clinging to her like an old movie poster of The Deep. She stands in front of Melvin's apartment, twists herself to ease nervousness, and knocks on the door. Finally, Carol hears muffled throat clearing on the other side of the door. As we hear him unlock the door, Carol looks at her breasts and gasps, grasping the fabric and holding it straight out just as Melvin opens the door. His hair is standing on end with static, and he periodically gives it self-conscious pats. She pauses, beginning an extraordinarily long silence. Melvin’s reaction is an intense inner struggle not to scream or cry as he turns halfway from her, answering hoarsely. Carol is amused and surprised as two digital clocks on Melvin's nightstand tell us the time. He gets up, taps one foot on the floor twice and then the other foot twice more. He knocks on Simon's door, which opens quickly, and Simon walks painfully back to a chair. He rises and makes an awkward exit, leaving Simon puzzled and concerned. Carol is seated, working on a letter, trying to express her gratitude, with an enormous sheaf of completed pages sitting next to her.",
    "226": "Romantic music tinnily plays as Delmar and Everett watch, with Everett slumped down and angrily hissing, in a dark and quiet theater where they, along with the rest of the sparse audience, look restively about. A man carrying a shotgun enters the auditorium, walks halfway down the aisle, and stops several rows behind Delmar and Everett, scanning the theater before bringing a whistle to his lips. At his whistle, the back doors burst open, and a line of chained men trot in at double-time, filing into one row and then, when filled, the row behind it, remaining silently on their feet. The first guard and two others who escorted in the convicts scan the theater before the first guard blows his whistle again, causing the two rows of chained men to sit. One more whistle cues the movie to grind back up to speed. A hissing whisper from behind draws Everett and Delmar's attention, causing Everett, with jaw hanging open, to stare as if at a ghost, while Delmar also stares but finally acknowledges Pete's corporeal reality. Pete squints and cocks his head as if to ask, \"What was that?\" Delmar repeats the whisper slowly and with exaggerated mouth movements, but Pete shakes his head, indicating he didn't catch it, and repeats, also overarticulating. Meanwhile, Pappy O'Daniel sits on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion, smoking a cigar and sipping bourbon as the evening sun sets; he reacts quizzically to a whispered conversation, looking sadly from one person to another, like a spectator at a dull tennis match. A moment later, Everett rises over the lip of his bed, his face blackened and swaying as if on a boat, raising a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering tool, which he locks onto Pete's chain and levers free. As Pete's hand chinks free, he doesn't react to his newfound liberty, instead burning his eyes into Everett's while shaking his head miserably and weeping. Pete hugs a stunned Delmar and then Everett, who looks profoundly uncomfortable. Now, stunned, Pete and Delmar stare at Everett, with Delmar brightening and Pete suddenly lunging at Everett. Pete tackles Everett, and with his hands wrapped around Everett's throat, the two roll through some brush into a clearing where they abruptly stop. Their view reveals a great open field where men in bedsheets parade in formation before a huge fiery cross. Pete, Everett, and Delmar hastily crabwalk back into the bushes before pushing through together.",
    "1054": "Mr. Gardiner smiles over at Mr. Darcy while Georgiana stands at Lizzie's side, looking down at her. They both look over at Mr. Darcy, and then Lizzie gets up and sets the music out for Georgiana before making her way across the room, only to be stopped by Miss Bingley. Mr. Darcy sits up, and embarrassed, Lizzie hurries back over to Georgiana. Slowly, Lizzie raises her eyes to meet Mr. Darcy's, who sits across the room, watching her with an enraptured expression. The two gaze at each other, their eyes filled with warmth and understanding. Later, as dusk falls, a carriage pulls away from Pemberley, waved off by Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and Georgiana. Mr. Bingley and Georgiana head inside together, arm in arm, but Mr. Darcy remains on the doorstep, watching the carriage clatter down the long, curving driveway. Moments later, he and Mr. Bingley stride back into the drawing room, where Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley are waiting, and he gives Miss Bingley a piercing stare, causing her to look away. Mr. Darcy then walks through the magnificent portrait-lined hall at Pemberley, holding aloft a candle to light his way, with two dogs trotting at his heels. He enters the now-darkened drawing room and places the candle on a mantelpiece, pausing for a moment, leaning against the fireplace as if lost in thought, before looking over at the piano Lizzie was playing earlier and softening his expression as he remembers her lifting her eyes to meet his in a moment frozen in time. The next day dawns grey and misty over Pemberley as Darcy stands in front of his mirror, getting dressed, while his butler brings him his frock coat, which he takes and pulls on. Dressed immaculately in a bottle-green frock coat, cream breeches, riding boots, and a top hat, he gallops through the grounds on his white horse, giving it a faint tap with a whip to speed up the grassy hill. At Lambton, the maid finds Lizzie and the Gardiners, prompting Mr. Gardiner to open the door, and they head out, leaving Lizzie alone with her letters. She settles down to open the first one, while elsewhere a messenger dismounts from his horse and hands Mr. Bennet, in his night things, a letter, which he opens after passing his candle to the housekeeper. Lizzie's eyes fill with tears as Wickham turns to look at Lydia. Lizzie hurriedly opens the next letter, then puts down the letters and hurries to the door as Mr. Darcy strides in. The maid appears, and Mr. Darcy sits down, taking Lizzie's hand, as Lizzie breaks down in tears.",
    "661": "Spider-Man steps back as two more webs pull a wall down on top of him. From beneath the pile of rubble, a hand appears, followed by the Goblin's head and torso, as he hauls himself unsteadily to his feet. Then Spider-Man swoops down, dragging the villain through a trellis and smashing him against another wall. Now it's Spider-Man's turn to rain blades on his opponent, causing the Green Goblin to fall to the ground. The Green Goblin removes the hard mask with a jutting jaw, revealing Norman Osborn, and Peter, Spider-Man, stares in disbelief. The Goblin sneers as he has pressed the remote on his glove, triggering the glider with blades drawn to target Spider-Man. Spider-Man does a backward flip over it, and it heads for Norman, piercing through him and pinning him to the wall. Norman leans on the glider, then looks up at Peter, whose face is clearly visible through the torn mask, before slumping over the glider with his eyes staring wide. On the ground beside him lies the mask of the Green Goblin. Peter lowers his head and later, in the dark, lays Norman, no longer in costume, down on the sofa in the Osborn mansion study. As he does so, Harry, dressed in black, walks into the room and sees his father and the shadowy figure of Spider-Man. Harry scrabbles in the desk and finds a gun, but when he looks up, Spider-Man has gone, and the net curtains billow in the wind with the window open. On the day of Norman's funeral, after the interment, Harry is standing alone when Peter, hands in pockets, walks slowly over to his friend. Harry turns and nods acknowledgement, and Peter stares, transfixed at Harry. Peter steps forward and puts one arm, then the other around Harry, as the two friends hug. They part, and Harry turns away solemnly, with Peter watching him trudge down the path through the gravestones towards the waiting Rolls-Royce on the road. The bare trees have cast their autumnal leaves as Peter turns to see MJ and Aunt May, standing in front of his uncle's gravestone. MJ comes to join him, and hugs him as they wrap around one another. MJ breaks away, and they stand facing each other as she strokes his cheek with her gloved hand, and he stares intently at her. Standing in the middle of the graveyard with tears in her windblown face, MJ pulls his head towards her and their lips meet in a long and passionate embrace. The lingering kiss stops, and they study each other's faces as tears well in MJ's eyes. When she closes her lids, the tears roll down her cheeks, and Peter sadly turns from her and slowly walks away. MJ stands by the gravestone, sobbing, then suddenly, as if struck by a memory, she moves her hand up to her lips.",
    "513": "Lee glances over her shoulder, then turns from the doorway and walks away. The camera follows her, moving across a book-and-photograph-filled bookshelf that obscures her from view as she walks into a crowded, comfortable vestibule. People, some holding drinks, some just entering the apartment, surround her. Everyone is talking at once, carrying on easy, familiar conversation. Lee smiles at the various people, exchanging greetings. Lee walks into the living room, turning her head back for a moment to talk to the child she has just hugged. The camera is still moving with Lee as she smiles and stops to chat with her mother. Lee starts to walk off again, finishing her conversation with her mother. She passes several other guests, then turns to greet April, giving her a warm, brief hug. Elliot's voice-over continues as he is actually seen, standing in a doorway having a conversation with a gesturing, rotund man. Both are holding drinks as Lee, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, walks between them. The space is very tight; the men hold up their drinks to make room for her. Elliot watches Lee walk off; the other man, oblivious, continues to talk. Elliot reluctantly returns to the conversation, but he can't help turning his head to gaze at the offscreen Lee as the other man chatters on. The camera resumes following a smiling Lee. She has just put down the tray and drinks near April, and briskly and obliviously, she walks past a doorway where Elliot, still ruminating, watches her, entranced. The camera stays with Elliot, who is still watching the offscreen Lee. In the background, guests continue to chatter warmly with each other. Hannah, carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres, walks up behind the distracted Elliot. Elliot, taking one of the hors d'oeuvres, starts nibbling as well as he and Hannah walk past the bookshelf into the living room. Elliot and Hannah, eating and talking, walk past a hallway and offscreen as Holly appears, walking down the hallway. She holds a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres; she stands at the entrance to the hallway, eating and looking at the offscreen guests. Holly, standing in the hallway onscreen, swallows loudly. Holly takes a sip of her drink as Hannah and Elliot walk over to her. Holly and Hannah begin to laugh. Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past a memo-cluttered refrigerator to the stove as Holly, behind her, begins to speak. As Holly talks, sipping her drink, Hannah busily works in the kitchen, which contains a large center table stacked with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and general party clutter. She walks on-and-offscreen as she talks and listens to her sister.",
    "257": "He is pulling into a convenience store parking lot and puts the car in park but leaves it running. As he gets out of the car, a hand enters to take a package of panty hose from the standing rack, and another hand takes a big carton of disposable diapers from the shelf. A pimply-faced lad with a paper 7-Eleven cap on his head is looking up from a dirty magazine, reacting in horror to something approaching. Hi is approaching the check-out island with a gun in one hand and the carton of Huggies tucked under the other. The L'Eggs stocking is pulled over his head to distort his features as he presses a silent alarm under the lip of the counter. Ed is reading to Nathan Jr. from a large picture book but pauses for a moment, listening, as they can barely hear a distant siren. She resumes absently, but her voice trails off as the WHOO-WHOO of the siren is definitely approaching. Ed hooks an arm around the seat and looks behind the car, then looks forward. Indistinctly visible through the semi-reflective glass are two figures at the check-out island, one pointing something at the other as the siren grows louder. Under her breath, she unstraps herself and gets out of the car. In a two-shot of Hi and the Cashier, the cashier is stuffing bills into a grocery bag, and beyond them Ed can be seen outside, circling the front of the car. Her shout is muffled through the glass, and with this Hi notices her. He turns to the Cashier, but Ed is already getting into the driver's seat of the car. As she slams the car door shut, the siren is quite loud now, and the car squeals out of the lot. The squad car tops a rise to bounce into view, its siren wailing. Hi bursts out the door, still wearing the stocking, and the carton of Huggies is still tucked under one arm as he bellows hopefully after his departing car. Hi looks around the parking lot, bewildered, as the wailing siren becomes painfully loud. Hi looks behind him at the plate-glass front of the store, where a bullet pock mars the glass. Through the glass, the pimply young Cashier with the paper 7-Eleven cap pops up from behind the counter to sight down his huge .44 Magnum for another shot, the gun so big he uses both hands to heft it. SMACK-CRACK - the bullet kisses another hole in the glass. Hi is off and running as the squad car is screeching into the lot. An officer tumbles out of the passenger side before the car is fully stopped, rolls on the pavement, then hurriedly rights himself and takes up a half-kneeling shooting stance.",
    "1259": "Carl walks up to Allison, who's wearing a dark blue coat with red piping, and picks her up around her waist with one arm, carrying her to a check-in desk where a woman looks at a computer screen. Carl frowns, perplexed, as they proceed to walk through the small Lincoln, Nebraska airport. At the Telephone Pioneer Museum, they see a mock-up of an early telephone switchboard and a mannequin holding a modern mobile phone while Carl holds up the massive vintage phone. At a shooting range, Allison shoots the ground, an instructor raises the gun barrel, and she hits the clay, making everyone duck as she swings round with the gun. A uniformed band plays at the packed Nebraska Cornhuskers Memorial Stadium where a mascot jumps up and down, and the football team, Big Red, runs onto the field in red-and-white stripes. In Carl's apartment, Peter, Lucy, Rooney, and Lee watch the game on TV as Carl, wearing giant yellow corncobs on his head and arms, jumps up and down in the crowd while Allison wears a massive red Stetson. At a slaughterhouse, Carl faints. In the country, Carl and Allison walk along a track beneath a brooding, gray sky, and he takes off his jacket to wrap it around Allison's head, marches her to a barn, removes the jacket, and she shakes her head, smiling contentedly as they wrap their arms around each other, and Carl, looking thoughtful, rests his chin on her hair. At the airport check-in desk, Carl and Allison stand facing a uniformed woman who checks a computer screen and smiles at them while two serious-looking, suited men walk over and show ID. Carl points at Allison and starts to smile just before they are in an interrogation room where thick-set Tweed narrows his eyes. Allison looks at Carl, disappointed, as they sit handcuffed, and Peter, Tweed, and Multack leave the room. Carl smiles weakly and stares at her wretchedly until Multack walks in to unlock Allison's handcuffs. Allison gets up and, without looking at him, leaves the room as a jet touches down in LA. Allison marches through the busy terminal building with Carl and Peter walking some way behind her. Carl retreats while Allison gets in a yellow cab and Peter watches Carl run back through the terminal building. Later, Carl watches a film and calls Allison, but in a meeting, he sits staring at the table. Meanwhile, on the terrace outside her apartment, Allison stands at an easel, painting. She checks her phone, sees it's Carl calling, and puts it back on the table. Carl takes a flying lesson but looks uninterested. Eventually, Carl stands on the edge of a bridge with a harness around his waist and ankles attached to a bungee rope.",
    "41": "DYLE shrugs. She offers him her cone, thrusting it forward with enough force to dislodge the ice-cream, and it lands right next to his lapel, over his outside breast pocket, including the Cathedral of NOTRE DAME in the background as REGGIE and DYLE step from the elevator. He goes into his room and she goes into hers. She enters, fixes her hair in the mirror, then goes to the door connecting her room with DYLE's. She unlocks it, tries to open it, but finds it locked. Disappointed, she knocks. He calls to her through the closed door as he empties his pockets. He sits down to take off his shoes but is interrupted by the sound of REGGIE screaming. He races for the connecting door, pulls back the bolt and rushes in. As DYLE enters, he wheels as the door is slammed and REGGIE, who had been standing behind it, locks it and pockets the key. He goes to the door leading to the hall and finds that locked as well. She smiles at him. DYLE looks at her, then sits down and starts to remove his shoes. Testing the water with his hand, he now steps in fully dressed. REGGIE can't believe her eyes. She goes to the open door for a closer look as he takes out his handkerchief and rinses it. He opens his coat and reads a label inside. He flicks a little water in her face, then takes the nail-brush and scrubs his watch and watch-band. He holds up his wrist so she can see the watch. He begins unbuttoning his suit. She turns and leaves, slamming the door after her. The PHONE rings and she answers it. CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE on the phone, looking like the rug has been pulled out from under her. REGGIE slowly lowers the phone to its cradle, a worried expression on her face. Then the bathroom door opens and DYLE appears dressed in a large bath towel. She shakes her head. The large motor launch, moving along the river, gaily ablaze with lights. At a table for two by the rail, the city slowly passing in the b.g. They walk back to the table, where a WAITER is busy putting food on it, mostly on REGGIE's side. REGGIE reacts in surprise. She looks at him with happy amazement, then pushes her plate away. The lights go out. A searchlight near the boat's bridge has gone on and now begins sweeping the river banks. On benches by the water's edge, lovers are surprised by the bright light which suddenly and without warning discovers them in various attitudes of mutual affection. Some are embarrassed, some are amused and some (the most intimate) damn annoyed.",
    "528": "A couple stands by the window; one man gets up from his chair and walks away. Some guests sip their drinks, smiling, as the camera moves back to the piano and the book-laden wall. Evan is playing the piano with exuberance while Norma, still standing behind him, has a poignant, wistful expression on her face. Mavis the maid walks by with a tray of hors d'oeuvres, and the man takes one, mouthing his thanks, as the camera travels past the open bookshelf, past two boys in suits who are drinking soda and munching, to reveal Lee. She is leaning against another doorway, a faraway look on her face as she listens to the music. Mavis passes in the hall beyond the doorway. Several people, deep in conversation, stand nearby as Elliot, holding a drink, walks up behind her. Lee slips past Elliot and walks away. Elliot looks back at her briefly, then, sipping his drink, he turns and looks offscreen at the crowd in the living room. Holly is standing in the pantry, preparing some offscreen food when Hannah walks into view, headed for the refrigerator, carrying two tomatoes. Hannah opens the refrigerator, totally ignoring Holly, then walks over to the table, gathering up more food. Holly walks over to the sink and washes her hands, drying them as Hannah, her arms laden with vegetables, strides over to her sister. Hannah storms out a nearby door as Holly turns away from the sink. Holly wipes her hand on the towel as Hannah reenters the kitchen, carrying even more vegetables, and strides into the pantry area, flopping the vegetables down on the counter. Holly puts the dishtowel down and absently straightens some things on the food-laden table. Hannah angrily gathers up some spices from the table; Holly walks back onscreen holding a silver ice bucket, stops at the corner of the table, and faces Hannah. Hannah picks up a large bowl and carries it, along with her armload of spices, into the pantry area. Hannah, reacting, puts the spices down on the pantry counter while Holly turns away. Guests can be seen mingling and talking and helping themselves at a buffet table in the living room. Lee and Elliot can be heard offscreen as the camera slowly moves from the doorway across the empty dining room to reveal them in the midst of an intense conversation. Lee goes over to an open door and closes it quickly. The door opens and Mavis appears, holding a set of candlesticks. She walks over to the dining room table, which is already decked out with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china, and puts them down as Lee and Elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.",
    "640": "Bo points at it, and Graham falters, opening the book. Graham looks uncertain, nodding dubiously as he takes the book from Morgan and starts to leaf through the pages, while Morgan and Bo look on. On one page is a simple sketch of an extraterrestrial with a teardrop-shaped head and large catlike eyes. On another page is a picture of a bluey-green alien with an angular jaw and black almond-shaped eyes. On a third page, a gloomy nighttime drawing depicts a UFO firing two red laser beams into a wooden farmhouse, which is on fire, with flames pouring from the upstairs windows. Lying on the lawn of the pictured house are three shadowy bodies, an adult and two children. Morgan and Bo are staring at the picture as Graham's eyes flick pensively from side to side, and they all jump back. Taking the book, he leaves and answers the phone on the landing. Graham stands stock still with the telephone receiver still pressed to his ear and glances down the landing into a room containing a dressmaker's dummy. Now clothed, Graham plods downstairs, takes a coat from the closet where Merrill is still glued to the TV, and then picks up some keys. Merrill looks confused. From the bedroom, Morgan is looking at clouds through a telescope as Bo stands beside him. Bo nods with a worried expression, gives a slow deliberate nod, hugs his arm, and avoids eye contact. Graham knocks at the house of Vet Ray Reddy. He opens the screen door, peers through slats in the wooden door behind it, then gingerly closes the screen as Graham gently releases the handle. Stepping back from the door, his keen eye scans from left to right. He turns and treads calmly along the wooden veranda surrounding the house. Reaching the closed window, he stops and looks through the glass into an office, where the compact ruin is deserted, and the solid dark wood desk is clattered with papers. Graham's gaze alights on a wooden chair lying upturned on the floor beside the lampshade, with its toppled vase on a small round table above and the naked bulb still glowing brightly, viewing the scene with restrained alarm. Then, backing away, he turns and spots the brown Chevy 4x4 parked on a short driveway with a figure at the wheel. Graham approaches the vehicle cautiously across a lawn, leaning over to get a view of its occupant. The passenger side window is lowered as Graham puts both hands on the sill and leans in with an inquisitive frown. Ray, the Asian man who stayed in town, sits with one hand clamped to the steering wheel, rocking nervously and staring numbly ahead. In the back are bundles of clothes which Graham eyes questioningly. Returning his attention to the front, he notices a blood stain on Ray's check shirt.",
    "1127": "Hermione crouches down and, taking out her wand, draws a circle in the air, producing a wreath of white roses. Harry wipes his nose with his sleeve and gazes at the grave. Comforting him, Hermione rests her head on his shoulder, then she turns and spots a dark figure watching them from a short distance away. Harry sees an old woman wearing a knitted cape with a hood, who turns and totters slowly away. They follow her up the street until Harry slows and stops beside a burned-out, roofless house. He looks over the gate at the overgrown garden and recalls Voldemort's attack, with both bodies lying on the floor, setting Harry's joy. They turn to find the old woman close beside them, and Harry approaches her as she stares at him. Inside a dark house, Harry takes a matchbox from Bathilda, lights a candle, and the wizened old woman studies Harry's face. He captures sight of something over her shoulder as Bathilda turns her attention to Hermione. Harry holds up the match beside a framed photograph of the young thief who stole Gregorovitch's Elder Wand. Bathilda gazes at him, then picks up the candle and eases her way past him. Hermione looks anxious as Harry follows Bathilda, leaving Hermione in the filthy living room. The tip of his wand lights up, illuminating his way up the stairs, while in the living room, the tip of Hermione's wand is also glowing. She picks up a book with a note attached to the cover, lifts the note to read the title, and turns the book over to reveal a moving picture of a smirking Rita. Upstairs, Harry reaches a dingy bedroom where the old woman is waiting for him, and he sees her looking at the locket around his neck. She indicates something across the room as downstairs, Hermione walks into another dark room, her wand as the only source of light, and disturbs a swarm of buzzing flies. Upstairs, Harry examines a photograph album on a dressing table as the old woman's face contorts, becoming cadaverous, and she disintegrates when Harry spins around. Downstairs, Hermione spots blood on the ceiling as the snake lunges. Harry fends it off with a chair, while downstairs, Hermione trips and falls. The snake hurls itself at Harry, smashing him through a brick wall into a child's bedroom, causing the light on the ceiling to sway. The snake wraps itself around Harry, who picks up a brick from the rubble and smashes the snake's head with it, causing it to slither off him. Harry hauls himself back through the wall as Hermione comes up the stairs, and the snake attacks again. Hermione flourishes her wand, hitting the snake and causing it to fall down the stairs. Harry's wand, dropped in the struggle, is lying at the top of the stairs.",
    "943": "Holmes pulls him away and whacks him with a curtain rail. As they fight, the Corsac attaches a line to Holmes' belt. Sim kicks the Corsac out of the window. The line between him and Holmes is pulled tight, dragging Holmes towards the window. Holmes is wrenched backwards, out of the window. He lands heavily on a barge carrying sand on the canal outside. The Corsac bursts up out of the sand and grabs him. Holmes breaks free and falls onto a lower deck. The Corsac tries to flee, but Holmes yanks him back with the rope connecting them. Men grab them both. The men release Holmes and the Corsac. Holmes grabs a club off one of the men watching and whacks the Corsac in the face. Then he yanks on the rope, pulling the Corsac over. The Corsac gets up again and cuts the rope linking them together. The Corsac starts to climb back up the window they fell from. Sim sees him coming and backs away from the window. One of the spectators urges Holmes on. Holmes shins up a rope hanging from a block-and-tackle on the side of the building. The Corsac gets back inside. Watson collects his winnings from the other players. Holmes smashes through a window and crashes into Watson, scattering all the money. Holmes sits up and sees the Corsac bounding along the second floor balcony above Sim, who runs along the first. The Corsac leaps down onto her floor. Holmes picks himself up and gives chase. Watson notices the other players eyeing his winnings, which are now scattered on the floor. A free-for-all erupts as everyone lunges for the cash. As Watson struggles with the other gamblers, Mycroft leaves the men he was chatting to. The Corsac leaps down some steps and trips Sim up. She rolls out of the fall and draws a knife. The Corsac dodges her attack and punches her in the face. He thumps her a second time and is about to strike with his own knife when Holmes intervenes. He kicks the Corsac out of a door and into the canal. Sim gets to her feet, clutching her nose, and turns to Holmes. Dr. Watson arrives, a bit drunk. He falls over. Carruthers looks dubious. Holmes retrieves Sim's bag and Rene's letter. The next day, he drives his car along a narrow road leading to a village. The car pulls up outside the church. Sporting dark glasses and smoking his long pipe, Holmes turns around to a bruised and beaten Watson, who is asleep beside him. He nudges Watson, who stirs but doesn't awake. Holmes gets out of the vehicle, walks round it and shoves Watson again. He still doesn't rouse.",
    "599": "The front door is off its hinges. As they enter the house, Dumbledore holds his wand in his undamaged left hand. The tips of their wands glow like torches. The house is in a mess. Pictures hang at angles. There are scratches on a door frame. Harry and Dumbledore enter the sitting room, where the furniture is toppled over. The room has been completely trashed. As Harry stares down at the paper, a spot of blood drops onto it. Harry looks up. Plaster has broken away, revealing bloodstained rafters. A drop lands on his forehead. Dumbledore wipes the blood off Harry's forehead with a finger, and tastes it with the tip of his tongue. Dumbledore glances suspiciously around the room. He fixes his eyes on an over-stuffed comfy armchair and slowly walks towards it. Harry follows. Dumbledore prods the armchair with his wand. A man in disguise. He spots Harry. Dumbledore sweeps his wand over the room. Bits of broken glass fly towards a shattered chandelier. It re-hangs itself from the ceiling. Harry steps aside, as a vinyl disk returns to a record player. Books fly back onto shelves, and a grand piano rights itself. The missing plaster renews itself on the ceiling, and Harry smiles. He looks down at his feet. Trapped under his trainer is a piece from the chandelier. He raises his foot, and it zooms up to its rightful place. Horace wears pajamas made from upholstery fabric. He grins at Harry. Harry crosses over to a collection of framed, moving photographs. A group of them raise glasses. Dumbledore leaves. Harry glances at Horace Slughorn, then goes out. As they walk down the path, Slughorn comes after them. In the street, Dumbledore holds out his arm. Harry braces himself. Dust rises as they apparate. Alone, Harry lands in a stream. Shaking water from his trainers, he trudges through a reed bed. He smiles when he recognizes the Weasley house. He sees Ginny in an upstairs window. Coming downstairs, Ginny spots Harry's trunk and white owl. On the stairs, Ginny runs to Harry and they hug warmly. As they part, they gaze at each other. Hermione runs up. Ron touches Hermione's cheek. Harry regards Ron and Hermione with interest. Harry, Hermione, and Ron are sitting on the floor, around a tray set on a stool. In a dingy, wet part of town, Draco's mother Narcissa walks along a narrow alley, with Bellatrix Lestrange. They wait for children to cycle past. Then, Narcissa steps out onto a street and knocks at a door. The two women wait outside in the rain. A face peers at them through the glass panel in the door. A round-faced man, Wormtail, lets them into Severus Snape's study.",
    "89": "Jean rushes toward the door, cloaked by the shower curtain but awkwardly trying to push it off; still thrashing, Jean crashes against the upstairs railing, trips on the curtain and falls, thumping crazily down the stairs. Grimsrud follows and trots down after her. Wade sits behind his desk; another man rises as Jerry enters, and Stan Grossman shakes his hand. Wade scowls, looks at Stan, and is angry. We are high and wide on the office building's parking lot. Jerry emerges wrapped in a parka, his arms sticking stiffly out at his sides, his breath vaporizing. He goes to his car, opens its front door, pulls out a red plastic scraper and starts methodically scraping off the thin crust of ice that has developed on his windshield; the scrape-scrape-scrape sound carries in the frigid air. Jerry goes into a frenzy, banging the scraper against the windshield and the hood of his car, but the tantrum passes; scrape-scrape-scrape - he goes back to work on the windshield. The door swings open and Jerry edges in, looking about, holding a sack of groceries. He shuts the door and has already seen the shower curtain on the floor. Jerry stands in wide shot, hands on hips, looking down at a telephone; after a motionless beat he picks up the phone and punches in a number. It is a flannel-shirt woodsman carrying a double-edged axe over one shoulder. As we hear the rumble of an approaching car, the continuing tilt and boom down brings us down the woodsman's body to a pedestal. A sweep of headlights illuminates a sign on the pedestal. The headlights sweep off and a car hums past and on into the background. The two-lane highway is otherwise empty. Carl drives while Jean lies bound and curled on the back seat underneath a tarpaulin, and from the back seat we hear whimpering. Grimsrud smokes and gazes out the window, then turns to look and stares at Carl, then turns back to the window. At a loud WHOOP Carl starts and looks back out the rear window; fifty yards behind a state trooper has turned on his gumballs. Carl looks up at the rear-view mirror and Grimsrud looks at him. Both cars have stopped, and Carl looks into the back seat as the car bounces and slows on the gravel shoulder. The trooper is stopped on the shoulder just behind them, writing in his citation book, as Carl watches and Grimsrud stares at Carl. The trooper walks up the shoulder, one hand resting lightly on top of his holster, his breath steaming in the cold night air. Carl opens his window as the trooper draws up; the trooper scans car interior, taking his time, while Grimsrud smokes and gazes calmly out his window.",
    "216": "At the foot of the cross, Everett snaps its last guy wire with his pincers, and the four men sprint off. As the crowd scatters, the cross descends toward Big Dan, who is frozen, looking up, and it crashes in a shower of sparks and embers that obliterates Big Dan Teague. A car pulls up in front of a town hall from which party sounds filter out, and Pappy O'Daniel emerges from the car with his retinue: Eckard, Spivey, and Junior. Delmar sulks while Everett is stunned. As headlights play, the men suck back into the alley as a car passes by. The car tools up to the banquet hall, and Homer Stokes emerges with his midget, who tosses his balled-up white hood into the car and both men shrug into their suitcoats; they start up the stairs with Stokes's pace brisk and the midget hopping awkwardly to keep up. Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy enter through the back door with the blackface scrubbed off, and all four now wear long gray beards as a disguise, clumsily affixed with spirit gum. Each is carrying a musical-instrument case, and they elbow past the bustling kitchen help. Out in the banquet hall, Penny and Waldrip sit side-by-side at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals, facing the hall with their backs to the stage as Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy take their places. Pappy O'Daniel stands by Waldrip's chair, draping an arm over his shoulder and murmuring confidentially, as Waldrip sits stiffly erect, listening, frowning at a spot in space. Suddenly, Waldrip erupts, and she shakes her head vigorously and looks down at her plate as Everett continues pleading to her back. The band launches into \"Man of Constant Sorrow,\" precipitating a huge reaction. Everett, trying to get Penny's attention, is stunned at the ovation as he and the boys, still singing, exchange bemused looks. They shrug and lean into the song with a will. Everett performs an impromptu buck-and-wing, bringing the crowd to new heights of hysteria. Stokes is staring at the band, frowning, while the crowd stares at him, stone-faced, as he plows on. He is hit by a tomato and pelted by foodstuffs, shielding himself with one arm while bellowing into the mike. An old man in overalls and his wife sit hunched before a crystal set, listening to the tinny voice. They look at each other wordlessly and then look back at the crystal set. Stokes is almost drowned out by the music as his midget looks on apprehensively, and a disgruntled audience member yanks out the microphone plug, leaving Stokes to mouth inaudible words.",
    "445": "Don removes his hat in a courtly bow, very much at ease with the apples, and then passes the ladies who are chatting, while one of them tsk-tsks, and they both look after Don as he sits on a bar stool, putting down the paper bag. He takes the bills and change from his pocket and puts it on the bar as Nat pours the drink and returns to squeezing lemons. Don picks up the glass and is suddenly acutely aware of the people at the table and Nat's eyes, which causes the glass to freeze halfway to his mouth. He puts it down and starts playing the nonchalant, casual drinker -- the man who can take it or leave it -- then takes a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, shakes one out, and lights it. As he puts the match in the ashtray, his eyes fall on that jigger of whiskey, so he puts the handkerchief back in his pocket, lifts the glass, and drains it in one gulp. Nat comes up with the bar towel to wipe off the wet ring left by the glass, while Don holds the empty jigger in his hand. From the table in the background, Gloria heads for the powder room, passing Don and running her finger through the neckline of his hair, then she goes on. Don turns back to Nat, points at the bag with the apples showing, but Nat looks and doesn't get it until Don, like a magician, takes two apples out, revealing the necks of the bottles, prompting Nat to pull one. Nat leans over the bar towards Don as he points to the empty glass for Nat to fill it, and without a change of expression, Nat pours the second drink. Gloria returns from the powder room, and on her way to her gentleman friend at the table, she runs her finger through the neckline of Don's hair. She is almost past him when he catches her hand and pulls her towards him, then Don looks off toward the table, and she returns to the table. The camera focuses on the wet rings the wet glass has left on the bar, and in two quick dissolves, we see the five rings, then six, then nine. He puts the robe with the slippers inside it into the case as Wick slams shut the suitcase and snaps the lock. Wick takes his suitcase and goes into the living room, followed by Helen, setting down the suitcase and taking a topcoat from the closet, while Helen turns away from Wick, leans against the wall, hoping he won't see that she's crying. Don, with an empty jigger in his hand, stands at the same spot, only now leaning with his back against the bar in a place about half filled with eight customers at the bar and five tables occupied.",
    "1129": "He wrestles with the chain as it drags him back, and choking, pressed up against the ice, Harry can't find the opening where he entered the water. He hammers with his hands on the underside of the ice and kicks at it with his bare feet as a shadowy figure walks over the ice above him. Harry's movements slow, and his eyes close as the figure enters the water behind him. A hand grabs the sword, and Harry is hauled across the ice. He's leant against a fallen tree as the figure moves away still clutching the sword. Harry leans forward and grabs his glasses, and he sees Ron. Harry sets the locket on the fallen tree. Drenched, Ron stares awkwardly at Harry, then looks at the ground. Ron prepares himself, and the locket springs open, knocking Harry and Ron to the ground as a huge black cloud swirls over Ron and a swarm of spiders appears. Ghostly images of Harry and Hermione speak to Ron, and he sees naked images of Hermione and Harry kissing passionately. Ron seethes as he watches them, and with the sword in both hands, Ron races towards Harry, who cowers. Ron strikes the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor, and the black cloud and the images disappear. Harry stares at the open locket as Ron is on his knees and lets go of the sword. Harry sits on the ground beside him. Hermione wakes and comes out of the tent as Harry approaches. He indicates Ron and smiles, and Ron grins broadly. Hermione glares, stomps over, and wrenches the rucksack from Ron's shoulder, then turns back to Ron, who holds up the open locket. He glances at Harry, blinks, and looks away. Scruffy and bedraggled, Ron gives Hermione a faint smile, and she faces him with her arms folded and a set expression on her face. In the tent, Ron and Harry are watching a flame in a jar while Hermione sits outside. He gazes at the flickering flame, Harry takes it, and the flame flares and dies. She ignores Ron, rushing past him to address Harry and shows him Rita's book as Ron stands shoulder to shoulder with Hermione. He puts up his hand, and she glances at Harry, raising her eyebrows, and walks off, leaving Ron crestfallen as he lowers his hand. A vast expanse of open heath land stretches out with hills in the distance, and Ron trudges ahead of Hermione and Harry. A crooked house stands alone, with plums floating in the air like orange balloons. The top half of the door opens, and Xenophilius peers out as Harry moves towards the door. Inside, they sit in a cluttered room, each holding a mug, and all four raise their mugs and drink in unison. Xenophilius holds up the pendant, and Harry glances blankly at his friends, then back to Luna's father.",
    "148": "He takes the prisoner's stand. He looks around, a little surprised, a little affected by the demonstration. He looks up at the judge. For a minute, their eyes meet; the judge makes a little bow to Gandhi. Gandhi reciprocates, and the judge sits down. Featuring the reporters shrugging incredulously to each other, as they sit once more. The Advocate General is speaking from a folded journal. There is a little shock of reaction around the courtroom. The Advocate General smiles with a brittle disdain, then he turns to the judge. The judge nods. He turns, glancing at the empty table for defense counsel, and then to Gandhi. It is almost a cruel challenge to the obviously humane Broomfield. The reporters scribble, watching the Judge even as they write, because the mere doubt in the Judge's face reflects on the whole position of the British to India. He lowers his glasses soberly, staring at them for a moment. He looks up at Gandhi, and his own respect for him is almost poignantly manifest. A stunned intake of breath from the whole courtroom, then in absolute silence the clerk scribbles the sentence in his notebook. The Judge lowers his eyes. He folds, and refolds his glasses and then without looking at anyone, he rises. The court rises, and he walks stiffly to his chambers. He stands, staring at Broomfield, and now it is his face that shows the respect. From far above the hills, we see a car traveling along the road. Its style tells us some years have passed. The reporter from the New York Times, whom we first saw as a younger man in South Africa. He is in an open car, turning back to look at something, his face intrigued by what he sees. We see from Walker's point of view an Indian woman walking along the road, leading a tall camel that carries sacks of produce. Two young girls in ragged saris walk with her, and a boy of eight leads a smaller camel behind them. They are staring off at the car. The car is an early 1930s Morris Minor. Collins glances at him in surprise as he steers the car around another procession of camels heading toward the port. He is looking straight ahead. Across the emptiness of the temple, Ba faces him. Another angle featuring Walker and Collins, who are sitting alone, in the cool shadows of the temple, watching with fascination as Gandhi and Ba repeat their marriage ceremony for them, Walker jotting notes occasionally, but his eyes always glued to Gandhi and Ba, who are in part lost in memories and echoes of a significance only they can know. Showing the two of them before the altar of the temple, moving closer to each other.",
    "750": "Minnie sits down on the chair Celia has set out for her with a sigh, as Celia gently dabs the cut above Minnie's eye with a cloth. Minnie listens mutely to Celia's suggestion. At the Phelans', everyone is listening to Walter Cronkite on the black and white TV. Stuart kisses Skeeter on the forehead, and they're both wearing black. She turns her teary eyes back to the TV, where a color photograph of John F. Kennedy hangs next to a photograph of Aibileen's son. Minnie's eyes shift, and she flashes back to her visit to Hilly's. Hilly, sitting at a polished mahogany dining table, takes a bite of Minnie's pie and luxuriates in its deliciousness as Minnie watches her with a look of a satisfied bullfrog. Hilly takes another forkful, and Mrs. Walters stomps in with an empty glass and pours a whiskey. Hilly shoves the plate at Minnie, waves her away, and takes another forkful. Minnie slams down the plate as the last forkful enters Hilly's mouth. Hilly rises to her feet, and Minnie fixes her with a look of barely-disguised amusement, while Minnie's round black eyes indicate the pie. Mrs. Walters dissolves into giggles, and Minnie raises her eyes from the chocolate-colored pie to fix them on Hilly, who retches. Minnie picks up the remaining pie and flees as Skeeter shakes her head, and Minnie, wrapping her cardigan around her, storms out. A white-only Jackson City cab brings Mrs. Walters to the Junior League benefit dinner, where she joins the other elegantly-dressed guests climbing the steps towards the fairy-lit venue. The Footes arrive arm in arm, grabbing a glass of champagne from a mate's tray. Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen are on duty in black uniforms with white collars and full white aprons, while Minnie nudges Aibileen to look at Celia's body-hugging pink dress. Polishing off her glass, Celia waves at Hilly, whose automatic smile freezes as she slaps her husband's cheek for looking. Charlotte and her husband are among the guests taking to the black and white checkered dance floor, next to Skeeter and Stuart who are dancing cheek to cheek. Celia, standing by the buffet table with another glass of bubbles, writes something down. Mr. Blackly performs a jig followed by a cartwheel on the dance floor, causing the maids to double up with laughter. Celia wanders unsteadily into the powder room, where Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth stand in a hostile line in front of the mantle piece. Celia leans forward to reapply her lipstick, turning her perfectly formed behind in their direction. In the ballroom, Hilly is at the mic and holds out her hand towards the dozen or more staff standing in a line. Skeeter's face tightens.",
    "1073": "The boy watches from long grass. He gives a smile as dry as the flat plains which stretch out to the hills on the horizon, and accompanies Sarah down the hill, away from the cemetery. The sun sets on the darkening plains and hills. Darkness settles on the house and buildings of Faraway Downs. The lights go out. Sarah is asleep in bed, moonlight filtering through the curtains. Fletcher looks out at the night, and urges an Aboriginal lady indoors. As King George chants by a fire, Sarah sits bolt upright in bed and lights a lamp. Something moves beneath the steps she's standing on, and King George dances by his hilltop fire. She hurries indoors to find the boy in her bedroom. As he strikes a pose, the curtains billowed. He grins broadly. Sarah's intrigued. A shadow falls over the porch. Fletcher peers in through the shutters, but seeing nothing and leaves. Sarah stands up and looks around the room. She goes to the window, accompanied by Nullah, and peers out. She turns with a start. The curtain is billowing. Clothes hang on a line in the morning sun. Fletcher emerges from his cabin. Nullah's mother hovers in the doorway. He looks around the homestead and scratches his head. She follows him out. Wearing an orange dress, she looks at Fletcher, then walks away from him and the cabin. He idly tosses a stone and watches her go. The sun rises in the clear blue sky. Sarah walks out onto the veranda of the main house. Nullah follows her. He scampers off, as two riders approach. Nullah, hiding behind the gate, opens it. Nullah walks slowly to him. She smiles and nods nervously. Nullah pulls away from the Chinese cook. He's climbed up and removed a chain holding the blades in place. The windmill swings around and starts to turn. They all stare as rusty water is pumped from a pipe. Fletcher chases after the boy. Nullah leaps over the fence before being grabbed by the man. He holds the boy's mother aside and hits him again as Sarah strides up. She cracks him across the face with a riding crop. She points a finger with steely determination. He reaches his truck, then looks around. Flynn tilts his head stubbornly. He backs up as Flynn joins Sarah. He drives off into the dusty distance. His Drovers abandon the cattle and ride off with him. Sing Song watches without emotion. Nullah, his mother, and her friend comfort each other and also join Sarah. She looks at Flynn, who respectfully removes his hat. She looks at her little entourage, and turns and sheds her eyes from the sun. Sarah sits at her messy desk.",
    "593": "Slughorn sits on a chair, looking anxious. At last, Ron comes round, sits up, then lies back weakly on the floor. In the infirmary, Ginny and Hermione sit beside Ron's bed as Madam Pomfrey checks his temperature. Harry turns as a group of staff come in, and Lavender rushes in. She sees Hermione at Ron's bedside and leans closer before running out as Hermione takes Ron's hand. McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Snape leave, followed by Ginny turning to Harry and Madame Pomfrey leaving. Hermione catches Harry's eye, and they exchange a smile. Harry is the last to leave the ward. Sitting on Ron's bed, Hermione strengthens her grip on his hand with a sigh of contentment. The shadow of a figure climbing stairs is cast on a wall. Going up the spiral staircase, Harry spots the figure through an archway: it's Draco Malfoy. Harry steps forward, watches him, and then follows. Draco leaves the upper corridor where the birdcage hangs, now with only one bird remaining. Draco stands still and closes his eyes. When Harry rounds the corner, Draco has disappeared. In the cluttered room, Draco holds the heavy cloth from the cabinet, holding the missing bird. He closes the bird inside the cabinet, picks a single feather off his cuff, and holds it up to the light. Draco opens the cabinet: the bird has gone. Rain pours down on the Borgin and Burke shop sign. Through the dusty arched window at the rear of the shop, a dim light reveals the triangular cabinet, its door firmly closed. Draco nervously opens his cabinet door, looks inside, and finds the bird dead. Draco stares at its lifeless body and frowns, then sobs. Lavender sits in the Great Hall glaring at Ron. Clenching his wand, he sits beside Hermione, as snowflakes start to fall. Ron looks puzzled. Ron, Hermione, and Harry look across at Lavender, who lifts her chin and grits her teeth. Harry's eyes flit from Ron to Hermione and back again, while Hermione looks down. Harry reads a note scrawled in his advanced potion book, jumps to his feet, picks up his book, then marches up the hall to Katie. She looks over his shoulder and stares. Harry turns and sees Draco watching them. Draco backs away, turns, and Harry's out. Katie walks away with her friend as Harry marches down the Great Hall. Draco makes his way upstairs. Harry pushes his way through a group of students as Draco strides along the upstairs corridor where the birdcage is now empty. Harry isn't far behind. Loosening his tie, Draco rushes into the boy’s lavatories, leans over a basin, then pulls off his sweater. Turning on a tap, he studies his distraught face in a mirror.",
    "532": "She is flipping through a book by a curtained window. Lee puts the book she's been holding down on the desk, only to pick up another one. She looks at the offscreen Elliot and reacts. The camera moves to a blushing Elliot, following him now as he walks across the room. As Lee speaks, Elliot parts a hanging curtain against the wall to reveal a stereo and some records. He looks at the offscreen Lee. As Elliot reaches inside the stereo shelf, grabbing a bottle of antihistamines, the camera moves back to Lee, who sits down on the bed. She is still holding a book. Elliot walks over to Lee; he sits down on a footstool in front of her. She chuckles; Elliot smiles and chuckles with her. Hannah, eating a carrot stick, enters the bedroom. The camera stays with her momentarily as she walks towards Elliot and Lee. Holly laughs, and Lee glances over to her, reacting. Hannah, embarrassed, reacts and sits with her hands on her face. They look at Evan, listening. Hannah, embarrassed, makes a victory sign. Lee and Holly try to suppress their laughter. Norma glares at them. Elliot wraps his arm around Hannah; he pulls her towards him affectionately and kisses her on the cheek. She hugs him back. Mavis the maid exits, carrying some trays, as the group starts to cheer and applaud. Holly waves her napkin at April, then holds up her wine glass. The group continues to cheer as they all toast Hannah. She reacts, smiling but embarrassed. The guests, sipping their wine, quiet down as Norma continues to speak. Lee and Holly unsuccessfully try to contain their laughter. Mavis reenters the dining room to serve more food to the children. Norma toasts her daughter; everyone follows her. The applause and cheers begin anew. Hannah, reacting, chuckles. Hannah tenderly takes Elliot's hand as she looks around the table. He, in turn, kneads her shoulder, chuckling with equal tenderness. Hannah, still embarrassed, looks down at a plate. The group applauds once more, toasting and drinking, and warmly sounding their approval. Classical string music plays as the film cuts to a taxi moving down Broadway towards the camera, passing a truck on the right, the Winter Garden marquee advertising Cats, and several buildings, and as the taxi moves offscreen, the classical music still playing, the movie cuts to the taxi's backseat. Lee sits by the window, leaning her head in her hand, a reflective look on her face. Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter of the loft's modern kitchen area; a nearby vase holds flowers. She walks across the loft, with its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee. Lee continues to walk, past a modern chaise, a bookcase, some sofas, and two columns.",
    "488": "Norman stands watching him drive away as the car pulls up and Arbogast gets out, leaving the motor running. As he starts to walk across the highway, the camera pulls away, and Arbogast reaches the phone booth and enters. The camera starts forward, and we see Arbogast remove a small notebook from his pocket, check a number, drop a dime in the slot, and dial. He hangs up and gets out of the phone booth. A distant view shows the House and Motel, with a light on in the house and also in Norman's office. We see Norman emerge from his office and move along the porch toward the distant cabins, carrying sheets on his arm. He goes into the last cabin and switches the light on. The hood of the white Ford enters the scene and stops, and Arbogast gets out and goes over to the Motel office. Arbogast enters, looks around the empty office, and calls out. He goes over to the door to the parlor, enters, looks around the bird-ridden room, goes over to it, finds it unlocked, and with a quick, cautious look around, he opens it, straightens up, and goes out. He goes off and dashes up the stone steps to the House. The camera holds as Arbogast goes up onto the porch. The house is dark within except for a faint spill of light in the foyer, coming from the upstairs hall. After a careful wait, he crosses to the stairs and starts up slowly and guardedly, placing his foot squarely on each step to test for squeaks or groans before placing his full weight on it. The camera follows, remaining on floor level but traveling along the stairway as Arbogast makes his way up. We see Arbogast coming up the stairs, and then the door of the mother's room opens, carefully and slowly. As Arbogast reaches the landing, the door opens, and the mother steps out, her hand raised high, the blade of an enormous knife flashing. The knife slashes across his cheek and neck, blood spurts, and he stumbles back, staggering down the staircase. He frantically gropes for the balustrade as he goes backward down the stairs, and as he collapses at the bottom, the black head and shoulders of Mrs. Bates plunge into the foreground as the camera moves in to contain the raising and descending murder weapon. Meanwhile, Lila sits close by the phone, looking as if she hasn't moved from it in the last hour, while Sam paces, occasionally stopping at the window, glancing out, and pacing again, creating a thick atmosphere of smoke, tension, and weariness in the small, otherwise cozy room.",
    "523": "The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead. Holly pauses, looking at her sister. They continue to walk. Holly looks at her sister for a beat. A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away. She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table. She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly. Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table. A group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage. The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song. A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her. The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience. The camera has reached the executives in the audience. They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten. A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk. Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head. The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey. The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. The movie cuts to Mickey's face. The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to pour the tea into china cups. Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap. The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment. Mickey's mother stands in front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically. His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen. Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son. Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink. Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to the living room. Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway. He starts to pound it. Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen. He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door.",
    "369": "She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined. While he's drinking, Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom. Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife. In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time. Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking letter. Reading it, his face drops. FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence. With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook. The JUMP LEADER yells. One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line. When his time comes, Edward leaps. Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the plane. A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show. A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same. The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. He can't steer. He's helpless. The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up. The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see. She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING. UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. The two men begin to SCUFFLE. Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony. Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister. Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to look. Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A rifle-toting GUARD looks in. Pretending to be her bitchy sister, the guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. Even Ping is a little affected.",
    "907": "In the outer office, the burly agent downs a paper cup of water and passes Doris, who glares at him as he returns to the interrogation room. The interrogator returns, shuts the door, and eyes Billie. He crosses to her and grabs her chin again, shakes her, and Billie's mouth hangs open. She shudders, and her lips tremble as she finds words. The two agents leave her. On the way through the field office, the interrogator points to Doris, who holds the telephone at her shoulder. He puts on his jacket as the other men gather their things and move out. Doris dials her telephone. The agents run up a stairwell and, standing outside an apartment door, one shoots the top and bottom hinges. They rush in. Daylight filters into a bare room through an open window. The place is empty, and the burly agent stiffens his jaw. Back in the interrogation room, Billie sits with her head down. The two agents barge in, and the burly one grabs a phone book and whacks her with it. She keeps her head down, then looks directly at him. As Purvis enters the field office, Doris approaches him. In the interrogation room, she lowers her head and wipes her mouth. The interrogator glares down at her and tensely wipes his mouth, while Billie looks him in the eye. He sneers and winds up with his fist, but Winstead intercepts his arm and slams him against the wall. Purvis enters, and the other interrogator quickly uncuffs Billie's right arm from the chair. As she holds her wrist, Purvis leans over to her. He stands upright as Billie presses down on the arms of the chair to get up, then stops. Purvis glances at the other interrogator, then lifts Billie from the chair and carries her out. In the hall, the rest of the agents stand aside as he passes with the weakened woman. In the interrogation room, Winstead lowers his arm from the burly agent's throat and leaves. Purvis nods to Doris, who escorts them. In the interrogation room, the burly agent stays put beside the open door, out of the sightline of his peers, who stare in from the hall. In a pool hall, Marty dials a pay phone, and at his home, Nitti answers. A woman sits at a bar, and a door opens across the room. Marty enters and takes a seat next to her. Her weary gaze hangs straight ahead, then she looks directly at Marty. He takes her hand and gazes into her eyes. They pick up their drinks, share another glance, and both sip. At night, a lake reflects city lights. Marty leads Anna to a car. She gets in back and gazes at the unseen driver.",
    "1297": "Graham watches them turn into a store as Merrill steps onto the sidewalk, hands in his pockets, and walks away. Graham turns and calls after him, but Merrill waves over his shoulder and keeps walking. Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy, which is three aisles wide, where Mr. and Mrs. Nathan, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter watching a black and white TV. Morgan steps up to the counter and shrugs, prompting Mrs. Nathan to push her husband aside and point to the far corner. A gum-chewing pharmacist in her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens, glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio, while Graham stares at her. When Tracey speaks, her voice is a bit shaky, and Graham notices her teary eyes. Meanwhile, Merrill is at a narrow Army recruiting center, staring at a poster of a muscular guy in an Army uniform on a beach. Inside the small storefront space is a desk, where a crewcut guy savors the beat of silence before Merrill smiles and the crewcut guy smiles back. The crewcut guy reaches for a stack of brochures, picks the top one, and hands it to Merrill, who looks up from it. The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely as Merrill turns to Lionel, a young man about his age sitting at a folding table, who smirks. Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket, looking like he's not going to say anything, but when he does, the words are soft and worn, as if said a hundred times. Merrill turns and starts walking, making a quick move toward Lionel as he passes him, causing Lionel to flinch and cover his face. Merrill then walks out the door of the army recruiting office. Graham glances at the girl sitting sideways at the counter, and his eyes widen as Morgan turns a knob on the side and hands Graham the monitor in the front seat. Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon, with three doors open, and Graham keeps it out in the air as he closes his door. He looks to Merrill over the roof of the station wagon, hands the monitor over the hood, and Merrill reaches for it. Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them, and Morgan is the first one to move, climbing from the back passenger door to the back bumper and onto the station wagon roof. Morgan then crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so-gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.",
    "37": "Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick comes out, and he stops to address Rick politely. As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled expression. At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab vendor is endeavoring to sell, and Rick walks up behind her. She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away, maintaining a politely formal manner, and walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in stunned disbelief. Ilsa and Laszlo then sit with Ferrari, who gets to his feet and walks away while Ilsa smiles faintly and again. At the bar, Ferrari talks to a waiter as Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar. Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa while there's a moment's pause as this sinks in, and Ilsa's face darkens as Laszlo quietly observes. Ferrari bows to them. Later, a European picks a tourist's pocket, and the tourist laughs. The European dashes off and collides with Carl, who then leaves. As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up, and Rick pours a drink for him. Renault gets up and strolls away. At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their orders, and she indicates with her hand where she wants them. A French officer makes a remark to Yvonne, and they begin to fight, as Strasser eyes him closely and smiles. Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away. Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged German couple, the Leuchtags, and sits down. He produces a glass from a back pocket, and they clink glasses and drink. Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the gambling room, and then she sees Rick and goes to his table. Rick looks at her as Annina shakes her head. He pours himself a drink as Annina appears very disturbed. Rick looks at her closely, stares off into space, and abruptly rises. Laszlo looks around as Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter, then walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. Sam shakes his head as Rick leaves. A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table while Jan sits at the roulette table with only three chips left and seems bewildered. As Rick comes up, the croupier speaks to Jan, and Rick stands behind him. Jan looks at Rick and then at the chips in his hand. Rick and the croupier exchange looks, and the croupier understands what Rick wants him to do and spins the wheel. Jan pauses, then puts the chips on twenty-two. The wheel stops spinning, and Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated, as Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands. Carl continues to watch as the wheel spins and stops, and Jan rises to go to the cashier. A customer complains to Carl, and meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier, then smiles slightly and goes toward the door.",
    "759": "David is sitting alone at the table in a small dimly lit kitchen, staring down at the spoon he’s holding against the rim of a cereal bowl, and nods slightly as he brings the spoon under control. He walks down the hall past an open doorway and starts to go upstairs, where his wife looks up at him from inside the room. He stops and looks down at her; she’s standing in front of an open drawer, drops her eyes momentarily, and looks up again gently. He continues upstairs. David, in a gray jacket, walks past a large sign reading \"Memorial Service for the families of East Rail Train 177.\" In the church, a priest stands in the pulpit, and photos cover a large board by the pulpit. Outside the church, David heads towards his car, stops, looks at the windscreen, walks to it, and takes an envelope from under the windscreen wiper. He turns the envelope over, frowning, flicks open the unsealed flap, and stands looking at the card for some moments before turning and gazing back at the church. In a locker room, David opens one of the chipped green doors, stops in the doorway of an office, and takes off his baseball cap. A gray-haired woman with gold-rimmed glasses sits at a computer, glances at her computer screen, picks up a pen, makes a note, puts down the pen, and returns to her work, ignoring him. David pulls on his baseball cap and goes. A cape-hooded figure stands motionless in an archway silhouetted black against the teeming rain, watching an American football training session. One player suddenly erupts into a sprint, sidestepping opponents without losing speed, captures the ball thrown from behind, and dives over the line, tossing the ball to another player and trotting back again. Protected from the rain by the hood of his cape, David sighs deeply. In the locker room, David towels his head and face, puts his towel away, and glances to his right at an older man in the doorway, then stares at the locker door, and glances at Noel. In a darkened room, a hand reaches out and switches on a bedside lamp, and David, head on a pillow, looks sideways at his son who’s sleeping peacefully, while a clock on the other side of the bed reads a quarter to one. David stands at his wife's closed door, and Audrey frowns and shakes her head. From blackout, a fuzzy grayness takes the shape of a sling holding the arm of a black boy sitting in a strangely hazy living room, with a photo on the wall behind and a corner table with a lamp on it.",
    "144": "He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this. His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on his side. He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them. The top is lifted, whiskey pours. The camera pulls back. We are still in the Council Room, but time has passed. The Indian delegation has gone, and the British are relaxing as a servant pours. And they all laugh. There are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so amused. It is an instruction they all find correct. A roar of approval from a huge crowd. We are featuring two British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness. And we can see its cause. A huge crowd is gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- and their mood is confident, belligerent. As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform. Patel, now for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with them. But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd. It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away. There is applause and noise, but Ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, who is talking with Patel and Nehru. At last he rises, and the noise and applause increase to something like chaos. In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting. Gandhi fiddles with his glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but quite definitely, the crowd stills. We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly. Gandhi holds up one finger. Neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction shows it. Now Gandhi raises a third finger. And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause. Gandhi lets it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture as before. This has sobered the audience somewhat. Now he looks out across them as though seeking something. There is an excited stir; he silences it. As suitcoats, shirts, vests, trousers, are flung into a pile. Featuring the two British soldiers -- later -- on the edge of the crowd, staring off, their faces now brightly lit by darting flames. A huge triangular pile burns before the platform, an excited half-naked crowd swirling in the shadows around it.",
    "57": "Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely puzzled. Gittes sighs. She begins to cry softly. Gittes looks over to Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him. There is a long moment of silence. She nods. He gets out and slams the car door. The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it. Pads around in elegant silk pajamas. He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything. Gittes slowly rises to one elbow. He hangs up, falls back down. Gittes swears, picks it up. Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco. Gittes is at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. He opens it and enters. Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen. Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees Ida Sessions lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag. Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter. Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse. He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar. Gittes enters and turns on the light. Escobar and another plainclothed man stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A third man is now coming down the hall from the bedroom. The assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him.",
    "465": "Then suddenly, Fezzik, as he jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size, reaches for the Man In Black, who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. Fezzik considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding, and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, Fezzik moves right with him. Instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for Fezzik's back, and in a moment he is riding him, with his arms locked across Fezzik's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze, tighter. Fezzik charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it, he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. The power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip on Fezzik's windpipe. Again Fezzik charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. The punishment is terrible, and for a moment, it seems as if he is going to let go of Fezzik's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't; he holds on. Again Fezzik slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished, and Fezzik starts to slowly collapse. There isn't much breath coming. The Man In Black, holding his grip as Fezzik tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In Black increases the pressure. Fezzik tries to crawl, but there is just no air. Fezzik goes to earth and lies still. Fezzik, as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to Fezzik's heart. The Man In Black stands and nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it as he dashes off up along the mountain path. Prince Humperdinck slips his boot into a footprint in the sand. Count Rugen, mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed warriors, also mounted. A great white horse waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is, because as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers. And he gallops off. The Man In Black is cresting the peak of the mountain.",
    "933": "He shows Watson the chess piece. In the auditorium, Moriarty watches the performance, apparently spellbound. Holmes, Watson, and Sim hurry into the street and make their way towards the Hotel de Triomphe. The cake containing the bomb is being delivered to the hotel by the rough-looking man and his identical accomplice. In a meeting room at the hotel, Meinhard is making a speech. Holmes and the others race towards the hotel. Meinhard turns to look at the cake, which explodes. Out in the street, Holmes and the others see a massive fireball erupt from the hotel. In the opera house, Don Giovanni throws himself at the feet of the Commendatore statue. Moriarty watches, transfixed, as demons surround Don Giovanni. Holmes, Watson, and Sim run into the hotel and survey the carnage. The demons close in around Don Giovanni. The statue sinks into the ground. In the hotel, Holmes finds Meinhard's body and looks at a ring on the little finger of the dead man's left hand. Looking around, Holmes spots a bullet hole in a wall. He pulls a small telescope out of his jacket and, through it, sees another bullet hole in a window nearby. Beyond it, in the distance, there's a statue on top of a building. Later, he, Watson, and Sim are up on the building, beneath the statue. Holmes imagines a rifle. Moriarty's agent is the sniper. He wedges it in an ornate carving. Holmes recalls entering the opera house. Moran loads his Martini action rifle and aims it at Meinhard. He takes his shot. Day, the Eiffel Tower. Sim and Watson are sitting at a table outside a cafe at the foot of the tower. Holmes, disguised as an old man, is sitting at a nearby table, listening. Once Moriarty and Moran have gone, he leaps to his feet and dashes off down the back staircase. He pulls off his wig and tosses it to a waiter. Nearly colliding with another waiter, he dons a bellhop's uniform and removes his mustache just in time to intercept Moriarty and Moran in the lobby. Sim takes Watson's hat. She exchanges it for a battered old hat. Holmes eyes the horse uncomfortably. Watson pulls her face. Sim, Watson, and a group of gypsy men ride through the forest. Trailing in their wake comes Holmes, astride a very small pony. The gypsies gallop on through the woods. Holmes bumps along uncomfortably on the pony's saddle. They stop a little way away from a border post. Holmes watches through his telescope as troops stop people crossing. Holmes looks disgruntled at the prospect of more riding. He passes the gypsies as they have a break. The gypsies stare after him as he trots by.",
    "804": "Ferris shoots him. Ferris runs to the house. Ferris enters the house with his gun held out in front. He turns a corner and sees a man holding a detonator with wires attached. Ferris shoots him and runs out. As the house blows up, Ferris is thrown off his feet. The black choppers fly above a winding river, then a forest. Bassam drags Ferris to the four-by-four. Ferris burns his hand as he grabs CDs and cassettes from the fire. Bassam drags him to the four-by-four, throws him in the back, and drives off. Explosions rip through the buildings. Two four-by-fours drive towards Ferris and Bassam. Ferris cocks a rifle. Ferris shoots at the other vehicles as they approach. They collide on a bend and ram into a rock. Bassam drives off along a dirt road. The two choppers fly over the desert. Ferris keeps shooting at the Iraqis as they follow in the four-by-fours. Bassam radios. The choppers fly overhead. An Iraqi in each of the pursuing four-by-fours loads a rocket-propelled grenade into a launcher. Ferris leans out of the window and shoots at them. The RPG grazes a chopper and the chopper destroys one of the four-by-fours. The other four-by-four gains on Ferris and Bassam. The chopper fires a rocket which destroys the second four-by-four and knocks Ferris and Bassam's four-by-four onto its roof. It slides to a stop in the dirt, throwing Ferris about in the back. One of the choppers lands. A soldier runs to Ferris. Ferris is hauled into the chopper. A soldier knocks Ferris out with an injection and the chopper takes off. Ferris lies by the open hatch. His face splattered with blood. Lying in a hospital, Ferris remembers being with Bassam and his family. The Iraqi prisoner being beaten to death. A doctor leans over Ferris, who wakes. In a yard outside, soldiers are playing basketball. Using tweezers, the doctor picks a sharp fragment from an open wound in Ferris' arm. He puts it with many other fragments in a kidney bowl. U.S. Military Base, Qatar, Persian Gulf. Ferris sits outside. Ferris takes a phone from the agent. Ferris frowns and stares intensely. Ferris hangs up and looks down. There's a bandage around his left forearm. He picks at a small bloody wound and digs out a splinter of bone. He holds up the tiny pointed fragment on his fingertip for a moment. Ferris opens a matchbox and drops the fragment into it. Deep in thought, he rubs his hands together. A grand boulevard with palm trees along strips of grass running between the lanes of traffic. Ferris is in a dirty black BMW with a heavy-set guy wearing shades, Skip.",
    "250": "Lance continues his frenzied search as Jody calls to him. As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over things, Jody appears in the doorway, and Lance spins toward her. Lance angrily knocks over a pile of items and leaves the shot, heading for the living room. Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room. Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody, opens it, and begins preparing the needle for injection. Vince rips her blouse open as Jody stumbles back into the room, hanging back from the action. Vince points to Mia's right breast, and Lance glances over and nods. As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody, who runs to the desk, opens the top drawer, and, in her enthusiasm, spills the contents (bills, papers, pens) to the floor. The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle, and Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle with a big fat red magic marker in her hand. Vincent grabs the marker from Jody and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is. Then, once you do, push down on the plunger. Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion, looking down on Mia, who is fading fast. Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this, while Lance, on his knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect. A red dot is on Mia's body, and the needle is raised, ready to strike. Jody's face is alive with anticipation. The needle is in the air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. The needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard as Vincent brings it down, stabbing Mia in the chest. Mia's head is jolted from the impact, and the syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. Mia's eyes pop wide open, and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee. She bolts up in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest screaming. Vincent, Lance, and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, jump back, scared to death. Mia's scream runs out, and she slowly starts taking breaths of air. The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright. Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, speaks in a relatively normal voice and then turns around. Vincent is out of the car, standing on the walkway, with a big distance between the two. Mia smiles, and the two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake, which they do. Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.",
    "407": "His eyes open suddenly. The view pulls back slowly from a close-up of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft. Pulling back from the close-up of Ben reveals a row of passengers staring straight ahead with their headsets on. Ben has not moved. The bed on which he is lying moves as though someone has sat down upon it next to him. As Ben speaks, the door to the bedroom opens, and Mrs. Braddock looks in. They move out of the door, with Mr. Braddock steering Ben. Phil and Mimi Carlson are coming up the stairs as the Braddocks move down. Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink, and Ben tries to smile and return the wink politely. They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs. Ben moves to the front door and opens it. Mr. Loomis steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand. Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall. Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room. Ben moves back to the stairway as three ladies come out of the living room. One lady takes Ben's right hand, another lady his left, and the third fingers the front of his jacket. Mr. McQuire appears behind Ben, and they look at each other for a moment. Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house. The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben. Ben goes into the house through the back door. Through the windows of the house, Ben makes his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs, and to his room. There is the sound of a door slamming. Ben stands with his back against the door. A long shot over Ben shows the pool area and people below. The door opens, and Ben turns to see Mrs. Robinson enter the room. They stand for a moment, looking at each other. Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed. She takes a cigarette from her purse, lights it, blows out the match, and puts it down carefully on the bedspread. Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match, and puts it in the wastebasket. Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson a set of car keys. Mrs. Robinson looks at him, shakes her head, and throws the keys to him. Ben gets out and goes around to her side, opens the door, and they move to the door. She takes out her key and opens the door.",
    "580": "Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment, and then he starts up the stairs. Joe waits guardedly at the bottom as Parrish descends, sensing Parrish's tone, but doesn't answer. Parrish measures Joe, his jaw sets, while Susan seems distracted. Parrish blinks and stares down at his cards, realizing that something in Susan's tone lets him know not a word has sunk in. Quince, meanwhile, sips wine, pouring some red and white into one glass, smiles, nods embarrassedly, and drains his glass. Joe regards Quince, who drains one more glass, then heads out as Parrish and Joe fall silent. Joe is silent too, cogitating, as Parrish begins to reach him. Joe then makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, until he is hit by the lights, laughter, and music of the party, blinking and at a loss. Susan waits, and Joe kisses her, falling into a deep embrace. Joe struggles with a response and eventually drifts into a long silence; Susan, beside herself and her emotions tossed, is steadied by Joe. She smiles wanly as Joe leaves her. Parrish is seated by the window, with party lights flashing past, the music and laughter audible but muted, lost in thought. Joe enters, and Parrish looks up, waiting and regarding him sympathetically. A knock on the door breaks the silence, and Quince appears, flushed with excitement. Parrish weighs the information for a moment; Quince exits, and Parrish presses the speakerphone button. Quince leads the way through the lights and music as Drew makes an imperial entrance, hailing partygoers, with Quince enjoying the irony. Parrish sits at his desk, while Joe stands in a distant corner. Drew enters with Quince, who nods, excuses himself, and closes the door, while Drew takes a seat. Joe can no longer control himself, and Parrish is struck dumb, looking at Joe pleadingly and shaking his head imperceptibly. Joe nods blithely and commandingly; Drew is all attention as Joe steps forward, and Parrish clicks the speakerphone off. Drew stares at Joe, shaking his head, as Parrish hesitates, waves, and steps away to applause and cheers. The music resumes with another dance tune as Quince grabs Parrish, pumps his hand, and claps him on the back. Parrish spots Allison and wraps her in a tight embrace, but they are separated by guests. Finally, Parrish sees Susan, who smiles with a tinge of sadness.",
    "1166": "The student army faces a metal figure dressed as a cloaked Dementor holding a wand, with a target painted on its chest. Harry nods to Neville, whose wand is hurled across the room, and the Dementor's wand falls. Filch lurks behind a pillar, spotting students approaching the room, and reaches the door as it dissolves back into the stone wall. Nigel, a plucky small boy, faces Harry and prepares himself. Harry is thrown backwards. Filch, eating a huge sandwich, guards the blank wall. Ron faces Hermione, as Neville encourages him, and then Ron flies backwards. Fred collects his winnings. Outside, Filch wakes from a doze while Nigel keeps watch as everyone leaves the room through another door. A student is ushered into Umbridge's room. Nigel floats in mid-air as Harry guides Cho's wand, and she turns to look at him. Nigel plummets to the ground and tucks in, while the twins hide nearby. Red pustules break out all over Filch's face, and Umbridge snaps her pencil. Umbridge's squad, including Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle, and Filch, watches Luna skip along the corridor and go through the large wooden doors. The squad runs, the door shrinks, and they fall into a broom cupboard. Ginny Weasley's spell destroys the metal Dementor, which disintegrates into a pile of dust. She is amazed at her own skill, and her three brothers look rather put out. Harry beams and watches Cho, who gives him a shy smile. Neville is determined to succeed, and as a wand spins out of a girl's hand, Harry congratulates him. Harry smiles proudly as his pupils applaud, and the students start to leave. Ron and Hermione exchange a smile when they notice that Harry is watching Cho, who is lingering beside a mirror covered with photographs. Harry can't take his eyes off her. Ron and Hermione leave as Fred and George leave the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Cho in front of the mirror, where they both look at a moving photograph of a smiling Cedric. She smiles at him, and Cho looks up as something green and white appears above their heads. Harry gazes into her dark eyes, and their lips meet in a gentle kiss. They're standing close together, but only their lips touch, and above their heads, the bunch of mistletoe continues to grow. Ron looks blank as Harry catches his eye, and the three friends smile warmly. In a black corridor, Harry writhes in his sleep, and a snake is reflected in the shining black. The blue door and the glass sphere appear, along with the light of a wand and a figure in a room full of shelves. It's Mr. Weasley, his eyes wide with alarm. Harry's neck flexes as Mr. Weasley falls and struggles, then lies still, covered in blood. Harry wakes.",
    "563": "He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road. He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled. The Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a dozen frightened Mexicans, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head. He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine whining as it barrels down the road toward them. The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and squeals to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD. Two men get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. Kay, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, Dee, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents. Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants. He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish. Silence on the road. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there. Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway. He pulls out a small laser device, which he zips neatly down the front of the man's clothes. The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath—a scaly space bastard, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with a snout, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head. It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it. Mikey replies—an unfathomable combination of grunts, squeaks, and saliva. Mikey makes a lame squeak. From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified gasp. Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around too. All three of them see Agent Janus, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. Janus freezes, terrified. Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground. The other INS agents burst over the rise, shouting questions. From over the rise, car engines whine in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.",
    "706": "He tries to run off but one of the capacitors hits him, throwing him back onto the sand. The air is thick with sand as he gets to his feet, trying to shield his face. Tiny granules of high velocity sand fly into his pores and shatter into fragments, fusing with his own molecules, giving his internal structure a sand-like appearance. Flint's hand becomes sand, and his fingers blow away in a fierce wind. His entire body turns to sand and is eaten away by the wind until he completely disintegrates. The cops arrive at the edge of the pit and look down to find the capacitors slowing down and Flint nowhere to be seen. Peter sits alone in a hospital corridor, staring blankly at the paper cup in his hand. He looks up and hurriedly stands as a doctor approaches. The dark haired, bearded doctor goes, leaving Peter looking pensive. With a tentative step, he passes the window of a private room and looks inside. Harry is lying in bed with a bandage wrapped around his head. He turns to face the doorway and smiles as Peter steps inside. Mary Jane comes in. Mary Jane and Peter step into the corridor. Peter looks relieved. In the room, the nurse smiles at Harry. Large rocks roll and clink against each other. Seen from further away, the rocks look more like gravel, and from even further away the gravel reveals itself as millions of grains of sand which sweep along the floor of the pit like waves on a beach. The sand forms a curving shape, almost like a human body. The undulating shape rises up as though to stand, then slumps down again. The shape reforms and slowly rises in the form of a human torso from the waist up. It's Flint, now transformed into Sandman. Sandman raises his arms and examines his bulky, paw-like hands. He looks down at his body of sand, then holds his hands to his large, round head. Sandman looks at the mound of sand next to him and spots the locket Penny gave him lying nearby. He reaches out to pick up the locket but the loose sand of his hand just crumbles around it. He reaches out again and his hand becomes more human, with slim, mobile fingers. He picks up the locket between his finger and thumb, then drops it into his palm. The locket falls open, revealing Penny's picture inside. Sandman's hollow eyes look melancholy as they gaze down at the picture. He clenches the locket in his fist and hauls himself up from the sand like a man climbing out of a swamp. He stumbles as he finds his footing, then slowly steps forward, gradually becoming more human until he looks exactly as he did before the change, right down to his brown hair, green and black striped t-shirt, and beige chinos.",
    "442": "Don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen, and is just coming from it. He walks down the street about ten steps when Helen comes up to him, but Don disregards her and tries to go on. Helen overtakes him and blocks his way, but he continues on. Helen stands looking after him for a moment, then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop where the pawn broker has put her coat on a hanger and is brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact. In another scene, Don is at the desk writing on the second page of a letter, with a revolver beside him, ending with, \"But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn’t I? Goodbye.\" He puts down the pen, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer, and loads the gun. Having been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp, and he walks into the bathroom. Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror with the gun in his hand, notices the unbuttoned points of his collar, and with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, he hears a sound from outside, becomes startled, and puts the gun into the empty wash bowl. The door is being opened and Helen, breathing hard from her race to get there, enters with rain on her hair and face, and a wet dress. Don comes from the bathroom as Helen stands staring at him, wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too. She looks around desperately and sees the gun reflected in the shaving mirror. Before she can step toward it, Don returns with a scarf. Helen goes to the umbrella stand and takes out a bottle, puts down the raincoat and scarf, and goes to the kitchen for a glass. Don picks up the raincoat and scarf, bends down for a kiss, while Helen stands looking at him and holds out the glass. She turns, runs into the bathroom, and picks up the gun with Don following her. Helen holds the gun behind her while Don half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall. Overcome by a wave of weakness, he sags against the door, then goes and opens it.",
    "284": "She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house, and by her attitude, we can see that there is no truck outside. She looks about her for a moment. The figure of Stella is seen, looking up toward Jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture. Jeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged. He lowers the glasses and turns to Jeff. Shooting towards the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer, the second man standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is Police Detective Lieutenant Thomas J. Doyle, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He has a sense of humor. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. Doyle paces a little. He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat, and pauses his hand on the door knob. From Doyle's viewpoint, Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. Doyle, still at the door, starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. Doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window: Miss Torso, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the outside balcony. She is exciting and desirable, and he even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees. Jeff smiles at catching Doyle enjoying Miss Torso and notices Doyle's interest. Startled at being observed, Doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance. Jeff's face grows serious as Doyle quickly collects his thoughts and gets back to the case at hand. The camera moves back as Doyle returns to his drink, moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat, pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket, and Jeff watches him intently. Doyle looks at Jeff with some smugness, puts on his hat, and goes toward the door. The camera concentrates on the long-focus lens camera, which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich rests. Jeff's hand comes in and picks it up. We pan up with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. Jeff is sober, and except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness. As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood. The camera pans slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. Thorwald's apartment is in darkness as the sun has just set. We follow the basket down to the yard, which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view as she seems to be putting on the final touches of her makeup, prior to going out.",
    "1245": "She wipes mist off her bathroom mirror and brushes her teeth. Elsewhere in New York City, some very fashionable ladies are also getting dressed. The model-type women put on expensive-looking designer underwear. Andy roots through a jumbled drawer and pulls out a serviceable pair of white pants. One of the women, a fashionable blonde, selects a jacket from her extensive walk-in wardrobe. Another lady carefully coordinates her brown top with just the right skirt. Then, the fashionable ladies put on their designer makeup, working to achieve a flawless finish. In contrast, pretty Andy has put on a comfortable-looking mauve jumper over a white shirt and trousers, and dabs on a bit of lip gloss. The fashionable ladies make their jewelry selections, while Andy consults her appointment book. Andy flips through some political articles she wrote for the university newspaper. The well-dressed ladies pull on their high-heeled shoes and boots. Andy kisses scruffy boyfriend Nate goodbye as he sits reading in bed. The fashionable ladies scoop up their designer phones and bags and leave their swanky uptown apartments. Unfashionable Andy, who is slender and has long, dark hair, walks out of her downtown apartment followed by a gaggle of young schoolchildren out on a trip. A model-type measures out a small amount of cereal and adds some nuts to her breakfast. Andy stops at a bakery and walks down the street, unashamedly munching on an onion bagel. The fashionable ladies flag down taxicabs and get into chauffeur-driven cars, while Andy heads cheerfully down into the subway in her rather shapeless brown coat and clunky black heels. Andy makes her way down a busy city street, as smartly dressed businesspeople dash this way and that. Skyscrapers loom overhead on either side of the street. She arrives at a tall building housing Elias-Clark Publications and gazes up at its impressive facade. Clutching her battered, brown leather briefcase, she takes a deep breath and walks into the marble-floored reception hall and up to the desk. An elegant redhead is waiting. Andy follows Emily. Emily's BlackBerry. Emily springs into action as a sleek, silver car pulls up outside. Creative director Nigel leaves. Andy checks her onion breath. A chauffeur-driven car pulls up outside the building. Chic, grey-haired Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly gets out, carrying a designer handbag and a mockup of the magazine. Emily dashes into Miranda's office, puts a glass down on her desk, and fills it with mineral water. Andy watches a member of the editorial staff quickly binning her breakfast, and another changing her shoes. A woman uses a webcamming feature on her computer to touch up her makeup. Emily arranges a pile of magazines on Miranda's desk before quickly tidying up her own.",
    "780": "Guests gather for a wedding as a young bridesmaid sits and watches. The two girls walk back down the aisle, and the elder one admires herself in a mirror. The bride's dress is ripped, and Jane gives a knowing smile, eyeing the ribbon in Tess' hair. Jane proudly holds the train of the ribbon-repaired dress. Carrying the bulky dress in a bag, adult Jane, in a formal purple dress, hurries out of the shop onto a busy New York street. Pausing for breath on a street corner, another young woman wearing the same purple dress walks up. Tess nudges her bored friend. Jane rushes out of the ceremony and hurries over to the cab, where she starts getting changed in the back seat. The cabby looks in his mirror as they drive through the colorfully lit New York night, pulling up below the Brooklyn Bridge. She gets out of the cab wearing a red sari and places a jeweled bindi on a friend's forehead. Flinging herself back into the cab, she frantically starts changing again, and the cabby sneaks another look. She's back at the first wedding where a handsome, dark-haired guy who was at the ceremony watches her with raised eyebrows as she heads off in the cab again. She's dancing, first in her Indian dress and then, after another dive for the cab, in her purple one. After some energetic dancing, she emerges from another cab ride once more in her Indian finery and kicks off the wrong shoes. The cabby throws her the right ones, and she joins in some choreographed dancing. Later on, she catches the sari in the cab door. She helps both brides with their dresses as they sit on their toilets and gets back into the swing of the choreography at the Jewish Indian party. Then she rushes in disarray into the other wedding just as the bride and groom are stuffing cake into each other's mouths. It's a bindi. Jane smiles in delight, arms outstretched, as the bridal bouquet is thrown and sails straight towards her, then she's barged to the floor by an over-zealous competitor. Everything goes black. As Jane comes hazily to, the dark-haired guy is looking down at her. She blinks up at him, touches a hand to her sore head, and gives a tight smile as two other guests arrive. She sways unsteadily, clutching her head. The lights of the city twinkle in the night as the pair shares a cab, sitting as far apart as possible with a huge bunch of flowers between them. She pays, and Kevin grabs the flowers. The truck drives between them. As Kevin sits in the cab smiling to himself, he looks down and notices Jane's filofax on the floor. Looking thoughtful, he opens the filofax.",
    "1296": "Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently. As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. Then they see the dog is laying on its side and has a barbecue fork in its neck. Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth. He inhales the asthma spray and lowers the inhaler so he can speak. Graham stares at his ten-year-old son and starts crying. Graham picks him up in his arms and reaches up for Bo, who has dirt and tears on her face. She slowly climbs down, and Graham carries Bo as she cries in his arms. He starts towards the house. Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of potato salad and stands still. Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. Officer Paski is pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. Graham lies in bed, resting his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. He slowly gets up from the bed, takes his daughter's hand, and starts out of the room. They both sit quietly for a moment. He looks to his daughter with startled eyes, and Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window. A large silhouetted figure is seen. Graham stands as Merrill opens the front door. It's pitch black outside, and Merrill turns to Graham and gestures with his fingers, bringing them together at the end of the gesture. Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness. Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house, and Merrill waves his arms and turns a corner full speed. The large figure has come into view as Merrill's eyes drift above them. Graham starts out of the kitchen, while Bo watches cartoons. Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply. Graham and Edgar walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car, and Graham turns the car off as Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat. Downtown Bucks County is a group of small stores along a quiet street. The Hess family's station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter. Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around as Merrill puts change in the meter. Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo, holds out his hand for money, and after receiving it from Graham, takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk.",
    "213": "He is silent for a moment, then blurts out. By this time, a small crowd has collected to watch the above scene. Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and George is trying to quiet her. As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter. George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again. Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth. But after a few steps, he turns around and starts back. George stops, startled, and looks up. George looks surprised at this. But Mary has disappeared from the window. Mary is running down the stairs. Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel. It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon. Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George. George is struggling with the gate; he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary. Mary and George are in the entrance hall. They go through the doorway into the parlor. George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it. George and Mary are sitting on the divan. There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene. He looks at his watch, as though about to leave. He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive. Mrs. Hatch, in a bathrobe and with her hair in curlers, is leaning over the banister as she calls: George and Mary are seated on the divan. George is aghast. As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts ringing. Mary comes into the hall. As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front porch. George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings. She hands the instrument to George. Sam is seated at his desk, while a couple of his friends are nearby, with highballs in their hands. As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening. Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very conscious of her proximity. Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious of her, close to him. As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips. George can stand it no longer.",
    "1367": "Debbie is getting a mammogram, and the machine clamps too hard on her breast, causing her to scream. Meanwhile, Pete gets his testicles examined. Debbie then undergoes a colonoscopy and later endures some very painful oral surgery, feeling a little high from the laughing gas. Dr. Bowe performs a prostate exam on Pete. Debbie visits the gynecologist, revealed to be Dr. Pelligino from the beginning of \"Knocked Up,\" and her legs are up in stirrups as two nurses enter the exam room. Debbie enters the bedroom, Sadie runs down the hallway, and Charlotte tries to open the door, which is locked, while Debbie gives Pete a blow job out of frame, making Pete super happy sitting on a chair. Charlotte shoves Sadie, leading to an escalating physical fight and muffled screams from the girls outside. Pete walks to the front door, greeted by his father Larry, revealing his small house is too close to the airport due to a low flying 747. Pete and Larry sit down to talk, and two other identical children enter and jump on Larry before the three exit. Larry stands and walks outside, followed by Pete, and prepares to spray the kids with a hose, eventually spraying Pete instead, as Larry's wife, Claire, enters. Larry gets up and walks outside once again. A nervous Debbie approaches a hostess and sees Oliver sitting stiffly at a table. Oliver shows Debbie photos on his iPhone before exiting, leaving Debbie to sadly scroll through the happy pictures of his new family. The family relaxes at dinner, with Charlotte using an app on her iPhone that animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's while Sadie stomps off. Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway, arriving at a beautiful hotel in Laguna. Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise and runs into the bathroom looking for a cookie, which they both eat. They sit in silence, staring through each other in a haze, as they are stoned. As they enjoy their time, Pete and Debbie jump up and down on the bed, fall on it, kissing, and almost totally under the covers, watch as a waiter brings in a room service cart full of food. Pete does magic tricks for the waiter, and Debbie hands Pete a banana and two oranges, which he holds to his crotch in front of the waiter, before Pete takes a bite of the banana.",
    "391": "Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck. The Dude is encouraged and takes a hurried sip from his drink. Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope, which is distended by something inside. The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding, and unrolls it. The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside. The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package. Between thumb and forefinger, the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish. The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises. A waitress enters. The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him as he looks defiantly around. A dripping noise follows. The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head. He stares at his toes, which protrude from the soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub. After the Dude's outgoing message, we hear a dripping noise, and the Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying. One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor, as two other men enter behind him. The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal before the man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub; the Dude screams. The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression. The three men turn to leave and have reached the Dude's car, where the driver's side exterior has been scraped raw. A policeman hands the Dude a door handle and an exterior rear-view mirror, laughing and agreeing broadly, while the Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass. The Dude, Walter, and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts. Walter sadly shakes his head as they leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar, and he stares. He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam Elliot, perhaps, with a large Western-style mustache and wearing denims, a yoked shirt, and a cowboy hat. We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie. The Stranger nods and, waiting for his drink, looks amiably around the bar. His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude, who, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head. The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is, while the Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar.",
    "588": "Whip stands in a dark suit and watches the procession pass, when a young boy touches his arm, prompting him to turn around and see Margaret. He goes to her and they hug, as Margaret reaches for her son and pulls him close. Both watch as Trevor goes off to find his dad, then hug again. Margaret looks at Whip with tears in her eyes and they stare at each other, unmoving. He wipes her tears with his thumb, and Margaret watches him, her brow creased and her eyes soft with sympathy. He kisses her and leaves. Later, Whip leans against his car in a parking lot, watching an airplane overhead, as Nicole approaches in quick strides. They hug, and she hands him a Zippo, which he uses to stick a cigarette in his mouth. In a different scene, a man stands at a podium while Whip sits semi-slumped in a chair, as the majority in the room lift their hands, including Nicole, making Whip cross his arms before he leaves. Whip parks outside a bar and walks in as his co-pilot, Ken, appears on the news, but he soon exits the bar. At the hospital, Whip walks over to a private room and peeps in, tapping his cane on the door frame, while a nurse dresses Ken's wounds. Vicky and Ken look toward Whip, who closes the door, sits down, and later arises to leave. Ken reaches for Whip's hands, and after Whip's eyes dart up and down, he takes Ken's hands. Later, at Whip's family farm, Nicole sees the lights on in the hangar as Whip leans over the Cessna, still wearing his tie with his shirt's sleeves rolled up. He jumps off a ladder, hustles over to Nicole, and kisses her before sipping his beer, as she notices cocaine on the table. Nicole sits on the bed, ends a call, and continues packing her things in the bedroom, ignoring Whip. Whip takes a large swig before setting the bottle on a table and entering the bedroom, where Nicole walks past him, raising a hand to her head before sitting on the bed. He sits next to her on the bed, and she leans in, their foreheads touch, as he kisses her and she allows him to pull her into an embrace. In the morning, Whip lies sleeping on the bed, fully dressed, as Nicole stands at the bedroom entrance, looks at him, and leaves an envelope with Whip's name on it between his lighter and a bottle of whiskey. She carries a suitcase and a basket, walks away from the house, and puts her things in Sheila's van parked behind some trees, which then drives off. Whip stops as he sees the envelope, trots over to the table, picks it up, and opens it.",
    "479": "Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, and kisses him. Then, without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, and slips her feet into them. Finally, she pulls away and sits up. She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, and begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. Throughout the remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc. She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, and speaks with gentle and simple sincerity. He moves away, and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. He looks at her long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window, and stares at the wide sky. Mary goes out quickly, closing the door behind her, as Sam stares down at his shoeless feet. A small, moderately successful office off the main street, we see Mary get out of a cab, pay the driver, cross the pavement to the office door. Mary enters the office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, and finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last of her teens. Caroline rises and starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand, but breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY, enter the office. Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary and tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office. Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, and smiles a wet smile at Mary. Mary glances but cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, and tries to ignore the man's hot-breath closeness. Cassidy rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, and speaks to Mary meaningfully. Lowery starts after him but pauses and turns to Mary. Cassidy has gone into Lowery's office. Lowery starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle and smiles at it. Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, and starts to open the door as.",
    "875": "She unpacks a rabbit. A plate of vegetables and a fish with a gaping mouth is slid in front of Zoe. Zoe sits and stares at her dinner in horror, as Kate squeezes lemon over her fish. Zoe shakes her head. Kate's smile fades and she looks disappointed as Zoe gets up and leaves the table. Zoe sits in her bedroom, playing with a red-haired rag doll. Zoe looks sadly down at her doll as Kate goes. Patrons sitting in a window table smile and chat as they enjoy a meal. Kate rounds a corner and enters the restaurant, walking straight past Paula who's standing by the door chatting to two customers. Kate makes her way through the crowded dining area. Hearing singing, Kate slows down as she nears the kitchen. She meets Bernadette coming out with two plates. Kate walks into the kitchen. Leah's standing with a man holding a pastry brush. The man turns. He conducts. Kate watches in disbelief as the man raises his arms in the air and sings to the staff. He's holding an uncooked quail in his other hand. Kate turns to Paula. Kate whisks the man's coat off him. Paula leads the couple to their table. Kate and Paula go into a small glass-fronted room filled with well-stocked, floor-to-ceiling wine racks. Kate's speechless. She looks over at Nick, who stands grinning at her. Kate points at a pan on the stove next to him. The contents have caught fire. Kate shakes her head at Paula in disbelief, then grabs her bag and heads out. A flicker of a smile plays on Paula's lips. Kate wearily climbs the stairs to her apartment. A packet of chopsticks have been sellotaped to her door. She bends down and picks up a plastic take-away bag. She takes the chopsticks off the door and walks inside. She walks down the hallway to Zoe's bedroom. Kate pokes her head around the open door, then tries to enter her own bedroom. The door won't budge. She forces it open a crack. Kate sees Zoe curled up, asleep on her bed. Kate walks into the bathroom and enters her bedroom through an adjoining door. A chair has been propped up against the bedroom door to prevent anyone from entering. Kate walks over and moves it aside, along with a wicker laundry basket. Kate steps slowly towards the bed and picks up the remote control, which is lying next to Zoe. She turns off the TV. Kate looks down at her sleeping niece, then places the remote on a chest of drawers. She gently covers Zoe with the bedclothes, then notices a photo album, which had been hidden beneath them. Kate moves the photo album around and begins to look through it.",
    "29": "He looks at Rick and says nothing as Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink, which Laszlo takes. Rick then reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it, takes out a cigarette, and lights it, before looking away for a moment. Suddenly, there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed by the forced entry of several gendarmes, as a French officer walks in and addresses Laszlo, who looks at Rick for a moment, then crosses to the officer in dignified silence, and together they walk toward the door. Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing of his feelings, when they are interrupted by an orderly. Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who exits, and the conversation continues. Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously fingers his hat. Renault gets out of his chair, crosses to the front of his desk, retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box, chain-lights it with the old one, and sits back down. Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault, who presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER as the door to Renault's office opens and Rick rises to go. A waiter brings tea to Rick and Ferrari, who sit alone at a table in a secluded nook off the main room, where Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip, then gets up, followed by Ferrari, and they shake hands to seal the deal. Rick walks to the door, stops, turns around, and leaves, while Ferrari picks up a fly swatter from the table and swats a fly. A car pulls quickly to a stop just outside the cafe, on the door of which a huge placard reads, as Renault looks around the empty cafe. Rick points at his breast pocket before they hear the CRUNCH of tires as a car pulls up. Renault walks up the stairs to Rick's office, and Ilsa quickly walks toward the entrance as Laszlo pays the cab driver. Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment, as Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself. Renault opens the office door and peers down at the proceedings. They all walk towards the bar, where Laszlo deposits his hat on a nearby table, takes out the letters, and hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully. All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking toward them from the bottom of the stairs, catching Ilsa and Laszlo completely off guard, with horror in Ilsa's eyes. Renault takes the letters, and they turn toward Rick, bewildered, while Renault is obviously delighted by the situation.",
    "906": "He works his lips as Nitti listens to the radio and then phones D'Andrea. Cardboard tags label switchboard cables at the telephone exchange as two female operators work an adjacent switchboard with an agent standing by. Outside, on a moonlit shoreline, Dillinger sits by a sleeping Billie, whose hair hangs in her face. Dillinger gazes at her, brushes her dark hair aside to reveal her big eyes, and she briefly lowers her gaze before smiling. He takes her in his arm, with the horizon sprawling flat between the sand and black sky. Dillinger's car parks on a street, and Billie smiles at him before getting out. Peering through his round sunglasses, Dillinger watches her go, then looks into his side view mirror and sees only a man at a mailbox, a vagrant, and a few pedestrians. In her fur-collared coat, Billie crosses the street between passing vehicles and enters the building. In the car, Dillinger faces the side mirror and brushes his bangs off his forehead. Inside, Billie passes through another doorway where Purvis' men grab her, handcuff her, and she uncomfortably glances at the agents. Outside, Dillinger waits in the car as more armed agents exit a building directly in front of him, and he startles slightly, but the G-men step right past, realizing he's inside, and cross the street. Dillinger takes off his sunglasses as the agents restraining Billie indoors lead her outside. Dillinger glares into his side mirror, then gets out of the car. The two lovers make eye contact as the burly agent marches Billie away, shoving her toward a government car. Dillinger steps forward with a pistol in hand as the burly agent pushes Billie into the back seat and gets in next to her. As they drive away, Billie peers through the back window, sitting between two agents, and a shocked Dillinger stands out in the open, watching the car drive off. Several armed agents remain behind on the sidewalk but fail to notice Dillinger, who strides around a parked car and returns to his vehicle. Dillinger gets in, shuts the door, grips the steering wheel, bows his head, and collects his breath. His car backs out, leaving the remaining agents behind, and the gangster wipes his reddened face, holding a hand over his mouth as he sobs. In a dim interrogation room, the burly agent leans in front of Billie, who sits in a chair, with his partner standing behind her. She slouches with her left cheek bruised as the interrogator smacks her, grabs her chin, flings her head to the side, and stands upright. The interrogator steps out of the room as Billie trembles, with her right hand cuffed to the chair, holding her knees together.",
    "900": "As Red and Homer return fire, Baby Face shoots at a townsman who holds a pistol at his side. Dillinger crawls to the dead gangster, looks sadly at Tommy, then turns his attention back to the fight. As Baby Face raises his gun to fire again, a guy jumps on his back, and Baby Face tosses him into a window. Dillinger joins the others, firing at the second story window across the street, with dust billowing around it as bullets hit the exterior stone wall. Red glances over his shoulder as Dillinger reloads his gun and fires it at a man hiding behind a car. He hurries to Baby Face and drags him, who continues to shoot. With its door still open, the car pulls out of the town square, leaving the hostages lying helplessly in the street. The car speeds down an empty road lined with tall evergreens that jut into the pale blue sky. Golden sunlight shines on its sleek exterior, reflecting the snow-covered ground bordering the woods. Dillinger sits in the backseat, the wind from the open windows blowing against his disheveled hair. In the front passenger seat, Homer stares distantly. Behind him, Dillinger drinks from a flask as Red administers an injection into his shoulder wound. Nighttime comes, and the car's headlights glow eerily through the trees as it makes its way through the dark woods. The night casts a turquoise hue over Dillinger, who clutches his shoulder in the backseat. The car slows as it approaches a lodge where light shines warmly through the windows. As Baby Face pulls the car to a halt, Dillinger addresses him with a frown. The four gangsters enter the lodge. Upstairs, Baby Face bundles cash while Red preps a dressing and Homer looks on. Red unrolls a bandage and dresses Dillinger's wound. Homer grabs his take as Baby Face picks up two cash bundles and tosses one to Shouse. As they both clear out of the room, Homer hangs back in the doorway, looks to Dillinger, who gives a nod, and Homer leaves. Red remains seated at Dillinger's side. As Red wipes his hands, Dillinger springs restlessly to his feet, and the two men share a solemn look. Dillinger holds out Red's share. Red accepts the cash, gives his brow a resigned lift, and shoots a tentative smile at Dillinger. He stows the cash in his bag and leaves. Now in a medical exam room, the gangster with the eye wound pleads with two G-men. Purvis halts a doctor and courteously gestures for the doctor to step away. The interrogator pushes on the man's wound while Purvis stands with his back to the torture session. The gangster spits at his tormentor, and the stern-faced G-man turns gravely towards Purvis and nods.",
    "143": "The crowd is running and screaming. He looks off at the crowd, his eyes narrowing. A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, with some disappearing, while a few heroic individuals astride the wall reach down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below. Dyer glances woodenly at the panel, a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise. The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief, more at his attitude than his statement. He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point. The evasiveness and only half-buried embarrassment of their response deepen his own withdrawal into himself, and Dyer thinks about it. There is a muted reaction from the public section. The Indian barrister stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes. For the first time, there is a hint of uncertainty in his manner. There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel as Dyer looks at him quickly, and that answer stops the Advocate. He smiles dryly. Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut. There is quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry. The camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall. We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, and the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety. Finally, the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left. Gandhi is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly and desolately, with Nehru standing a few feet away from him, sharing the same benumbed grief and incredulity. The camera continues its pan over bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, and little pieces of clothing. There is the imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India with Chelmsford pacing along one side of a large conference table. This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader. The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer—coolly, but accepting it—and that lifts Chelmsford's hopes a little. It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry. The British are stunned almost to speechlessness by the audacity and impossibility of it—and from Gandhi, of all people. The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to recover, while Gandhi and the others just look at him. Chelmsford, realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.",
    "196": "He waves as he exits through the door. A flaming plane crashes into the sea. George, behind the counter, is trying to quiet a crowd of people all clamoring for more ration points. George shouts. George, in the uniform of an air raid warden, is patrolling his beat. A man beside a lighted window pulls down the shade as George blows his whistle. George is helping load his old car with scrap paper. A wheelbarrow full of junk is being dumped onto a pile. It is a raw, gusty day, and his overcoat and muffler flap in the breeze. George is walking along the sidewalk reading a newspaper. Draped around one arm is a large Christmas wreath. Under his other arm are several more copies of the paper. George comes to where Ernie, the taxi driver, is standing on the sidewalk. The front page of the paper, the Bedford Falls Sentinel, has a subhead telling of a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N., on his way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of dignitaries, and a picture of the transport which Harry saved. Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story. Gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and joins them. Uncle Billy is walking along the street, humming happily to himself. The outer door opens and George enters. The offices are unchanged, still small-time and old-fashioned. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are talking on the phone. The same office force, albeit a few years older: Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace. Seated on a chair is a middle-aged man with a briefcase. Cousin Eustace has turned away from George and caught a glimpse of the man waiting in the chair. This is Carter, the bank examiner, come for his annual audit of the books of the Building and Loan. George gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath, and goes over to Carter. They shake hands. Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks. He grabs the paper from Potter's hand. Uncle Billy folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man. In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward his office. Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward the deposit window with his deposit slip. Uncle Billy hands the bank book over. The teller opens it, starts to punch it with rubber stamps. Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has. The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of the numerous strings tied around his fingers.",
    "1287": "A sphere rises over the Great Wall of China, another over the Pyramids, and from all over the world, glowing spheres head into space, away from Earth's atmosphere. Klaatu walks in slow-motion through the woods, a shadow emerging through the mist, as Jacob glares at him and reluctantly obeys. They are caught in the police car's spotlight as Helen backs away from Klaatu in horror; Klaatu's face appears on the cop's computer as the officer drives up to them, looking shocked. With a touch, Klaatu sends Helen's car crashing into the cop, crushing him against his own cruiser, then releases Helen's car as the cop slumps dead to the ground. Klaatu scoops some of the fatty flesh from the sample jar and touches a hand to the police cruiser, activating all its systems. Helen and Jacob stare as he then reaches down with his other hand and touches the alien flesh to the officer's head; power surges through the man's body, and the officer rolls over—he’s alive. They stare at one another as Klaatu looks around, hearing the sirens. Meanwhile, Mike is with the Defense Secretary, and a robot is floating down a deep, concrete-walled shaft as the light in its head slit comes on. Helen's car is parked in the rain, and a grandfather clock shows 5 past 11 as Helen leads the way into the house, into a study. Klaatu walks into the next room, which has books piled everywhere, and approaches a chalkboard covered in figures; he erases a highly complex formula. Helen turns away looking worried and approaches Jacob, stroking the boy's hair affectionately. Klaatu writes his own formula on the chalkboard as a gray-haired man watches him work, then approaches him and picks up a piece of chalk to also start writing. Klaatu glances at Karl's work, then moves to another part of the board, and Karl pauses to look at his figures as Helen watches them both curiously. Klaatu draws a sweeping arrow across the board, connecting the formulas as Karl continues to write, and Klaatu adjusts some of his equations, studies Karl, then turns away from the chalkboard, walks across the room, and looks up at the speaker through which the music is playing. Lights shine in the dark at Mount Weather Flash Facility, Bluemont, Virginia, where a suited agent steps into the operations room separated from a circular chamber by thick windows; the windows look out onto the vast head and shoulders of GORT, whose light in his head is glowing orange and tracks the agent's every move. The agent stares at GORT, walks slowly forwards, then backs nervously away from the window as Klaatu studies him thoughtfully and walks out of the room through the French windows out onto a terrace.",

She looks into his eyes for a moment as he lays his head on her shoulder before she turns back and gazes out beyond the foot of the bed. Her eyes close, and Audrey opens them again as David closes his, and his face relaxes. Joseph, in a green T-shirt with white and gold bands around the middle, walks downstairs and into the kitchen, where Audrey and David are at the table, leaning towards each other, holding hands. They look around at him, smiling. David picks up the paper, and Audrey goes to the cooker, wearing a white T-shirt and green and white striped pajama bottoms. Joseph sits at the table, looking up at her cautiously as David continues to read the paper. She turns from the cooker, and David continues to read, looking up and nodding at last. Joseph unscrews the cap of a big carton of orange juice and carefully pours himself half a glass full. He replaces the cap, stands to remove the carton from the table, and sits again, staring at the glass. The paper slides surreptitiously across the table to him. Joseph looks up at his father, who almost imperceptibly nods down at the story. Joseph pulls the paper to him and reads. Beside the headline is a black and white drawing of the heroic figure in a cape, with a particularly prominent square jaw. Joseph gazes down at the paper, his lips moving slightly, and looks up at David, mouth open. David nods expressionlessly. Joseph closes his mouth, swallows, and blinks hard. David puts a finger to his lips, and Joseph nods and wipes away a tear. David glances down, then looks up and gives Joseph a smile. At the Limited Edition Gallery, a bored security man looks at a picture, and a waitress carries a tray of food amongst the smartly dressed guests. Elijah is talking to a couple from his wheelchair, and David wanders in wearing a casual brown jacket and open-neck shirt, glances around him, and stops in front of a picture. A black woman with gray hair approaches him and looks across the busy gallery, and David looks across the busy gallery as well. Elijah wheels his chair from the gallery down the narrow corridor lined with comics, and David follows. Elijah freewheels down a ramp into his office and swings the chair around to face David. He's wearing a tight black leather zip-up jacket with short glittering blue lapels. He reaches to a shelf behind him and picks up a paper, looks at it, and turns it round, showing David the drawing of the hero in the cape.",

Jacob looks at him directly and nods, then he nods again and turns away. Cal turns and stares directly ahead as Jacob gets off his bar stool and soldiers out, putting his hands in his pockets. Cal downs his shot. At school, all the kids have dressed smartly and lined up on a long row at the back of tiered seating constructed in the hall. Cal walks past the kids and over to the seating, looking across the hall and spying Emily with Molly and Hannah. His eyes light up hopefully when he spots an empty seat next to Hannah, but then he sees Jacob stamping over a chair to take the seat next to her. Cal looks away and heads upstairs, making his way to a seat on the other side of the structure. Cal points to a seat between a man and woman who are chatting, and the guy leans back so Cal can sit down. On the stage, Robbie in a suit, sits slumped at the end of a row. Cal eyes him and smiles softly. Robbie looks up and sees Jessica sitting with her parents and looks down miserably. The principal walks onto the stage and up to the podium, and Emily's jaw tightens. Kate takes the podium, and Cal beams and claps proudly as Emily, Molly, Hannah, and Jacob clap and cheer. Robbie gets up, and Jessica smiles as Robbie plods over to the podium. Emily smiles and glances at Molly, while Cal frowns and Emily’s face falls. Robbie looks at Cal, who stands up, causing the audience to all turn to him. Cal makes his way down the seating structure, squeezing past Bernie as Robbie's eyes start to find. Kate leans into the principal and whispers something, to which the principal nods. Cal faces the audience, and Kate puts her middle finger up at him. Cal turns to glance at Robbie as Emily's eyes brim. Tearfully, Emily smiles as Claire and Bernie glance at each other and smile. Emily's jaw slackens as Cal turns back to Robbie, and Emily smiles and looks down. Cal turns back to Robbie, who beams. Jessica hangs her head, giggling, as Emily laughs. Claire glances at Jessica with a worried look, and Emily wipes away a tear. Cal puts his arm around Robbie, and they leave the podium. In the school grounds, the kids and parents stand around chatting as Emily, Molly, Jacob, and Hannah head over to Cal and Robbie. Hannah and Cal wrap their arms around each other, and Cal eyes Jacob as Hannah steps back. Cal addresses Jacob, who steps forward nervously, and Cal holds out his hand. They shake, and Jacob smiles before Cal slaps Jacob.",

He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as he immediately goes to The Kid and pinches his cheek. The Mother ignores it and beats a retreat, and she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then The Kid does his best to smile, suddenly passionate. The two of them are together as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed, and the story he's reading about transforms the monochromatic look of the bedroom into the dazzling color of the English countryside. Buttercup stands holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, Westley, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Buttercup, in her late teens, doesn't care much about clothes and hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world. Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup and maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her as she walks away. Westley is outside chopping wood as Buttercup drops two large buckets near him. She leaves, but his eyes stay on her. She stops and turns, and he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him. Westley enters with an armload of firewood, gets it, and hands it to her; they stand very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes. Westley and Buttercup, outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset, are locked in a passionate kiss. They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace; he smiles at her, she smiles too, and throws her arms tightly around him. They kiss, and then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go. Buttercup stares out the window of her room, holding on her face, perfect and perfectly sad. In the main courtyard of Florin, replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace, Prince Humperdinck, a man of incredible power and bearing, stands in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others stand behind him: an old couple with crowns, the aging King and Queen, and a dark-bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: Count Rugen. A giant staircase leads to the crowd, and as a figure just begins to become visible, the crowd sees the figure and collectively holds its breath. The staircase reveals the figure appearing in the archway, and she is resplendent as she descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people. The crowd does a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.",
    "156": "Finally, Azad takes just a step forward, and Gandhi looks up at him. For a moment he folds his hands absently, then stands. He moves to Ba's side and kneels. Ba's eyes flutter open, and she holds her hand out to him, which he takes. When he goes to release it, she clutches it, so Gandhi hesitates, then sits, holding Ba's hand in his lap. He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go. Mirabehn smiles weakly, gives Ba a last little rub of farewell, and stands. Patel stands, allowing Mirabehn to pass him and go down the corridor with Azad. He looks back at Gandhi sitting, holding Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare. A fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight. Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness. The doctor appears in the doorway, pauses, and nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba, crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears, placing the acoustic bell over her heart. After a moment, he lifts it slowly, his face confirming what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi, whose posture is utterly unchanged, Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks. The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead and the living, as Gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation, as though he may never move again. Mirabehn watches him, her face wet with tears. A piece of cloth shimmers in a stiff breeze. For a moment, we hold it in silence, then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder. Slowly, the camera pulls back, revealing the cloth as part of a pennant on the nose of an aircraft. The scene cuts from the pennant to the aircraft stopping before a reception area, with a carpet rolled out toward its door.",
    "64": "He is stopped cold, and swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water using the fence. Drenched and battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car, fishes for his car keys, and looks down to see that one shoe is missing. He starts to get into his car, but Mulvihill and a smaller man stop him, with Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms tightly. The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril. Frozen, with the knife in his nostril and the street lamp gleaming on the blade, the smaller man quickly flicks back the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes screams as blood gushes onto his shirt and coat, and he bends over instinctively to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him as he grovels on his hands and knees, and on the ground, he can only see his tormentor's two-tone wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood. He is lightly shoved into the ground, the sound of footsteps retreating as he gasps. He later sits behind his desk, back to the camera, not moving. Duffy sits staring at nothing while Walsh moves uneasily around the room and Gittes slowly turns to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose, looking irritated, and picks up the phone as Walsh begins to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story, finishing with the punch line and making both men laugh raucously. Gittes drops the mail, loafs through it, puts his hand over the receiver, and looks at his two men. Seated, he flips through the paper to find the obituary column, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper, and puts it into his pocket. Evelyn Mulwray stands at the table as he does so, and he rises to allow her to sit. She's wearing subdued, tailored dove-gray gabardine, and as the waiter appears, Evelyn looks at Gittes' nose, then down to smooth her gloves. Looking back up, she stares expectantly at Gittes, who pulls out and fingers a torn envelope. He coughs, smiles, and looks significantly at Evelyn, who is clearly angry but controlling it, which subdues Gittes a bit. Evelyn is still slightly heated and then appears a little embarrassed for the first time, looking squarely at Gittes, who nods while fingering the envelope. Evelyn turns toward Gittes, who leans on the open door of his car, talks quietly, but spits it out.",
    "1085": "Malbin hurries up to meet him. Handing Malbin the gun, Tuvia runs off to investigate. He whips back a curtain across the door of a cabin. Lilka, Bella, and Riva are with Tamara and her baby. He strides away. Tuvia gazes at Lilka and his face softens. She plants a kiss on his lips. He looks at her in mute surprise. She stands in front of him unflinching. Slowly he moves his mouth towards hers, lightly brushing her lips. They kiss more fully. He smiles and their lips meet again. Beyond some trees, a German truck full of soldiers drives across a metal bridge followed by a car. Aron, hiding behind a tree, watches faithfully. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin are hunched over their chess set. A message bag, a German courier. People crowd round the blond head German. Tuvia checks Aron's cheek, then sits down at the table and opens the courier's leather case. He hands a document to Shimon. Malbin watches anxiously as people's anger turns to violence. Tuvia has his back turned as a bearded Jew spits on a man, and Shelman, the man who brought him, kicks him in the back. Tuvia and Shimon hurry over. Tuvia remains at a distance watching the mob take over. The German is felled. Aaron, his cheek swollen, turns away. Bella viciously slams the man with her rifle butt. Tuvia glances at Asael and walks off. Shimon and Malbin wincing, watch the mob savagely beat the man to death, with eyes dulled and a numbed expression. Tuvia comes across Aron sitting hunched on a mossy bank, his rifle on his lap, a hand to his mouth. Tuvia leans against a tree and watches his young brother's distress. Asael observes from a distance. At night, a guard patrols the camp. In his cabin, bathed in golden lamplight, Tuvia is sitting up in bed bare-chested with Lilka lying against him, covered by a blanket. He pulls her close to him and they settle down to sleep. Early one morning, at the army camp, Zus strides into Viktor's tent. Viktor turns to Zus. Zus turns to leave the commander's hut. Zus strides past Lova, glancing at a German plane crossing the sky. At the camp Tuvia and Malbin see it too. People pack up their belongings, guns and grenades loaded into baskets and bags. Tuvia peers up to the sky at a plane changing direction. He dives towards Aron as the bomber passes overhead. People run in all directions as bombs explode around them. Many are hit. Tuvia and Lilka herd women and children through the smoke and flame towards the largest bunker. A woman is hit. More and more people are bundled into the shelter.",
    "1017": "Colin drives along in his silver BMW convertible with Abby beside him, and they smile and chat as they head along a winding road through mountains, across a steel girder bridge, and through rolling countryside. Sitting on rocks beside a creek, Abby and Colin have a picnic where they clink glasses and drink wine; Colin teases Abby with some caviar, then pops it into her mouth, after which he looks away. Abby chews, winces, spits the caviar out, and grimaces, but quickly wipes her hand across her mouth, composes herself, and smiles at Colin. Abby and Colin walk barefoot over rocks spanning the creek; he wraps his arms around her, and they share a lingering kiss. In a coffee shop, Colin buys coffees for Abby and Joy, who grin girlishly and go to a table, and as Colin pays, Joy mimes giving him a good seeing to, clenching her fists and thrusting her groin. On set, Mike is spooning chocolate into the mouth of a sexy babe when a man delivers a bouquet of red roses to Abby; her mouth hangs open, and she and Joy do a little dance, which makes Mike's face fall as he turns back to the babe and sees he's smeared chocolate over her face, then distractedly wipes it off. Mike and Abby sit in the SF Saloon and Grill, where Abby is on the phone smiling at him while Mike checks out an attractive woman wearing a crop top, who's standing at the bar, drinking a shot. Abby looks round at the woman as Mike stares at her intensely before Abby drinks her wine. Mike frowns, taken aback, and looks troubled as Abby watches Mike on the monitor, steps up, frowns, goes to see Stuart in his office, and rolls her eyes. In Los Angeles, outside the expensive modern facade of the Century Plaza Hotel, Abby arrives in a yellow cab, and a bellman opens the door for her to get out. Abby walks through the lobby before they're driven through town, with Abby watching and smiling while Mike looks uncomfortable and then forces a smile. At La Noche Cubana restaurant, Mike walks up to a hostess who leads him away, and the colorful restaurant is decorated with palms while Abby sits in a booth overlooking the dance floor where couples salsa. She's on the phone to Stuart, and Mike sits and smiles at Abby, nods, while Abby sips her drink as a waitress walks up and Mike looks at Abby, who smiles thoughtfully. He takes her by the hand, throws his jacket aside, and Mike leads Abby onto the dance floor and spins her, turns, ducks under her arm, and pulls her close as they smile and dance together, back and forth. Mike spins Abby and leads her, and she steps away, holding his hands, and returns with her back to him.",
    "990": "At the graveside, Benjamin turns to Mrs. Maple's dog, and Daisy watches as he says his goodbyes. Tizzy shakes hands with Benjamin, and Queenie hugs him. Red-haired Daisy watches as he heads off. Carrying a kit bag and a suitcase, Benjamin, who now looks in his late 60s, walks along the sidewalk until he gets to the end of the road. He stops and sees Daisy running after him, but she turns and runs back down the street. Benjamin carries on up the road. In the hospital, Caroline opens a box full of old postcards tied up with ribbon. Meanwhile, Daisy does a pirouette. Captain Mike and Benjamin are on the snow-covered deck, where Mike points to a tattoo on his chest and makes a figure of eight with his hand. The twins start to fight. In an elevator, Benjamin now looks in his 50s. To Benjamin, as he follows them out of the lift. Back on the snow-covered deck of the tugboat, the tug is towing a gigantic ship. Later, Benjamin lies in bed in the hotel and finds Elizabeth in the lobby of the hotel. She's sitting on a sofa, a dressing gown over her nightdress, reading. Benjamin, in his dressing gown, heads towards the kitchen, then turns back to her. He goes through to the kitchen and Elizabeth stares after him, closes the magazine she was reading, and gets to her feet. She peers into the kitchen, where Benjamin is busy making the tea, and walks in as Benjamin looks up. Elizabeth opens her mouth as if about to say something. Benjamin goes over to her worktop and picks up two Russian tea glasses and their holders, puts the fly-ridden honey pot down, and carries the tea glasses and the teapot over to a table. Elizabeth takes a seat as Benjamin pours the tea. Benjamin sits down, and they eye each other across the table. Elizabeth wags her forefinger, and Benjamin checks on the teapot. Elizabeth looks a little awkward as he pours her a cup, which she sips thoughtfully. They share a smile, sip their tea, and both smile again. Heavy snow falls over the tugboat. Later, Benjamin comes downstairs, and Elizabeth gets up to greet him, looking a little flustered as she turns to Benjamin and heads off. In the hospital, at the ballet school, young Daisy reads Benjamin's card and, looking sad, she dances with other students in front of a panel of judges. At night in the hotel, Benjamin comes downstairs into the lobby and finds Elizabeth wearing an evening dress. They sit at a table in the hotel dining room where Benjamin tentatively tries a spoonful of caviar.",
    "1154": "Harry scrambles up and reaches high above his head for a broomstick as the dragon gets closer and closer, with the Firebolt stuck fast. Harry frees the broomstick as the dragon lashes out and smashes the window to pieces. He falls from a great height, pursued by the Horntail, but reappears out of the mist once again astride his broomstick. A dragon is close behind, and a burst of flame sets the end of Harry's broomstick on fire. It continues to smolder as the dragon zooms after Harry through a stone arch, with the massive viaduct ahead. Harry flies towards it and hurtles through one of the narrow openings at the top. As the dragon tries to bat, its huge wings smash into the brickwork, and Harry and the Horntail plunge into the valley far below. The crowd of spectators in the arena scan the sky with nervous anticipation, with Dumbledore and Fudge looking very concerned. Hagrid shields his eyes as he looks up into the empty sky until a tiny speck appears in the distance, prompting Hermione to scream. Harry hovers for a moment, then aims the Firebolt down towards the gleaming golden egg, triumphantly snatching it up. In a packed Gryffindor common room, the painted characters in the pictures join in the applause, and the twins hoist Harry onto their shoulders. The egg glows as Harry twists it open, and they clap their hands over their ears. Ron appears in the doorway as Harry closes the egg, facing Harry awkwardly as the twins usher everyone away and Hermione shakes her head, bemused. Gray clouds are reflected in the waters of the lake while owls fly in and out of the great hall. Parvati and Padma Patil walk together down the length of the hall and pass the table where Harry and his friends are eating breakfast. Harry sees Cho at the next table, and as her friend points him out, Cho smiles, causing Harry to dribble his drink in embarrassment. Hermione reads the paper as a small boy lingers at Ron's elbow, and Hermione looks curious as he unpacks a strange brown garment and holds it up, revealing white frills. The twins try it, while Ron gets up reluctantly with his shirt hanging out, and Filch starts the gramophone. The twins grin as the girls get up enthusiastically, but none of the boys move until Neville stands up. Later, Harry and Ron find Neville waltzing by himself around the bedroom, wearing his pajamas and a pair of shiny dancing shoes. Ron and Harry approach Cho and her friends, grinning inanely before moving on hurriedly, and Harry smiles at a group of Beauxbatons girls who stalk off. Meanwhile, Hagrid and Madame Maxime are together, and Madame Maxime reaches down to pick something from Hagrid's beard, pops it in her mouth, and licks her fingers seductively. Finally, Hermione, Harry, and Ron sit beside the lake.",
    "1049": "A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Darcy emerges from the parsonage with his lips drawn tight, pulling on his dark leather gloves. Inside, Lizzie begins to pace around the drawing room, and tears spring into her eyes. Meanwhile, Darcy hurries into a room upstairs, looking deeply troubled, and stands in the middle of the room. He dashes over to a bureau, pulls out a sheet of paper, picks up a pen, dips it into an ink pot, then sets about writing a letter. He replenishes the nib with ink, puts down the pen, and leans back in his chair with a defeated air. Next, he goes over to the paned window, observing the two young boys with their fishing rods and nets scrambling down a hill towards the river. Darcy strides through cloisters in his gown and mortarboard and throws open a door to find Wickham in a compromising position with a lady, but Wickham just smiles at him. Darcy hands Wickham a check, and as Wickham turns at the door, he bumps into Darcy's sister and kisses her hand with a flirtatious smile. Georgiana and Wickham walk arm-in-arm by the sea. Darcy's carriage pulls up at the sea front, and he jumps down to peer over a wall, seeing Wickham and Georgiana on the rocks below together. Georgiana spies her brother and her face breaks into a smile. When the door has closed behind Wickham, Georgiana turns her sorrowful gaze to Darcy and slowly walks over to be comforted by him. With the letter finished, a now disheveled Darcy leans wearily back in his chair and closes his eyes, then, with renewed energy, dips his pen in the ink pot once more. Outside, the sun is setting, casting a salmon pink glow over Rosings. The next morning, Darcy splashes his face with water from a silver basin, then pats it dry. He's still wearing the same white shirt from the night before, with the top few buttons undone, and his manner is troubled and agitated. He snuffs out last night's candle, which is all but burned out, and on the bureau is the sealed letter addressed to Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy wanders over to the breakfast table, then heads out, leaving the others to resume their breakfast. It's a bright, sunny day, and Lizzy takes a walk in the park, swinging her bonnet casually to and fro. Suddenly, she breaks into a run, racing as fast as she can across the grass, slows down to a walk again, and heads onward through the trees, not really taking in her surroundings. Suddenly, she becomes aware of a man standing with his back to her, a few meters ahead, and he turns just as she's trying to slip away unnoticed.",
    "1277": "Hermione smiles as Ron races after the three students, and Harry starts climbing a mountain of furniture to reach the diadem, with Hermione following. Harry finds a blue Pixie in the junk and tosses it aside, but more Pixies fly out, causing him to climb frantically, with Hermione beside him. He sees the diadem wedged in the sofa, wrenches it out, and they clamber back down to the floor, looking down the aisle where the entrance is glowing. A huge wave of flames surges towards them, uniting with a second wave and pursuing Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry knocks over furniture to slow it down and looks back as the furniture is consumed by the inferno, which takes the form of a fiery winged dragon. Goyle tries to extinguish flames from his burning wand, while Draco and Blaise back away. Goyle tosses his wand into the fire as Hermione and Ron sprint ahead of the flames, with Harry pursued by a flaming serpent in a different aisle. Terrified, Draco and his cronies scramble up a high stack of furniture. Reunited, Harry, Hermione, and Ron see flames ahead, turn, and find themselves surrounded. Harry conjures a protective shield, and Ron falls back against broomsticks, tossing them to his friends. They soar upwards as Goyle climbs after Draco and Blaise, but dislodges a chair and falls into the inferno, with Draco and Blaise watching him fall. Ron turns to Harry as Draco and Blaise lose their grip and cling to a carpet by their fingertips. Harry looks around, they swing their brooms, and Harry flies past, just missing Draco's hand. On another pass, Harry grabs Draco onto the broom, and Ron grabs Blaise. Hermione leads them, swerving to avoid burning furniture, clears a path with her wand, and they make it out through the doors, falling off the broomsticks. Draco runs, and Harry sees the diadem on the ground. Hermione tosses him a Basilisk's Fang, which he sinks into the diadem, causing black smoke to rise. Ron kicks the diadem back into the burning room, where three fiery images of Voldemort appear. As they back away, the doors slam shut, and gasping, Harry leans against a pillar. Nagini coils as Voldemort falters, Harry shivers in the light, and Voldemort, with a sweaty face, turns in the dark to face his army. A group of Death Eaters, led by Pius Thicknesse, steps forward, and a spell kills Thicknesse.",
    "1172": "Snow falls onto the tars and turrets of the school as Hagrid, wearing a huge fur coat, plods across the snow-covered courtyard, dragging behind him an enormous Christmas tree. Inside the school, Hermione pulls a trunk on wheels past a group of ghostly carol singers and enters the great hall, where tiny Professor Flitwick waves his wand and levitates decorations onto a tall Christmas tree. Hermione finds Ron and Harry playing chess at one of the long polished tables and walks down the brightly decorated hall to join them. The white knight moves by itself, and as Ron contemplates the board, the red queen moves and knocks the knight's head off. Meanwhile, Harry's snowy owl turns its head as Harry leaps out of bed and puts on his spectacles. Down in the Gryffindor common room, Ron stands in front of a blazing fire while Harry runs barefoot down the stone stairs towards a pile of presents on the Christmas tree. Harry picks up a parcel, and Ron dips into a box of every flavor beans. Harry opens a letter, puts it down, and unties the string on the parcel, unfolding the silver wrapping paper to reveal some soft material with a rich dark pattern, which he swings onto his shoulders, and his head begins to float. In the library, a floating hand carries a lantern between the bookshelves as Harry, under the invisibility cloak, peers about him wearily. Inside, he searches along more dark bookshelves, takes off the cloak, and holds the lantern closer to a shelf, then puts the light down. As he takes down a book and opens it, a screaming face bursts violently out of the pages, prompting Harry to slam the book shut. Grabbing his cloak, he knocks over the lamp, quickly puts on the invisibility cloak over his head, and disappears as Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern, the lamplight showing up his thin lips. Hidden by the invisibility cloak, Harry feels his way across the dark room, stopping for a moment as Filch passes by with his lantern, and breathes a sigh of relief as the caretaker goes out through a far doorway. Harry creeps into a moonlit corridor, where Filch's red-eyed cat is lurking, while still invisible. As the cat runs past, two professors, Snape and Quirrell, burst through a door, and suddenly suspicious, Snape turns around. Harry covers his mouth to muffle his breathing as Snape makes a grab but only snatches a handful of air. Harry takes a step backward as Snape turns sharply back to Quirrell, and then Quirrell, Snape, and Filch rush away down the corridor. A door in the far wall seems to open and close by itself.",
    "169": "Chili watches a woman on the sidewalk pause to tighten the scarf around her neck, then turns and studies Tommy for a moment before Tommy looks at him. As Chili gets up from the table, the other men around the table follow his lead as he finishes up some jokes. He merely watches in the glass as Tommy turns up his collar and steps out into the cold Miami day. A moment later, the manager, an old Italian guy in a black suit, joins him in the doorway, looks off-screen, and begins speaking in Italian. Chili stares straight ahead, rubs his hands together, and tries to stay warm. Tommy drives, and Chili points out the window. Tommy looks up at the hotel as Chili takes a pair of leather gloves from the top of the dash and opens the door. Tommy pulls up out front, and Chili knocks on the door three times; he waits, pulls the right-hand glove on tight, so that when Ray Bones opens the door, Chili nails him with one punch. Later, Chili and Tommy each sit in a barber chair, reading the newspaper, while Fred and Ed sit nearby playing checkers. A car pulls up, and Chili is no longer listening to Tommy but instead watching as Ray Bones and a Black Guy get out of the car. Ray Bones eyes Chili, then nods to Fred and Ed, while Tommy looks over as Ray Bones, with a smaller bandage on the top of his head, and his man enter the shop. The two guys leave as the Black Guy steps up to Chili, who exchanges a look with Tommy, watches as 'Mr. Bones' goes down the hall into the back office, then turns to the Black Guy. Ray Bones comes out with the collection book open, looking at all of the names of who owes what, stepping over to Chili. Ray Bones checks his man for some appreciation, but the guy is too busy looking at the hair rinses and other items on the counter. Tommy watches as the Black Guy picks up a pair of scissors, runs his hand along the edge, and Ray throws the book at Chili and walks out, his man right behind him. Ray Bones then nods to his man, who grabs Chili and holds the point of the scissors to Chili's throat. Chili looks over at Tommy. Finally, Chili sits with Fay Devoe, an attractive woman in her thirties wearing a sundress, on her patio. They each have a drink, and she looks at him, touching her drink to the side of her face as they sit there in silence for a moment. Fay reaches over, puts a hand on his leg, and Chili finishes his drink, setting it down. She finally looks at Chili.",
    "628": "Graham and his family look up and stare at something. Graham walks slowly across the polished wooden floor into the front hallway, reaching the door to the cupboard under the stairs and pulling it open. He looks at the TV set inside, which is displaying a test card. He turns to look back at the others and swallows. Later, Merrill is upstairs, hammering boards onto the door of the children's bedroom. Across the landing in his room, Graham cautiously approaches the window and looks out over the maize field. His eyes widen and become fixed in a fearful stare as he backs towards the bedroom door. Merrill looks over at him. Eyes still on the window, Graham sidles out of the room and closes the door. Graham lifts up a plank and holds it across the door, with Merrill taking the other end. Together, the two men hammer nails through the plank into the door frame, with Bo and Morgan standing at the top of the stairs behind them, watching. Turning to get another mail, Graham stops and stares at Bo before helping Merrill with another plank. Bo remains motionless, clinging to her brother, then walks over, and he crouches down. She shakes her head, Bo grins at him, and he strokes her cheek. Graham pulls her towards him and picks his daughter up. Merrill slaps another plank across the bedroom door. Bo in his arms, Graham and Morgan go downstairs into the front hallway. Graham and Merrill put the children down, and they stop and listen. They all stare in the direction of the barking beyond the wooden mantle piece, which stands at the far end of the room, with two China dogs sitting on it, one on each side, illuminated by the dim glow of two wall lamps above them. Graham's eyes dart nervously around, his fingers tightening on Bo's shoulders in front of him. He and Merrill exchange anxious glances. They look towards a boarded-up window to the right of the mantle piece, their gaze passing across the fireplace as they turn to follow the noises. Shadows flit across the slit of moonlight between two planks across the window on the left of the mantle piece. Slowly, the family turns to watch the figures block out the soft light diffusing through the gaps between the boards on another window at the front of the house. They swing around and stare petrified down the hallway and into the kitchen towards the back door. They turn quickly back around to look at the front door, one plank nailed across the frame halfway up, as the doorknob turns. Morgan starts to back away, and Graham looks around and puts a comforting hand on Morgan's shoulder before kneeling down in front of the frightened boy. Graham smiles lovingly as a tear falls from Morgan's eyes.",
    "657": "She leans forward, cups his face with her hands, and they kiss, a long, lingering kiss, as the rain continues to fall around them. She then places her fingertips on the roll of the mask and tugs it back into place. He shoots out a web and pulls himself up while she stands in the pouring rain, looking up into the sky with the broadest of grins. The next day is clear and bright, with the sun shining over the skyscrapers of Manhattan as fire trucks surround a burning apartment building, where flames roar out of the top floors and firemen evacuate the building's occupants. A woman runs to them while Spider-Man zooms along the streets, leaping from web to web above the traffic. Spider-Man swings from a lamp stand in front of the burning building and leaps through a window on the lowest floor, which is alight, disappearing from the view of those on the ground. A fireman, his face and outfit blackened, stands by the mother, whose hands are closed as if in prayer, as they all remain calm. Spider-Man reappears at the second explosion and lands on the sidewalk with a baby in his arms. The mother pulls back the shawl as a policeman races up and scrutinizes Spider-Man. Spider-Man hauls himself back up to the top of the building and bursts in through a window, looking around the blazing inferno as part of the ceiling caves in. He sees a figure in the distance and reaches out for it, but the figure spins round, revealing the Green Goblin, who delivers a punch that sends Spider-Man sprawling. The Goblin throws an orange ball that explodes into several spinning boomerang blades, which Spider-Man leaps acrobatically to avoid. As he jumps, ducks, and weaves, the Goblin attacks with his gloved fists, and Spider-Man fights back while deflecting the rotating blades, one of which cuts his left arm. In a nimble, darting move, Spider-Man arches his back to avoid another blade, whips back up, smashes the Goblin in the face, pulls him back with a webbed thread, and volleys him with his left foot through a partition. Using the explosion as cover, Spider-Man beats a hasty retreat as Norman's eyes glaze over on his way up to Harry's apartment, where Harry and Aunt May are tidying up, and MJ has a sniff of a casserole. They hear the elevator gate, and Aunt May opens the door while Spider-Man lands outside on his room's window ledge. Harry hears the sound as Norman eyes up MJ, and Aunt May calls upstairs. They're all gathered in the living room by the bottom of the stairs as Aunt May starts to make her way up, and he whips off his mask.",
    "615": "He waves to her daughters. A bearded man with long gray hair stands non-plussed as Sydney ponders. A beer bottle emerges over the railing of the bandstand, and drunk Sydney climbs onto the railing behind the band, addressing the crowd with his arms out. The guests resume their conversations as Sydney limps up to Alison, who sits alone in the half-light with a bottle of wine in her lap, gently rocking on a swing. He skulks off, then races back, gesticulating wildly, and Alison strides off tearfully, leaving a dumbstruck Sydney staring after her. She quickly returns and kicks it as he slumps down on the rope swing, then falls backward onto the grass. Shimmering lights play on the rippling surface of the swimming pool as Sydney lies on his belly by the water's edge. Sophie's reflection appears like a mirage on the water, and he rolls over to look up as she kneels down beside him, lies down beside him on her belly, rolls onto her back, and moves closer to him. She stares up at the stars, and Sydney bites his bottom lip. Smiling, she turns her head to look at Sydney, who lies on his side, gazing at her. Dappled by a pale shifting light, she looks back up at the stars, and Sydney springs to his feet and races off through the party. A man hands Sydney a small Ziploc bag of white powder, and Sydney runs off. Alison is bent over, drunkenly failing to unlock her car door, and holding Alison upright, Sydney gazes over at Sophie, who is kneeling by the pool. Sydney drives with Alison in the passenger seat, and they drive down a dark stretch of road as she presses her lips together, stifling tears, then vomits. Alison is slung over Sydney's shoulder as Sydney sits in his apartment with his bespectacled father and Mrs. Kowalski. Wearing Sydney's jacket, Alison puts a song on in his bedroom, and Mrs. Kowalski gives Alison a sideways look as she dances out to join them. The bag of white powder is present as Alison joins them on the sofa, covers her mouth, and balding, brown-suited Richard stands as Mrs. Kowalski leads Alison to Sydney's bedroom. Sydney washes up as his father returns a framed portrait photo of a woman to a shelf. Richard looks blank, sidles up behind Sydney at the sink, and goes to put a hand on Sydney's shoulder but can't bring himself to do it, turning away instead. Richard puts a copy of his book down on the table as Sydney stares solemnly at him, then reluctantly cracks a smile. Sydney opens the bedroom door, leans his head against the door frame, and peers into the dark room where Alison lies sleeping, smiling fondly as she stirs. Sydney's eyes dart left and right as he retreats from the room.",
    "1125": "He picks up the radio. Outside of the clearing, Hermione tip-toes towards the invisible, protective shield. Her eyes peeled, she gazes into the gloom. Narrowing her eyes, she peers towards the dark shadows under the trees. In the tent, Harry studies the Marauder's Map. Snape's footprints appear near the headmaster's study. Hermione continues to prowl. She freezes as men approach, one carrying a woman. He passes by. A second man follows with someone slung over his shoulder. A third stops, just past Hermione. He retraces his steps, until he stands directly in front of her. She stands stock still. He can see no sign of her, the tent, or the campfire. The second man drops the body from his shoulder. The man does as he's told. The three of them walk away. Harry joins Hermione. Hermione looks in the direction the men went. Her face is solemn. They walk towards the tent. Ron steps out of the tent. He sees the two of them together. He looks pale and haggard. As they journey through fields and past devastated homes, Ron grows more drawn and suspicious. They're camped under a bridge. Harry stands alone a little distance from them. Ron stays glued to the radio. Now, they're camped on the shore of a lake. At night, Ron lies awake. In the tent, Hermione is cutting Harry's hair. She stops suddenly. She consults a book. The light whisks away from the lamps. Hollow-eyed, Ron appears holding the deluminator. He returns the light. Harry lunges at him. The two friends glare at each other. Ron tugs off the locket and throws it down. Ron picks up his bag and scowls at Hermione. She looks distraught. She glances round at Harry, then back to Ron. She hesitates. Ron glowers at Harry. His mouth curled in a snarl, Ron storms out. Hermione follows. Harry paces uneasily. His face troubled, Harry remains alone inside the tent. Next morning, Harry steps out of the tent and sees Hermione standing by the water's edge, her back to him. She gazes anxiously across the wintry landscape. Harry waits as Hermione ties her scarf round a slender tree trunk. The locket dangles from her hand. She walks through dead bracken and stands beside Harry. He takes her hand. They apparate on a stony clifftop. Hermione sadly wipes her eyes. Harry moves away discreetly as she turns to hide her tears. High on the limestone clifftop, he creates a protective shield. Hermione sits huddled on a flat-topped rock. Harry stands alone, looking towards the setting sun. A dim light glows inside the tent. The wind ruffles Harry's hair as he walks over the rocks. He turns, hearing the faint sound of the radio.",
    "81": "We watch, for a moment more, the two sleeping faces and then find ourselves in Peacock Alley, a tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th-century remnant of the old river civilization, which general progress has left behind. They stroll barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk, eventually looking towards the voices; PEARL is friendly, but JOHN is hostile. Several stick their heads around the edge of the Schoolhouse door, chanting at the HARPER CHILDREN while another draws something on the wall next to the door. Over these lines, we briefly cut to -- chanting and drawing -- as the ARTIST completes in chalk a large simple sketch of a man hanging from gallows. As the verse ends, we see them looking towards the children; JOHN pays them no attention, taking PEARL'S hand. We shoot them through the window of MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S second-hand store, with the back of a watch silhouetted large in the foreground; JOHN'S eyes instantly fix on it, while the schoolchildren finish their song and vanish, giggling, into the schoolhouse. A watch with a moving sweep-hand ticks away. Over a shop-doorbell, we hear PEARL watching her; JOHN, the watch. He walks off fast as we dolly behind them; he leads PEARL, who hugs her doll, a few paces in silence until they come to the big window of Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor. WILLA's face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees them and waves them away, but he keeps her strolling. WALT SPOON comes out, proffering two lollipops. A short, lighted, toy-like train departs the town along the riverbank, whistling, and the whistle ties over the previous. A square, head-on shot features river water below and vibrant starlight above, highlighting a gas-lamp by the road, a tree, and pretty tree-shadows working across a window. PEARL lies in their bed, her doll snug on her shoulder, as JOHN sits on the edge of the bed in his underwear. He moves, and as his shadow moves away, the shadow of PREACHER is seen, motionless. PEARL sits up and points at it, causing JOHN to notice her and see it. We pan JOHN to the window, where he looks out and stands motionless before turning. We pan him back to bed while people wave from shore and boat. We pan her into frame at UNCLE BIRDIE STEPTOE'S toy-like little wharf-boat, which passes broadside, cutting to as the boat passes. BIRDIE'S head sticks through a porthole, showing he is a wiry old river character, and the boat whistles. As BIRDIE speaks, we pan JOHN and the foundered skiff into a two-shot before panning JOHN from the skiff to wharf and Birdie's door. JOHN enters and sits on a box as BIRDIE, in a ramshackle rocking chair, pours coffee and gives JOHN a cup.",
    "537": "The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David. The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought. The screen cuts to black and a title appears. The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building. The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes down the street. She walks further and further away; she turns a corner. Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise; the music stops. They begin to walk down the street. She shrugs. They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves. The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf. She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her. Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing. She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee. Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up. He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row.",
    "992": "The tug drifts, and somewhere ahead a U-boat surfaces in the darkness. Pleasant bangs on the wheelhouse window, and the tug restarts its engines, sending a plume of black smoke out of its funnel. Mike and Benjamin peer over the side and spot the U-boat's upper head as a U-boat blinds the whole surface. The tug's lights are visible on the horizon. Hurrying into the wheelhouse, the wheelman stares at Mike. Mike hands the wheelman a pistol, and a crew member mans a heavy machine gun on top of the tug while a gunner climbs into the conning tower. Benjamin has a life jacket, which he gives to one of the twins. The lights are turned off on the tug as Vic makes the sign of the cross. Manning the heavy machine gun, Danny Smith cocks the weapon, and the wheelman aims his pistol at the U-boat. Captain Mike grits his teeth, sets the engines full ahead, and steams towards the U-boat. The German gunner spots the tug approaching and opens fire with a machine gun. Benjamin ducks his face around as Danny returns fire. Mike flinches as the German rounds shatter the windows, and Pleasant, manning the searchlight, catches a bullet and collapses. Benjamin cowers on the deck below the wheelhouse, and Danny Smith is hit and falls from the machine gun. Mike also takes a hit and collapses. Vic crosses himself again as the tugboat plows forward and smashes into the side of the U-boat. The U-boat explodes beneath the tug, and both vessels take on water and begin to sink. Benjamin staggers into the wheelhouse and finds Mike on the floor. He props him up, and Mike screams in pain, tearing his jumper to reveal two bullet holes in his chest. Benjamin takes the captain's blood-soaked hand in his, and Mike dies. Benjamin stares down at him, his face stained with blood, as he stares at his lifeless skipper. Vic cradles his dead twin. A door swings open on the tug, which is listing badly in the water, and as dawn breaks, the tug and the U-boat have sunk below the waves. A fleet of other ships is now at the scene. Watched by a grieving Vic, Benjamin tosses a life belt from The Chelsea over the side of the rescue vessel. As it floats in the water, a hummingbird flies past it, then flies up and hovers briefly in front of Benjamin before flying off. The sun shines down out of a clear, blue sky. Benjamin, who now looks about 50, with shorter hair and new specs, wanders into the retirement home. She looks around and sees him, taking a few seconds to recognize him. He looks down, and Benjamin plays the piano.",
    "399": "She is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, and screaming. She takes in huge gobs of air and rubs her hand on his chest, sidling closer to him and coming on to him. Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips, allowing Jody to eat slowly. Fergus then pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth, and Jody eats the last bits. Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse, carrying a pot of tea and two cups. It is sweltering now in the greenhouse, and the hood is drenched with sweat. Jude comes into view, lays the tea on the ground, and his breathing becomes labored. Fergus gives her the gun, and Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves. Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap as Fergus enters. Maguire has a newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping. Jude drinks tea while looking at Jody sweating. Fergus re-enters and she goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off, and Jody looks up at him with his face bathed in sweat, breathing in mighty gulps of air. He smiles, and Fergus smiles back. Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips, drinks, and looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore, so Fergus goes back to his seat, drinks his tea, and fingers the gun on his lap. He looks at Fergus, and Fergus holds the gun to his face, fishing inside Jody's inside pocket. Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet containing credit cards and an army identification photograph. Fergus takes out a picture of Jody in cricket whites, smiling, and holding a bat, smiling again himself. Fergus then takes out another picture of Jody and a beautiful black woman smiling, and Jody chuckles. Fergus looks at him, keeping his gaze, and Jody smiles. Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him, and Jody walks toward it, breathing heavily while Fergus stands motionless in the dark, looking at him. Fergus turns him around, unzips his fly, and Jody takes two steps toward the wall. Fergus holds his hands from behind so Jody can lean forward, and Jody now pisses with immense relief, shakes his body, and steps back. Fergus leads him back toward the greenhouse and back to his chair, and Jody begins to laugh. Fergus also begins to laugh without knowing why, waking Maguire, who is walking out of the house at the sound of laughter. Jody continues to laugh until the hood is suddenly slammed back over his head. Maguire stands there in the dark, looking at Fergus, who gets up slowly and walks toward the door, while Maguire sits with an Armalite in his hands, watching him, as the sun comes up over the low hills around the farmhouse.",
    "1389": "Snape turns and sees Lupin standing in the shadows. Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions. Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map fiercely. Harry walks silently and lingers briefly in the doorway, absently eyeing the waxing moon that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn away but stops. Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his papers. As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her eyes. Stung, Hermione starts to reply but seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly, she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly out the doorway. Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry watches him go, along with the others, then spies Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand and starts to go, when the smoke within the crystal suddenly darkens. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then, a shadow crawls the glossy surface of the crystal, and a hand snatches Harry's shoulder. He wheels, finds, and Harry stiffens. When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon Harry's shoulder—her hand. Harry shakes his head. Clearly unsettled by his encounter with Trelawney, Harry hastens down the stairs, and we fade out. SWOOK! SWOOK! We fade up on a moving POV of a crow as it glides to the flock circling the feet of a pot-bellied man, the Executioner, sitting in the courtyard. As he sharpens his axe—SWOOK! SWOOK!—we cut to Harry, Ron, and Hermione hurrying past. The Executioner looks up, and we see Harry leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut. She and Ron look and see Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurking within a grouping of monolithic menhirs, binoculars in hand, spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch, tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when she turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. Hermione nods, then—SMACK!—quick as lightning, lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs, Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind. The trio makes their way down the slope and past Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction. Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and Ron sit, and the trio slips silently into a stand of trees. Beyond them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun. High in the clock tower, a bell begins to toll.",
    "1040": "The chase mounts a pedestrian area and crashes down a wide stone staircase, then rejoins the main road as other cars desperately veer to the side while Taylor powers onward. Barnes swerves to avoid a collision and mounts the pavement, wrestling with his steering wheel as Javier looks back and sees Barnes lose a little bit of ground. The chase continues as a fire engine bounds towards Taylor but holds while both Taylor and Barnes brake on the turn and then accelerate along parallel lines. Barnes drives through a pedestrian colonnade, spots two cars in the way, and brakes, being thrown around as the hatchback breaks through the gap. Taylor and Javier look behind them as they join a busy road and the chase weaves through a slow traffic. Javier pulls his gun, and Taylor clips another driver, who hits a parked car. Barnes powers through the flipping vehicles as Taylor looks back anxiously over his shoulder, and Javier lowers his gun, then leans out of the window and fires. Two bullet holes appear in Barnes' windscreen, and Javier sits back into the police car as Taylor looks in his rear view mirror and steers, then handbrake turns the police car round a corner and into the path of a truck which loses control. As Barnes rounds the corner, the truck smashes into the hatchback, causing pedestrians to scatter as Barnes is sandwiched between the truck and the nearby wall. Taylor smirks as they proceed along the underpass in the shadow of an elevated road, where Enrique steps from behind a pillar. Taylor stops the car, and Javier gets out, shooting the armed Enrique and then pointing his gun at Enrique's face while Howard films nearby and spots Anna crossing the road. Barnes pushes the windscreen out of the wrecked hatchback and climbs out onto the road as the truck driver holds his arms out, and Barnes pulls his gun, heading for the underpass. Veins stand out on Javier's forehead as he presses the gun up to Enrique's forehead while Barnes takes aim some way back. Javier spins and opens fire, and Barnes fires back as Taylor starts the police car, and they both land shoulder hits, with Javier grabbing the door of Taylor's car. Taylor pulls a gun and shoots Javier point blank as he accelerates, as Barnes gives chase on foot while Enrique dies by the roadside. A shot from Barnes shatters the back windscreen and hits Taylor in the shoulder, and Taylor looks dazed and loses control of the car, then veers onto the curb and crashes into a concrete ramp which smashes through the windscreen. Javier lies dead on the road with his face resting against his right arm as Barnes approaches the police car with his handgun held out in front of him.",
    "1161": "Harry staggers in with Dudley, who, about to be sick, points weakly at Harry as an owl hits the ceiling and falls in a flurry of feathers, then flies off. The envelope speaks, and Uncle Vernon smirks with glee. Under cover of darkness, the Dursleys smuggle Dudley into the car with a blanket over his head while Mrs. Figg watches from her window opposite and waves. In his bedroom, Harry thumps the wardrobe in anger and frustration, causing a photograph beside his owl's cage to fall onto the carpet, which he picks up, then sits on his bed to look at his parents dancing together in the moving photograph. He places it carefully on his bedside table beside a half-eaten plate of food. Cedric's face looms out of the darkness, sweating with fear, and Harry relives his terror as a flash of green light engulfs Cedric, who falls lifeless, followed by Voldemort's blank eyes staring out from his bony, snake-like skull, and Harry jerks awake to a streak of moonlight across his pillow. He lies as if in a trance, his lips moving, then turns his head as he hears a scraping sound. Still fully dressed, Harry reaches for his glasses and puts them on as he looks towards the door, where the key is slowly turning in the lock. Harry grabs his wand and sits up as the key continues to turn and falls to the floor. With a dazzling flash, the door flies open, revealing five people lit by a wand standing in the doorway, one of whom Harry recognizes. Moody leads them all outside, taps his stick, and a broomstick flies into each person's hand as Mrs. Figg watches them soar away high above Privet Drive. The twinkling lights of central London are spread out below as Kingsley, a wizard in African robes, flies in front, following the line of the River Thames as it winds through the city. They fly low, cloaks flying like a flight of huge bats skimming the surface of the shimmering water, swooping by HMS Belfast and heading upriver towards Westminster. Harry flies close beside Nymphadora Tonks as a pleasure boat on a nighttime cruise heads straight toward them, and Nymphadora steers to the right of it, with Harry to the left. They pass the flood-lit houses of Parliament, reflected in the water like a huge ocean liner, while a refuse lorry passes a garden in the middle of the London square. Moody leads them from the garden into the street, facing a terrace of Georgian houses, where he strikes the pavement, and one of the houses in front of them moves to the left, causing Harry's jaw to drop as an extra house slides into the space and balconies slot into position, with the people next door remaining oblivious as they continue watching television.",
    "47": "He stops, looks down at Lampert's body for a moment, then suddenly sneezes six times in rapid succession. He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it, and swallows it dry. He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit. He comes face to face with Grandpierre, stops, and turns to sit somewhere else. Again, the sound of the door opening interrupts them, and they turn to look. The figure of a man, outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness, wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie, and a bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string. He starts down the aisle toward the bier, camera leading him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at the others present, moving down the aisle. Grandpierre's face, then Gideon's, then Reggie's, and Sylvie's—all stare at the camera as Tex arrives. He stands staring at Lampert's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box. Sylvie points to Reggie, and unruffled, Tex starts over, addressing Reggie this time. She pulls out the letter and starts to read it. It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead, and the typed message reads. Sylvie has been reading over Reggie's shoulder. The elevator door closes on them, and Reggie reacts to this, starting down the hall, finally stopping at the door. The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk covered with its plastic shroud. Reggie enters, looks for somebody, and notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. Bartholomew comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale, grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years; sickly would be the word that describes him best—pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses that fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion. He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so. A small cubicle has a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk. A can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it. He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie. He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie. He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.",
    "1025": "Sadie lies at the foot of the bed and turns around as Charlotte touches her with slobbery fingers. Sadie hops out of bed and storms off down the hall, and Charlotte sits up to face her dad. Charlotte then jumps off the bed and scurries away, leaving a wide gap between her parents, while Debbie glances at Pete, yanks the bedspread toward her, and faces the TV as they both stare forward. Charlotte sits at her desk writing a note in red marker and hangs it on Sadie's door. Meanwhile, Pete wears headphones at his desk, while Sadie watches something on her tablet. Debbie now lies with Charlotte in her bed and leans over to kiss Charlotte on the lips. In the morning, Pete awakens on the couch in an awkward position, props himself up, and grips his shoulder. Pete then sips coffee at the island with his back to the table as his family eats breakfast, glancing back before eyeing his mug. He drives the kids to school, sloppily eats an egg sandwich, and sings, while Sadie eyes her father and looks away as Charlotte's eyes widen. At school, Charlotte puts on headphones as Pete walks her to class; they pass a gray-haired pregnant woman, and Pete stops to kiss his daughter on the head before starting to leave. A fat woman approaches with Joseph, who stands a dozen feet away and pokes her several times. In a coffee shop, Debbie sits with Jodi, grabs her phone, and Jodi narrows her eyes. In a school office, Debbie nods as Jill glares, Debbie shrugs, and Pete nods slowly. They exit the school with mischievous grins, each glancing at the other, avoiding eye contact, and enter the parking lot where Debbie heads to her silver SUV and Pete strolls to his blue Sedan, pulling keys from his pocket and briefly glancing toward her. They enter separate vehicles simultaneously. Later, at home, Pete and Charlotte sit at the table as Debbie serves chicken and looks at Pete, while Sadie storms away. Debbie then sits down, resting her head on her hand. In her room, Sadie does homework on her bed, as Charlotte's door slides open across their shared bathroom, and Charlotte emerges with an armful of things. She places Sadie's computer, phone, and tablet on Sadie's bed, and leaves as Sadie grabs her phone, smiles, and looks toward her younger sister as the door slides shut. Downstairs, Debbie sits on the couch while Pete paces, moves close, and they embrace. Finally, a main character, Jack, lies on the ground dying as a plane flies overhead.",
    "334": "The tall Bree folk loom over the nervous little hobbits as Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin make their way through the narrow streets, with tall buildings towering above them and lights glowing dimly from behind thick curtains. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin come rushing in as Frodo attracts the innkeeper's attention. Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar, while Sam indicates a brooding stranger who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long-stemmed pipe and peering from beneath a travel-stained cowl with gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur while sitting at the bar and chatting with locals. Frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar, grabbing Pippin's sleeve and spilling his beer. Frodo is then pushed into the hobbit's room by Strider, who sheathes his sword with a slight smile playing on his lips. The gatekeeper comes out of his lodgings with a lantern and a look of fear on his face, approaching the closed gate with great apprehension. As the gatekeeper peers out of his peephole, the gate crashes down on him as four Ringwraiths ride into Bree, flying down the empty streets like horsemen of the apocalypse. The front door flies open, and the four Ringwraiths rush into the Prancing Pony with wicked swords drawn, while Butterbur hides behind his bar, trembling and sweating in terror. Pippin stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep. The door creaks open, and the four Ringwraiths silently slide into the hobbit's room, looming above each bed and raising their shining swords above the sleeping hobbits. Sam's eyes open wide as, in unison, the Ringwraiths stab the hobbits in a slashing, hacking frenzy. The Ringwraiths step back from the slashed beds in triumph, but a hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow. The Ringwraiths shriek with rage as Sam sits up with a start, and another shredded pillow is revealed, causing more shrieks of rage. Pippin and Merry wake with a start, revealing that Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on Strider's bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the hobbits' room. Strider, Merry, Pippin, and Frodo march through a gloomy, overgrown forest as Frodo watches uneasily while Strider moves off into the cover of the trees, and Sam looks excited. Strider leads the hobbits through the gloom of the forest, then aerially leads Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin across the windswept moors. The hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks as Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam, stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it, and another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.",
    "911": "As Purvis struggles against the angry civilian, Winstead advances. Dillinger sees him just feet away gripping a pistol. Slack-jawed, Purvis relaxes his aim as Winstead lines up a shot. The bullet pierces the back of Dillinger's skull and exits through his cheek, spewing blood and tissue. Two crimson stains bloom on his shirt front, as Hurt fires twice from behind. Dillinger falls face down, eyes staring off, as blood streams from his ruptured cheek. Purvis stares, then ventures forward. As Dillinger lies dying, his lips move. Winstead removes his hat, crouches and leans his ear close to Dillinger. The agent narrows his eyes, glances at the fallen man, and withdraws, revealing Dillinger's lifeless stare. Winstead gets to his feet, his sober gaze locked on the dead man. He holsters his gun and Purvis joins his side. As the younger G-man eyes the body, Winstead dons his hat, his air stoic and grim. The older man faces him. Purvis eyes him long and steady. Winstead glances away, then looks Purvis in the eye. Marty leans in for a good look at Dillinger's body, then heads off. Polly averts her gaze. Purvis takes another look at the body. A dozen civilians from the movie house rubber-neck as they move closer to the scene. A few yards off, Anna glances over her shoulder and slips away. Before the growing crowd, a man lights a flare and holds it aloft. A few men swap grins and chat. The scene draws more Chicagoans from across the street, and more flares illuminate the area with searing light. The armed federal agents struggle to maintain order. Someone's hand blocks our view. A camera flashes over Dillinger's body. Winstead lights a cigarette and pensively looks away. More onlookers converge on the scene. Policemen help the agents manage pushy photographers. Purvis leaves the scene, silhouetted against the flares' sallow light. Behind him, the glow and the smoke fill the air, blotting the crowd from view. More civilians rush in. From overhead, we gaze down at the chaos, as we withdraw. Winstead sits at a table in a small room with white brick walls. In a cellblock, a matron escorts Billie. Clad in a simple gray dress, she wears a dull expression. As the matron ushers her to another, the prisoner maintains her dispassionate gaze. In the visiting room, the door opens. Winstead stands as Billie enters. She stares guardedly at him, then takes the seat facing his. Winstead sits. Leaning forward, he faces her with a knitted brow. Billie swallows, blinks her glistening eyes, then gives a stony nod. Billie glares coldly. Winstead opens a gold cigarette case and briefly thumbs the contents. He turns the case, offering the grieving woman a cigarette.",
    "1061": "She looks at him, shifting awkwardly, and David smiles but squirms at her discomfort, indicating that's a yes. Jenny smiles and pulls her nightie off her shoulders, and David heaves a sigh. Embarrassed, Jenny avoids eye contact, then David smiles, stands, and moves to her, pulling her nightie back on. He goes to kiss her but hugs her instead, and her arms remain by her sides until she puts them around him, and they hold one another. Sun shines on the small village as the Bristol pulls up at some old-timbered houses. Jenny stands completely aghast as the men walk away, and she and Helen walk through a cemetery, having slipped a picture in the back of the car. Jenny stops playing ball with some children and hurries over, where the picture, a map, is sitting between Jenny and Helen on the back seat. Jenny eyes him wearily as they later arrive at Danny's place. Jenny takes her bags and strides off, pausing at the cab without even looking at David, then stops angrily in the middle of the road and turns to him. He wanders over, wanting to explain, looks at her imploringly, then grins, and she can't help but grin back. He takes all of her bags, she makes a show of pulling away, but then he takes her hand and twirls her around, and they hug and slow dance in the street. On a colonnaded balcony, Danny holds up two glasses. At night, the Bristol arrives back at Jenny's house, and Jenny sits glumly in the passenger seat while David looks across at her. Wearing a tight smile, she doesn't look at him, but he smiles lovingly at her and looks down. Very slowly, they lean together and kiss, but she pulls away, and they smile, then sit awkwardly. Jenny puts her handbag on the kitchen table and shows it to her father. Marjorie stops her cake baking and goes to look at the book, while Jenny licks cake mixture off the whisk and grins to herself. At school, the girls, in their PE kits, get out for a run, but Jenny and her friends hide behind a tree smoking until the teacher arrives, prompting the girls to file out of the classroom, and Tina sticks her tongue out. Jenny enters the head's wood-paneled office, and the headmistress watches Jenny leave. At home, the dining room is in darkness as Graham has come for tea, and Jenny closes her eyes while Marjorie puts the candle-decked cake down in front of her. Jack switches the lights back on, and Marjorie drops Graham's slice of cake. Jenny unwraps the present and tries to look pleased as she shows Graham, accepting the gift with a tight smile and placing it on top of the other one. Jack gets up to answer the door, and David is laden with presents.",
    "932": "Holmes spots a bit of material, a piece of bloodstained wood, a dollop of mortar, and a stain. In his mind's eye, he sees mortar being churned and some spilt. A carpenter cuts his finger, spilling blood. Sacks are used as counterweights and a door handle is disguised as a coat peg. A mechanism turns. The workmen open a bottle of wine and some is spilled, staining the floor. Holmes eyes the coat pegs. He pulls on one of the coat pegs and a secret door opens. Watson draws a sword from a stick and cuts the rope holding the sandbag. The door swings shut behind them. Holmes lights a flaming brand. They look around the secret room and see a printing press and, on a table, sticks of dynamite. Holmes eyes a plaque reading, Imperata. Leading the way with his flaming torch, Holmes heads off down a dark corridor. They go up a flight of stone steps, push a metal grill open, and emerge on a dark street beneath a bridge. They climb up onto the bridge and look out towards the opera house. As they get close to the building, they push their way through crowds outside. Inside, the performance is underway. Sim, Holmes, and Watson enter the opera house through the stage door. As they make their way backstage, they don't notice Moriarty's agent lurking in the shadows. He gets up and, puffing on a dark cigarette, watches them go by before heading off in the opposite direction. Holmes, Watson, and Sim walk past stagehands in the wings. A couple of them try to stop them but they ignore the men's protests. Holmes spots a plaque, Imperata, and thinks back to the dynamite beside the one in the secret room. He imagines a bomb with a timing device beneath the stage. Holmes walks over to one of the stagehands and flings him out of the way. He gestures to Sim, who tosses him a knife. Holmes climbs under the stage and cuts a hole in a sheet of canvas. He looks up and sees the word Imperata is part of the print on which the statue of Commendatore is standing. Holmes is now inside the plinth. Onstage, the Commendatore points a finger at. Holmes peels away a backing cloth from the word Imperata. Inside the plinth, he finds a black chess piece concealed in the O. He picks the chess piece up and sees Moriarty sitting in a box, watching the performance and possibly him, through a pair of opera glasses. Holmes rips his way out of the back of the statue of the Commendatore and hurries across the stage to the wings where Sim and Watson are waiting beside a couple of actors in demon costumes.",
    "1205": "Lights burn in the house at night, and he's lying by the fire. He lies down next to Marley as Jenny fetches a blanket for them. Marley is lying under a tree, and he gets out of the car and runs indoors, where Connor gives him a hug. Jenny fights back tears while John takes the stuffed lamb, and Patrick tearfully hugs Marley. The boy looks imploringly at his parents; Jenny frowns in sympathy at her son's pain, and John tries a reassuring smile. He carries Marley out to the car and gently lays the old dog down in the boot. John goes to get behind the wheel as Jenny tearfully strokes her dying pet; she closes the door and presses her hand to the glass as John drives away down the winding drive through trees adorned with golden brown autumn leaves. At the surgery, John sits and waits with his hands clasped together. At home, Patrick is leafing through John's old columns, and Jenny walks in and ruffles his blonde hair. Jenny controls her own emotions as John gives into tears. He goes back into the surgery where Marley is lying on the table, runs his hand down Marley's beige coat, and strokes the dog's tail, which isn't wagging now. John holds a rear paw, rubs Marley's shoulder, leans forward, and hugs his friend, burying his face in Marley's neck, then gently strokes Marley's head. Jenny waits tearfully at home as the vet puts a hypodermic into the IV line going into Marley's leg. Patrick slots a videotape into a player, and Jenny waves to the camera holding baby Patrick in a cowboy outfit. Marley stands expectantly next to the high chair, and Jenny slips him a tidbit. Patrick stares at the TV while at the surgery, the vet pushes down the plunger on the needle. John watches Marley, and Jenny sits sadly, staring into space. On the video, John takes off Patrick's nappy, which Marley then grabs, and Patrick grins, watching as his father tries to wrestle the nappy off the dog. Jenny sits sadly in the window seat as Patrick concentrates on the old video footage of his mother laughing and a close-up of Marley, staring puzzled into the camera. The vet puts a stethoscope to Marley's chest and listens; John continues to stroke Marley's head as the vet takes off the stethoscope and turns away. The Grogans walk across their leaf-strewn lawn, John carrying Colleen on his shoulders. He lifts down the little girl as they reach a small grave by a tree; she puts the picture in the grave, and he puts his paper in with Colleen's. She takes off her necklace, kneels down next to the grave, and drops the necklace in with Marley.",
    "487": "A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat, and a hand comes into the shot holding an enormous bread knife. Over it, the brief gulps of screaming can be heard, followed by the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. Above the shower-bar, the bathroom door opens again, and after a moment, the sound of the front door slamming is heard. Lying half in, half out of the tub, her head is tumbled over, touching the floor with her hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, and one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. Coming down the side of the tub, many small threads of blood run thick and dark along the porcelain. The camera follows away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, and out into the bedroom. As the camera approaches the bed, the folded newspaper is seen as Mary placed it on the bedside table beside the bed. The camera moves over to the window and looks up at the house, and as it gets there, Norman's fearful, shocked voice is heard coming from within the house. She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls. Bob gets the message and goes out through the back way. Sam goes closer to Lila, speaking with soft seriousness. Arbogast studies it, then speaks, nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens the door, and goes out into the street. Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in. Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, and studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door. He waits a moment, then opens the closet, starts counting out sheets and pillowcases, keeping his back to Arbogast. Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he crosses to Norman. Norman glances briefly, turns away, and lifts sheets and pillowcases off the shelf, holding them close, almost protectively. He goes to the wall, flips a light switch, takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, and lays it beside the signature in the registry book, nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him. Arbogast has reached him, picture extended, and Norman looks dutifully at it. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts towards Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful. Arbogast turns and gazes seriously at him. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch.",
    "611": "He enters reception and collides with an immovable turnstile, then staggers round. Attractive women dwarf him in an elevator, and a petite brunette in a gray suit leads him into a spacious office. A be-suited man with shoulder-length silver hair stands at a window staring out over the city, and Clayton Harding turns to look at him. Sidney reaches into his shoulder bag and proffers a red tee-shirt, which Clayton slings out of an open window. A post-modern review depicts Clayton as a nude king, and Sidney's smile fades as he meets with an indifferent stare. Clayton leaps through the offending issue, and Doc suited Lawrence leads him into a private office. Sidney glances at his bright red tee-shirt and fidgets before pointing at a photograph on the wall. It's the woman whose drink he spilled in the bar. In an open-plan office, Sidney crosses to Alison and perches on her desk while she works at a computer. A co-worker in a polka dot dress frowns. With a phone to his ear, Sidney pulls over a sheet of printed photographic negatives and adjusts his specs. She hangs up, the corners of his mouth downturned, as he peers at the contact sheet through a magnifying eye-glass to see two portly middle-aged gentlemen holding glasses of wine. He hits redial, looks at the telephone receiver, and frowns. Munching a hamburger, Sidney enters the lobby through a revolving door, joined by a blond in an A-line dress. As the door starts to close, she reaches out towards a hastily approaching colleague and quickly retracts her hand as the door slams shut, narrowing her eyes disapprovingly. It starts its descent, and the doors open. She strides out in a huff to Alison, who is wearing a sharp suit, and ignoring Sidney, she opens a book and starts to read. Tight-lipped, she stares down at her book, while Alison lowers her eyes as a golden-haired woman in her mid-40s wearing expensive sunglasses steps into the lift and turns her back on them. Sidney goes to swallow a mouthful of burger but gags, and a glob of chewed burger shoots out of his mouth and lands with a splat on the back of the woman's cream jacket. As Sidney goes to wipe it off, an incredulous Alison grabs his wrist and shakes her head; Sidney and Alison hurry out, and he takes a bite of the burger. Sidney rolls his eyes as he listens in. Night falls, and Sidney gazes out through the window of a sleek black automobile as it glides through Manhattan. Alison and Lawrence seem indifferent, thumbing their mobile phones. He looks out on the gaudy lights of Times Square, turns to his colleagues, and they eyeball him, then look back at their phones.",
    "249": "She touches its sleeve, and her hand goes into its pocket, pulling out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper, imitating what he did earlier, licks the paper, and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Her hand reaches back into the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She slaps the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did, and what do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then loudly snaps the Zippo closed. The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket, but wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face. Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line. Her head jerks back, and her hands go to her nose, which feels like it's on fire; something is terribly wrong. Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror. Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose, then her stomach gets into the act and she vomits. Vince continues as blood and puke are down her front and her face is contorted, slack-jawed. Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone. Jody, his wife, calls from the bedroom, obviously woken up. Lance charges from the window out the door to his front lawn, and Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out. We start in Lance's and Jody's bedroom as Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up, wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. As she walks into the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room. From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a documentary in an emergency ward, with the big difference being nobody knows what they're doing. Lance looks up at Jody, and we follow Lance as he runs out of the living room into a room with a bunch of junk in it.",
    "583": "Trina smiles and looks at the passengers from her jump seat. Whip takes the phone. Nicole gets out of the car and runs up to the second floor of a small run-down apartment complex. She pulls out a key as she reaches the door, only to discover it is slightly open. She smiles at him. He stands in the doorway. She kicks the door closed. She flings her bag on a table, and it hits a box which falls and scatters its contents. She spots a syringe. Whip speaks into the intercom. He pours the contents of a small vodka bottle into a juice container hidden from the passengers' view. He tosses three miniature bottles as he grabs the spiked orange juice. He takes a long drink as Margaret exits the toilet and he goes in. In Nicole's apartment, framed photographs on the table show a younger, smiling Nicole with her mother. Nicole lightly taps the syringe. Then pushes out a small drop that slides down the needle. She tightens a tourniquet around her arm and holds the end securely in her mouth. She positions the needle and injects. Her arms relax and she lets go of the syringe. She leans back, eyes closed. The strap falls from her mouth. Her head lulls to her shoulder. Her dilated pupils shrink to tiny dots. She grabs the packet of cocaine that Kip gave her and falls on her side. The packet falls inches from her hand. Her fingers reach out, but only push it away. Her hand goes still as feet appear under the door. In the cockpit, Whip sleeps with paper covering his eyes and his sunglasses over the paper. Ken's yoke jerks away. The yoke slips out of Ken's hands as Whip struggles to gain control and the plane begins to dive. The wheels of the aircraft unfold. In the galley, Margaret grabs the phone. Margaret unbuckles her seat belt. Alarmed passengers grasp the seat in front of them as a flight attendant tries to assist someone. Cammie falls and hits her head. Cammie lies still. Whip banks to the left. The plane turns upside down. She slides the side-stick forward. One wheel gets stuck while retracting. Inside the cabin, Cammie comes to a rest on the ceiling. Trina sees a young boy slip out of his seat. Outside Georgian Gardens, a medical aide wheels Nicole beside Fran as the upside down plane flies past. Trina crawls to the boy and straps him back in his seat. A light flashes on the control panel in the cockpit. The plane turns upright, and the still-unconscious Cammie falls on some passengers. Trina loses her hold and falls against the bulkhead. Fire and smoke billow from the left engine.",
    "494": "Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow and then chuckles, while Cole's face turns cement grey. Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering as Cole glances up and sees all the eyes on him. He glances at the teacher, who is still staring, and Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face, instantly stopping smiling as his face becomes still. The class falls into stunned silence. Mr. Cunningham takes an involuntary step towards Cole's desk and moves closer to Cole, who covers his eyes with his hands. Cole's mouth is visible under his covered eyes as he stares for a second and then lowers his head. Malcolm just sits and thinks as Cole turns his head and stares at the windows. Malcolm takes in the sad vision of the boy, and Cole's face softens a bit. Cole turns from the windows and looks to Malcolm, placing it in his right hand, as Malcolm shakes his hand in circles. Cole watches his hand carefully, and Malcolm taps the pocket but doesn't open it. Malcolm opens his right hand, and the penny sits quietly in the center of his palm. Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face, cracking a smile. Cole smiles and holds out his hand, his fingers opening to reveal the penny, while Bobby stares. Cole loses his smile, and Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other. Cole gives the boy his penny and gazes at Bobby. Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen, staring at the crawl space closet, and grabs Darren, nudging him to move down the hall. Cole breaks from his trance as Tommy and Darren walk up, but it happens too quick for Cole to react, as Darren and Tommy shove him backwards, and he stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space as Tommy slams the door closed. They crack smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door, the banging going on for a few seconds, and then it just stops. Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl space door, backing away as Cole screams in terror at the top of his lungs, his body slamming against the wood. The two boys are statues as Cole's blood-chilling yells fill the air, footsteps spiking the air as children and mothers come running down the hall, with Lynn being one of them. Malcolm is affected by his client and stares at the tired child sitting before him in the hospital bed, slowly moving the rolling chair closer to Cole’s bed. Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole, who watches him with unwavering attention, as Malcolm smiles. Cole takes an eternal pause while Malcolm just gazes quietly, being very still and staring back at Cole.",
    "1169": "The owl takes wing and swoops low along the misty road. As it glides silently away through the trees, an upright elderly gentleman appears out of the shadows. He has a flowing white beard and long, silky white hair, and wears a pointed black hat. A plump tabby cat sitting on a wall turns its head curiously. The old gentleman walks along the pavement and stops beneath a street light. In his hand, he holds a small metal object which he flicks open. He raises the metal object and points it at a street lamp. The light from the lamp flies towards his hand and the lamp goes out. The light from the second street lamp disappears, and then a third. When all the lights in the road have been extinguished, the old gentleman lowers the metal object and flicks it shut. He looks over the top of his half-moon glasses at the plump tabby cat. The cat gives a hiccup, and its shadow looms large against the wall. It turns into a stern-looking woman wearing a cloak and a tall pointed black hat with a large brim. A bright light appears in the sky above the treetops, the lights of a motorcycle. Coattails flying, Hagrid, a huge giant, zooms down and screeches to a halt. Twinkling eyes peer out below dark bushy eyebrows. He has a huge black beard. He hands over a small bundle wrapped in a warm blanket. As Professor Dumbledore gently places the bundle on a doorstep, a tear runs down Hagrid's cheek. The tiny baby has a jacket scar on his forehead. A boy with a jacket scar on his forehead lies fast asleep. In the cupboard under the stairs, Harry Potter wakes and puts on a pair of large round spectacles mended with sticky tape. A pudgy boy crashes down the stairs. A shadow of dust falls on Harry. The pudgy boy rushes into the kitchen. Harry comes in. Dudley stares at the huge pile of birthday presents. Dudley and his mother get into the car with a big bag of sweets. Uncle Vernon wags his car key in Harry's face. In the Reptile House at the zoo, Dudley stares at the sleeping python. Vernon bangs on the glass. Harry looks at the snake sympathetically. The python lifts its head and winks. It flicks its tongue and nods. It shakes its head. Dudley knocks Harry aside. Suddenly, the glass partition disappears. Dudley tumbles over the rail. He falls headfirst into the pond inside the snake's enclosure. Dudley sits spluttering in the pond, as the snake slithers over the wooden rail and down onto the floor beside Harry. The python raises its head and stares straight at him.",
    "619": "The locker door is plastered with photos and cuttings. She pulls out a folder and some pages fall to the floor as a boy comes by. Juno grins at her friend talking to a fat bearded teacher. In class, Bleeker swallows some Tic Tacs as Juno appears by his side clutching her folders. Another boy stands on the other side of the work table. A second girl turns up. Amanda leaves Josh open-mouthed. Bleeker suppresses a smile. Later, Juno dials a number. She vigorously shakes the phone and something falls out. She frowns at the phone. Juno throws up in a decorative urn. Juno's little sister sprinkles her food. Liberty Bell smiles slowly. Juno plods away past Su-Chin. Juno stops in her tracks. She shrugs and walks on towards the door of the Women Now Center. A punk girl sits in reception playing on her game console. Juno wanders into the lobby and steps up to the counter. Juno nods obediently. Juno takes the questionnaire clipboard to a padded leather bench and sits down. As she starts to fill in the form, she becomes aware of a black woman seated nearby crumbing her fingers against her clipboard. A woman painting her nails, another scratching her arm, another using a nail file add to the crescendo of sound. Juno drops her pen. Su-Chin brightens. They sit on a park bench scouring the paper. Leah hands pipe-smoking Juno an ad. Bleeker is lying on his bed, looking at the photo of Juno in his yearbook. His other hand is clasped around a piece of cloth. Bleeker's solidly built double-chinned mother closes the door of his bedroom. He goes back to gazing at Juno's picture and brings his class pen from behind his head. Scrunched in his fingers, he's holding the knickers she wore and discarded on the day they had sex. At Juno's house, Leah watches apprehensively as Juno paces in front of her dad and her stepmom. Mac and Bren brace themselves. Juno looks them both in the eye. Leah pulls a face. Juno meets her dad's bewildered gaze, then lets her head drop for a second before speaking. Mac shakes his head as she turns on her heels and hightails upstairs with Leah behind her. He runs his hands over his face. A slim young woman arranges some white hydrangeas in a glass vase. White cuffed hands straighten a glass photo frame. She places some aromatic sticks into a bottle. Mac with Juno beside him drives his blue Previa through the gates of the affluent looking Glacial Valley estate. With a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, she fans out the display of coffee table magazines, straightens two monogram tan towels, and wipes a banister rail as Mac drives past a number of substantial houses set back from the road.",
    "1375": "The crowds are cheering, and people are taking bets as Harry paces nervously. Hermione stands by the tent door, whispering in before entering the tent, where they hug. A bright camera flashes as journalist Rita Skeeter approaches, but she soon leaves as Dumbledore enters. The champions gather around Dumbledore in a circle as Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon from the bag, followed by Viktor, Cedric, and finally Harry, who pulls out the dragon. The cannon fires immediately, and Harry sits alone nervously before entering the rocky arena. The crowd cheers his name as he sees the golden egg sitting alone, making a run for it, but a dragon appears, forcing him to retreat behind a rock as it flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena before summoning a broom. He jumps on and flies off, chased by the dragon, which bursts through the crowd, leaving them stunned. Harry flies at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings before getting cut off by the dragon, which whips him off his broom, causing him to land on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon clambers across the roof, strewing tiles until Harry reaches his broom, jerks it loose, and lets go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him. Falling a long way, Harry regains control and flies to an area with a bridge, flying through a gap as the dragon crashes into it and falls into the water. The crowds are mostly silent until Harry flies towards them, causing the crowd to erupt as he goes straight for the golden egg. Harry lifts the golden egg, surrounded by cheering people, and the Weasley twins have him on their shoulders. Seamus hands Harry the golden egg as Ron appears in the doorway. Harry looks at Cho, but when she looks back, he spills drink from his mouth, leading to laughter. A young boy named Nigel walks up holding a package, gazing at Harry before leaving. Hermione laughs as groans emerge from the boys listening on, while the girls seem more excited. A girl grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance, leading to a wolf whistle from the crowd. Girls instantly stand and walk forward as boys remain seated, with Neville eventually standing. Groups of girls give icy looks and turn their backs as Hagrid and Madame Maxime walk and laugh together, sharing a moment. Viktor Krum trains while a group of girls follows him around, and Severus Snape walks past, slapping Ron over the head.",
    "973": "Inside, he crosses a huge marble lobby striped with shadows, then plods up a dark staircase. Later, he stands before double doors marked Mr. Donaldson. As he goes to knock, the clean-cut Donaldson steps out. They enter a wood-paneled room through a door framed in green marble. The wall suggests an octagonal perimeter. They enter a records archive. They stop by a reference desk. The balding Burdensky opens a volume. On the opened historical pages, the circuit light pathways are unchanging. Meanwhile, David and Elise walk together. As they stroll through a park in the early evening, Elise throws her head back and laughs. Now, in the Adjustment Bureau reading room, Richardson finds Harry studying at one of the large tables. Back in the records room. With David and Elise. He runs. He easily stays ahead, running backward. She gut-punches him and runs ahead. She wins. Now ravers dance under bright flashing lights in a warehouse. David and Elise enter. David waves at partygoers. Elise loosens, then removes it. Later at a table, David swigs from a beer bottle. He shakes a guy's hand. As David and Elise talk, their faces close together, David grins. Elise jumps up and down, pumping her hands around his head. The ravers cheer as David dances with Elise. Later, she hugs him. Now they leave the party. Elise watches him with sorrowful eyes. He twitches a tender smile. He glances away, and Elise gently rests a hand on his jacket lapel. As he gives her a sheepish grin, she reaches up to his face and strokes his cheek. Wrapping an arm around his shoulders, she leans forward and presses her lips to his. David returns the kiss, enveloping Elise in his arms. Later, in Elise's bedroom, David runs his fingers through her hair. She rests her hands on his bare back, and he clasps her face as he kisses her passionately. Now he rolls on top of her in bed, his lips still pressed to hers. As they make love, he grips her hand and their fingers intertwine. David nuzzles Elise's chest. She runs a hand up the back of his neck, and he lifts his head briefly. Later, he spoons her as they sleep, his arm draped over her body. A withdrawing view of them reveals a suited man in a fedora, standing at the foot of the bed. With steely eyes, he watches the couple sleep, then turns away. Sunlight seeps between clouds and fills the sky. Elise sleeps alone in bed, the sheets beside her pushed down and rumpled. She jerks awake. Her startled look becomes relieved, and she touches her fingers to her brow. She notices the vacant spot beside her and sits up.",
    "46": "He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head. As the sheet starts to lift, she closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again. She nods. She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the shot. GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen attendant. The camera suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. Blackness comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies. A close shot of a desk drawer from above as it is pulled open reveals a photograph of Charles Lampert lying face up in the drawer. The scene includes GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE sitting across from him, in an office as bare as most policemen's offices. She starts to rummage through her bag, but she pulls a package of nuts out, begins separating the shells with her thumbnail, eating the nuts, and depositing the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an instant. GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil, and pushes a button on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it into his mouth, then rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into the drawer, closing it fiercely. The door opens and a policeman enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket, which he deposits on GRANDPIERRE's desk, then leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into the basket, begins to take the items out, placing them on the desk, identifying each as he does. GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as she reads it. He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks. He reaches into the desk drawer, pulls out a passport, which he hands to her; the cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it to a picture of a man—the man seen in GRANDPIERRE's photo. He hands her another passport, the cover is American. He hands her, one at a time, two more passports, his eyes still lowered. The camera pans down to feature his hands—he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper. The front door of the chapel is heard opening, and a shaft of daylight streams in. The short, heavy-set figure of a man is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird, then walks down one of the side aisles of the chapel as he watches GIDEON, as she watches him, and GIDEON arrives at the coffin.",
    "732": "Rose gulps as she stares at the comb, and Brock kneels beside her before Rose nods. Later, a computer animation shows the Titanic striking an iceberg. Lizzie stands behind her grandmother as Rose climbs out of her wheelchair, and the crew watches her shuffle to a video monitor displaying footage of the Titanic wreck. Rose blinks and inhales sharply as the door with the ornate, leaded glass window comes into view, while in a flashback, two men in tuxedos smile and nod as they open a pair of doors with leaded glass windows. On the video monitor, grayish growth covers the window's ornate scrollwork, and Rose places her hands over her mouth before turning away from the monitor and returning to her wheelchair. Brock switches on a tape recorder as he sits across from Rose and grins, then nods. On a video monitor behind Rose, the corroded Titanic wreck transforms into a gleaming ocean liner moored alongside a dock as passengers walk up one of three gangplanks. Men and women toting suitcases make their way to the Titanic, and a crane loads an antique car onto the ship. Sitting in her father's arms, a young brunette girl watches a fleet of gleaming automobiles arrive, and a chauffeur wearing a tweed uniform and black leather gloves steps out of the driver's seat to open the car's back door. He takes a woman's gloved hand as she steps out of the car, and the brown-haired woman, wearing a white dress with thin black stripes and a large brimmed hat, gazes up at the enormous ship. A black-haired man in a bowler hat and grey suit steps out behind her and hands over money before checking his pocket watch and stepping to Rose and her mother as Rose follows her fiancee, Cal Hockley, through the crowd. A health inspector runs a comb through a man's dark hair and beard as Ruth strides ahead of Rose and Cal up the gangplank. Inside a saloon with a view of the Titanic, men smoke and drink while playing a game of cards. A brown-haired card player turns to a man beside him, and blonde-haired Jack deals Sven another card before exchanging one of his own for a card from the deck. Jack, eyes narrowed, smokes a cigarette as he peers across the table at Sven's partner with several silver coins, a pocketknife, a pocket watch, and a pair of third class tickets for the Titanic in the middle of the table. A black-haired man raps his knuckles on the table as Sven lays down his cards, and Fabrizio snatches the tickets and dances while Jack sweeps up the coins. Olaf grabs Jack's collar, and Jack closes his eyes as Olaf makes a fist but punches Sven instead.",
    "271": "Florence sits reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care in a living room dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan and Florence, gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece. From somewhere upstairs, an infant starts to cry, causing Florence to stop reading and look up at the ceiling, while Nathan is oblivious. The baby stops crying, and Florence's attention returns to her book. As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch, a third title is supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m. He starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an afterthought, and as he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear. Another baby starts crying, making Florence look up at the ceiling again. A close-up on the crying baby shows Hi bouncing it gently but desperately. The babies sound restless. A floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward the camera in the foreground, while another baby is rounding the open door from the nursery, making a mad dash for freedom in the background. Hi emerges from the nursery, stepping around the background baby and trotting toward the baby in the foreground. By the time he reaches it, the low-angle cropping shows us only his feet and calves, along with the baby and the stairway down to the main floor. He scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the nursery. The baby is at the nursery door in the foreground with the staircase in the background. As Hi reaches the baby, footsteps are heard climbing the stairs. Hi's free arm scoops the baby up and out of frame just as Florence's head appears, bobbing up as she climbs the stairs. She approaches the nursery, still clutching the Dr. Spock book. As Florence enters from the hallway door, she tracks back into the room and approaches the crib. Halfway there she freezes, staring in shock. ED's POV reveals Hi approaching the car, shrugging and displaying manifestly empty hands. Hi appears at the driver's window, reaching to open the door, but Ed slaps his hand away from the handle. He tries to open the door, which Ed is holding shut with all her might, rolling up the window and locking the door. Through the closed window, a muffled, very forlorn voice can be heard. Florence is holding one of the babies cradled against her shoulder, with the baby peeping out over her shoulder, facing the window, looking. Hi's head appears in the window, looking back as he holds a finger to his lips. Florence starts bouncing the baby, patting it on the back, and Hi and the window bounce up and down.",
    "904": "He pops off his cuffs, pulls out a Tommy gun, and bashes the guard as the officer points his own shotgun through the barred door. A guard quickly opens it, and they barge in just as the escapees force their captives into the room. As the guards strip, Dillinger shakes hands with the older inmate and unlocks the steel door. The stocky escapee faces a guard, and as Dillinger opens the door, the impersonating officer steps outside. Dillinger shuts the door behind him, and outside, Red leaves the metal gate behind and crosses the open ground towards the sedan, glancing back to the lookout turret. Inside, Dillinger waits with his Tommy gun as the gang continues to dress, and one guard faces the stocky inmate who smashes the defiant law man with his pipe. A guard reaches for the younger inmate's gun, and the younger inmate shoots him, capturing the rest of the room's attention. Outside, Red walks backward 20 yards from the gate while inside, the criminals run out, leaving their hostages behind. On the lookout turret, guards take aim as Dillinger crosses through the metal gate, followed by his now partially dressed gang. As the escapees race past him, Dillinger faces the entrance and fires his Tommy gun up at the watch tower. One escapee gets shot despite a barrage of gunfire from Dillinger and his armed cohorts. Walter hurries from the gate, still limping, and his sandy haired accomplice helps him along and fires back at the tower. Inside the turret, a guard goes down. As Walter reaches the getaway car, another guard fires a rifle, and shot in the back, Walter collapses. Standing on the running board, Dillinger grabs his arm as they drive away. His body dragging across the dirt, Walter hangs onto Dillinger's arm, grimacing in pain while Dillinger struggles to keep his grip while holding onto the moving car himself. Walter looks up to his old friend and grins, then his hardened face goes blank. His grip on Dillinger's forearm gives way, and the gang leader lets him go. Walter's body slides to a stop in the dirt as the car drives off, leaving a cloud of dust behind. Dillinger lingers for a moment and climbs into the back of the moving sedan. As the sandy haired escapee shuts the door, Dillinger puts a handgun to Shouse's neck. Red drives, sitting next to the younger escapee, and Dillinger lowers his handgun and punches Shouse in the face a couple of times. He opens the car door and throws him out of the moving vehicle, and Shouse lands on the side of the road, face down in the grass. Dillinger closes the sedan's door and sits back in his seat next to the sandy-haired Pete.",
    "418": "Eddie leaves the car parked at the gas station and heads for the bar. Armstead's is a typical small-town pool hall with a bar, a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables for small, friendly games. The few people in Armstead's this day are not playing; they sit and read the papers. Charlie and Eddie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon. Charlie rises from his barstool, and Eddie is already at the table. Charlie joins Eddie as the game is in mid-progress, and it's Eddie's shot. He downs his bourbon, weaves a bit, bends over the table, and awkwardly pokes at the white cue ball with his stick, missing an easy shot. Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play. The bartender refills the glasses as soon as they are emptied. Two balls lay side by side on the table. Eddie peers at them, trying to figure his shot, blinking his eyes to focus better. Some of the onlookers seem skeptical, but Eddie pats the corner pocket confidently, leans over, and raps out his shot. The ball banks in, and he pounds his pal Charlie on the shoulder and collapses into a nearby chair. Stung, Eddie lies across the table and sets them up himself. They toss their money on the table, and Eddie shoots, but his shot is too hard and his ball leaps over the side of the table. The bartender cannot contain his staccato laughter. Eddie pauses, smiling. Sheepishly, the bartender replaces the balls in their original positions. Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting impatiently for the bartender to return with the money from the cash register. Then he downs his drink and quickly strokes out his shot, the ball banking crisply and directly into the corner pocket. There is a cocky leer on his face as he reaches for the dollar bills. The door of the Packard coupe slams shut. Eddie Felson holds up his stuffed billfold for his pal, Charlie Burns, to see. He tosses it on the seat beside him and turns on the ignition. Henry nods, then steps up on a stool to fix the minute hand of the clock. It now stands at ten o'clock. It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns first enter into Ames. Only one table is in use; the hall is empty. In Eddie's hand is his leather cue case. They stand before the swinging doors and look around. They saunter over to the cashier's cage. A sign on the brass bar reads NO GAMBLING ALLOWED. Eddie's arrival is noted by Big John and Preacher, a gambler and an addict, who hang out at Ames at all hours, waiting for action.",
    "393": "The Dude is looking around at the '60s modern decor. He hands him the drink and taps his forehead with one finger. Treehorn waves this off. He is getting to his feet but sways woozily. He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude. He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table. He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together. Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes. The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls. The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song. She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball. The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free. He is face down, his arms, torpedo-like, pressed against his sides. The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up. Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down. He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins. We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light. It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans. He turns and runs, fists pumping. The field of black is punctured by headlights. The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.",
    "281": "Her head rests on the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose. Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window. She is reading a book held in one hand while eating a sandwich in another. Miss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her. Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare. Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment. He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully. Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light. He is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody. At that moment, the songwriter returns to his composing. Although it is not complete, it is farther along than before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion. Lisa just stares at Jeff for a moment. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this, we hear Lisa's voice. Jeff puts out a restraining hand. At last, the salesman is seen coming along the corridor. Slung over one shoulder, with his arm through it, is a large coil of sturdy rope. He goes through the living room into the bedroom. Jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars, and trains them on the salesman's apartment. Lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at Jeff, suddenly sits upright and then, getting up from the divan, moves over to Jeff, the camera going with her. In a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window. He drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise. The camera moves in as Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair. Jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move. She turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds' apartment. A dim light burning behind them. The drawn shades of the newlyweds' apartment. Jeff looks, turns back to her, trying to suppress a chuckle. She is still staring out the window as the scene. We see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. Jeff is seated in the dark, his face lit by the faint glow from the distant street.",
    "136": "The others laugh; Nehru suffers. Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car. He looks around the ashram a little dismally. Gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes. Nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him. Beside them, the river; in the background the business of the ashram goes on. His smile is sardonic, but genuine, theirs embarrassed and self-conscious. Gandhi has finished the last potato. He glances at Nehru then drops the potato in the bowl. He lifts the pail of peelings to Nehru. Nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly. His friends watch with amusement, but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen. He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he keeps right on talking. They have reached the trough. He meets Nehru's gaze, and for a moment something deeper than argument passes between them. Then something catches Gandhi's eye. He looks off. Ba stands, watching him, waiting. Gandhi turns. The goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes. He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen. Nehru grins, captured by Gandhi's seriousness, and his humor. He hasn't moved, and neither have his friends. They watch Gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen, carrying the bowl of potatoes. Clothes are dipped in the brownish water. Ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river, washing clothes. It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water. But they are laughing at their task. Gandhi sits cross-legged, watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat. The fingers are thin, half-starved, like the man himself. He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly. Ba sits at one side in the shadows watching him as intently as Gandhi. His voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying desperately not to show it. The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's agony. She glances up at Gandhi. The camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train. From its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be. The station house.",
    "894": "The older newcomer takes a seat as Purvis approaches. Horses barrel down a racetrack, jockeys crouched on their backs, while an announcer watches from a tower and onlookers crowd the rails. Among them, Billie grins, Dillinger beside her. In cheers, the horses race shoulder to shoulder. Later, outside the racetrack, Nitti and D'Andrea sit by a patio table by a grassy crowd as Nitti summons a breath, squinting in the sunlight. D'Andrea waves at Dillinger across the crowd and glances around. Later, Dillinger plumps into a chair in the grandstand with Billie sitting beside him. One row down, Pete leans closer and Homer listens too. Homer speaks up, and Dillinger faces his girlfriend, who glares at him and then drops her gaze. D'Andrea joins him and leaves, while Billie stares off. Dillinger frowns, shifts in his seat, and squarely faces Billie as she hangs her head. Billie allows a thoughtful smile, leans forward, cups the back of Dillinger's head in her hand, and presses her lips to his. He pulls away, gazes into her eyes, and kisses her again as spectators stand and cheer on the race. Now in a town, a brambly bush grows by a biro cactus and a healthy saguaro as Billie and Dillinger enter the lobby and stroll toward the front desk. A balding clerk faces them, hands Dillinger a pen, and the gang leader signs a guest register. Dillinger picks up a suitcase and heads off with Billie to a hotel room, where he opens the suitcase, takes out his Tommy gun, and cocks it. Later, he opens a window and pulls the sheer curtains closed. The gang leader takes off his suit coat and handgun, ambles to a set of closed double doors, and pushes one open to peek into a bathroom where Billie sits nude in the tub. As he opens the door all the way, she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain out of the water, then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot, running her toes along a soap dish. As Johnny turns back to the bedroom, the door bursts open and the balding man from the front desk leads other men in, clouding Dillinger with the butt of a rifle. As another lawman handcuffs him, Billie runs out wearing a towel. Later, the lawmen lead Dillinger into a jail as more officers escort Pete and the heavyset bank robber. Pete struggles as his captors lead him away from his boss. A lawman shuts a door, showing an isolated cellblock. Inside, the officers lock Dillinger inside a holding cell and remove his handcuffs through the bars. Wearing cowboy hats, the officers head out, while Dillinger massages his wrists, gazing off. He paces forward and leans tensely on a rail attaching the cell bars one to the next.",
    "1070": "As the boys run pell-mell into the water, the Japanese soldiers advance past the Mission buildings. The refugees pick their way through the ruins of the Mission's wooden jetty as the Japanese search the buildings on the beach. Magarri runs through the shallows with his rifle, and the boys move out beyond the end of the burning jetty and start to swim, using a piece of driftwood as a float. The Japanese run down to the beach, following footprints. Magarri loads and hides behind one of the wharf's supports, gasping in fear as the soldiers approach, and takes aim. Drover and the boys arrive at the boat, climbing the ladder while soldiers fire at Magarri, who shoots back. As Magarri reloads, he looks across at Drover and the boys climbing onto the boat, then looks round at the soldiers getting closer. He drops his rifle and sprints up the beach to distract the Japanese. Drover gasps as Magarri, hit in the back, falls to the sand, and he and the boys stare helplessly as the soldiers run up to the wounded man. The soldiers raise their rifles and an officer cocks his pistol. Magarri looks towards the boat as Drover and the boys watch the soldiers move away from the body. The sail is raised and Ivan gets slowly to his feet. Flames roar into the air, and King George, watching the soldiers work in the ruin, rubs dye into his cheeks. The soldiers move slowly through the flaming, smoking ruins of Darwin as hoses spray water on the fires. Captain Dutton gets out of the truck, and in her wrecked room over the pub, Sarah looks at a photograph of her, Nullah, and Drover, before looking tearfully down at Dutton issuing orders on the wharf, his eyes filling with tears of self-pity. Bomb ships burn in the bay, and Dutton comes up to Sarah's room, where tears roll down her cheeks with her eyes closed. The boys' boat sails into Darwin as men clamber into trucks, ready to evacuate south. The small boat sails past a huge burning ship, while Sarah tearfully watches the evacuation. A black soldier stands stripped to the waist, watching the trucks. Sarah looks at the ruins of the Territory Hotel and sighs. As she climbs into the truck, the small boat sails into view by the wharf. King George is up on the wreck of the Carney Cattle Company water tower as Nullah reaches into his pocket and pulls out Flynn's harmonica. Sarah hesitates by the truck, listening, and shocked, she turns to Dutton. Drover strokes the lad's hair as he plays, while the priest conducts the choir. Drover stands at the stern of the boat.",
    "267": "As she runs for the back door and pushes through it, and as he slaloms through the wildly scattering hayseeds, Lenny bursts out. With a whipcrack effect, he looks left, then right, and jerks the bike right to where an alleyway flanks the side of the bank. Ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as Lenny enters, and he roars after her, roaring down the alley as the bike approaches behind her. Closing on Ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley, a plank swings into frame straight at the camera, matching action as Hi finishes swinging the plank into Lenny's face. Lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him, riderless, twisting crazily into the street where it collapses. Lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods encouragement to Ed, and Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife. Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as the knife is thrown, and it thunks into the plank, piercing it through. Hi backs up, swinging the knife-studded plank to make Lenny keep his distance as he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder, and the free chain drops down into his palm. Swinging the chain, WHOOSH WHOOSH, at the backpedaling Hi, the chain snakes around it and rips it out of Hi's hands. Grabbing Hi by the shirtfront, Lenny swings down and brass knuckles appear on it, as Lenny's fist swings into frame to club him forehand, then backhand. An uppercut from his heels sends Hi sprawling back as Hi lands against it, banging his head, and he sinks to the ground. Lenny is casually walking toward him, lighting a cheroot, as Hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car. Hi's face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape, behind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle. The shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib, and Lenny pulls. Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car, struggling to stand up. Lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug, crushed against Lenny, his hands paw futilely at Lenny's chest. Lenny finally flings Hi away, landing in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him, tired of the fight: he saws out both shotguns. On the guns as Lenny's thumbs draw them back, he raises the guns to fire, the end of the road, he wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front of him, then stops, staring at.",
    "353": "Some men are backing away, losing their nerve, while Aragorn gallops in front of his army, fixing each of his men with his eyes. Aragorn holds Andúril aloft. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are climbing the face of Mount Doom, where the landscape is violent, red heat hisses out of fissures, the jagged rock is razor sharp, and ash blankets the land. Red lightning forks across the sky with a deafening crack. Close on Frodo and Sam's feet dragging across the ash, their parched lips, and sweating, dusty faces. Frodo trips and falls face-first into the dust, with Sam dropping beside him. Aragorn's army is surrounded by 300,000 Orcs poised to attack. Frodo slowly lifts his head and looks up, straight up the steep slopes of Mount Doom, a huge mass of ash, slag, and burned stone. Frodo begins to crawl on his hands and knees, hauling himself a few pitiful feet before slumping in the ash. Gimli surveys the army of Mordor and looks up into the eyes of Legolas, with whom he has shared much, and the gruff dwarf smiles quietly. Sam crawls to Frodo, who lies slumped against the rock-face, and turns him over, holding him in his arms. Frodo shuts his eyes, his breath coming in gasps, as Sam looks at him with grim determination. Sam lifts Frodo onto his shoulders and starts to climb Mount Doom, his hobbit-face growing stern, almost grim, with determination. The two tiny hobbits struggle on the endless shale slopes. Aragorn and company watch as they are surrounded by a tide of Orcs. Aragorn raises Andúril in a broad sweep as he walks forward, turning to face the others with quiet resolve written on his face, looking into the eyes of the remaining members of the Fellowship. Aragorn turns, sword-raised, and charges forward; a moment of silence follows, with no one else moving. Suddenly, a shout goes up, and angle on Pippin and Merry charging forward with the rest of the men following. Aragorn crashes head-on into a line of Orcs, the blade of Andúril flashing as he hacks at them. Like a small grey insect, Sam creeps up the slope with Frodo on his back, foot by foot, as the mantling cloud swirls, revealing the cruel pinnacles and iron crown of Barad-dûr, the Dark Tower, in the distance. Sam staggers under Frodo's weight as strong ash-laden winds buffet him while he slowly climbs Mount Doom, with the plain of Gorgoroth lying 1000 feet below, wrapped in fume and shadow. A tremor ripples through the ground, and a red flame explodes into the sky, causing Sam to look up, fearful the mountain could explode at any moment. Through the thick, fume-laden air, a set of stairs can be made out.",
    "1188": "A tiny, silvery breath floats back into Sirius' mouth, and his chest heaves as he gives a great sigh. The light draws back across the lake while Harry watches the bright light fade away, leaving only the faint image of a figure standing on the far shore. He falls back beside his godfather, and they lie next to each other, sprawled unconscious on the stony beach. In the hospital wing, he pats Ron's bandaged leg and walks to the door. Hermione is wearing a long chain necklace, and she puts it around Harry's neck as well and spins its golden pendant. The room is filled with people moving backwards very fast, and she replaces the necklace. The wheels of the great clock turn as they cross the quadrangle below and run along the cloister. She shows him the pendant, and they hide. Harry and Hermione creep out from their hiding place, and Harry looks around nervously as they run towards a huge stone. Standing behind it, they look down the hill and watch themselves running along the path below towards Hagrid's cottage and the pumpkin patch. Harry and Hermione hurry down the path and hide behind the pile of pumpkins as Dumbledore, Fudge, and the Executioner arrive. She pulls him back out of sight when Hermione sees a pebble lying on the pumpkin in front of her and throws it through the window, then throws another as Harry rubs his head. Dumbledore knocks at the front door, and as the three men go inside, the back door opens. Quickly, they run into the forest and observe themselves and Ron leave the cottage and hide behind the pumpkins. Pushing aside a branch, Hermione stares at herself in the past, and the branch springs back. Hermione and Harry watch themselves and Ron run back up the hill, then they creep back into the garden and peer towards the cottage. Crows peck at Harry's feet as he steals across the garden, and Harry bows to Buckbeak, who lowers his head in return. Harry stretches towards the post where Buckbeak is chained, and a crow pecks his hand as he undoes the chain. Buckbeak won't move, so Harry hauls on the chain. Hermione throws the ferret, and Buckbeak follows them into the forest. Fudge turns as the Executioner raises his axe and splits a pumpkin in frustration. Harry and Hermione use the dead ferrets to lure Buckbeak deeper and deeper into the safety of the forest. Leaving the hippogriff in a clearing, they run out of the trees until they see the Whomping Willow in the distance, flailing its branches. Lupin points his wand, and the tree falls still before he goes down under the roots. Snape follows Lupin, and they sit down beside each other on the grass. As darkness falls, a swarm of bats flutters through the forest.",
    "350": "The Mumakil react with terror as spectral warriors climb up their sides, routing the Haradrim from their war-towers, and orcs flee in their thousands. The army of the dead swarms over the city, routing the orcs. Eowyn crawls to where Theoden lays, mortally wounded. Theoden looks up at Eowyn, his breathing shallow and his vision clouded. Eowyn smiles down at him as she gently strokes his face. Theoden is dying. The army of the dead slowly dissolves into dust and is immediately swept away by the four winds. Aragorn turns to Gandalf, who bows his head in homage. Pippin, in his Gondorian armor, looks around at the devastation, his eyes full of sadness. They suddenly fix on something, and Pippin runs through the ruin of the battle towards a small figure slumped on the ground. Merry stares unseeing at Pippin, horror and shock erasing all other memories from Merry's mind. Tears fall down Pippin's face as he looks on his friend. Pippin covers Merry with a blanket. The camera rises towards the dark orc tower of Cirith Ungol, and a light glows from the topmost window. The camera reaches the tower, dissolving through the wall into a small cold room. Frodo Baggins is unconscious on the floor. His eyes suddenly flicker, and he wakes up. Tilt up to reveal the orc and Uruk-hai, Gorbag and Shagrat, arguing over Frodo's belongings and clothes. Gorbag is snatching for the mithril vest. Frodo realizes that he has been stripped down to his underwear. He clutches at his throat; the ring has gone. Gorbag grabs for the mithril vest and draws his sword, but Shagrat kicks him backwards with his foot. Gorbag falls through a trap door leading to the floor below. Gorbag lands in the guard room with a crash, creating sudden alarm amongst the orcs and Uruk-hai stationed there. Shagrat leans through the trap door. Several Uruk-hai converge on Gorbag, and he lashes out, slashing one across the throat with his sword. The dead Uruk-hai topples backward over the parapet, landing on top of Uruk-hai and orcs in the courtyard below. Within moments, a brutal civil war breaks out between the two companies stationed in Cirith Ungol. Sam hurries towards the gate, fearful for Frodo. Sam is confronted with the sight of over 50 slaughtered orc and Uruk-hai, strewn over the courtyard. Angle on: Sam pounds up the staircase. He suddenly pauses. Several Uruk-hai are running down towards him. He grips Sting and continues charging up, screaming at the top of his lungs. Angle on: the four Uruks. They see a huge distorted shadow on the wall in front of them. They turn around and flee in terror back to the top of the stairs. Sam appears, and before the Uruk-hai can fully regain their wits, he slays three.",

Miranda has her hand held out for them. Andy holds out a folder, which Miranda ungraciously accepts. Andy's taken aback. Andy glances down at the papers in her lap, and then looks across at Miranda with sympathy. Miranda hands back the seating chart. Back in her own suite, Andy has changed into a slim-fitting low cut black suit. She studies her reflection in a big mirror and touches up the mascara on her long, black lashes. Nigel comes in and studies the outfit she's wearing. They raise their glasses. Andy and Christian in an elegant restaurant. After dinner, they stroll near the Notredam Cathedral. She swings around a lamppost. Christian kisses her. He kisses her again and again. She kisses him back, wrapping her arm around his neck. They are surrounded by bare trees adorned with fairy lights. There's a view of the Eiffel Tower from Christian's hotel bedroom window. Andy wakes up in his bed alone, and puts her hand to her head with a grimace. She rolls over and consults her watch on the bedside table. Pulled on her clothes and is hopping around about trying to put her shoes on. Andy goes to grab her jacket and knocks over Christian's bag. Christian comes out of the bathroom in a towel. Andy grabs her stuff and goes. Walking along a modern bridge over the sand, she calls Miranda's suite. Andy gets back to the hotel and pauses before knocking on Miranda's door. Miranda and Irv shut the door in her face. She's changed into a black dress with a scoop neck, a full skirt with petticoats, and wears black gloves and a silver necklace. At the event, she paces the hallway. Nigel steps down from the podium. Miranda makes her way over from the table she's been sitting at. They had gathered in a plush banqueting suite with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Andy spies Christian sitting with Jacqueline. Miranda kisses Nigel before taking her place. James gets up and salutes his fans. Andy and Nigel smile over at him. Nigel's excited smile fades and he looks up at Miranda crestfallen. Pretty Jacqueline beams delightedly. Nigel puts on a brave face and applauds her. Jacqueline stands. Andy looks over at Miranda incredulously. Up on the podium, Miranda smiles and applauds Jacqueline as Irv eyes her coolly. Andy glances over at Christian, who looks stunned. James preens himself smugly. Nigel fidgets in his seat.

    "687": "Octavius lies face down on the operating table, a bandage over his eyes. He spins around, and one of the limbs knocks him through a glass door. The other three break free and start moving; one grabs a woman by the leg, and a male medic is thrown across the operating room. Another limb smashes through a table, clamps onto a man's face, and tosses him across the room, while a man is smashed into a lamp and electrocuted. The nurse is dragged along the floor by the leg, and her fingernails cut grooves in the floor. A man is grabbed by the throat and slammed against the table, spotting a chainsaw as another medic is rammed into a wall. The doctor by the chainsaw reaches for it but is pushed to the floor, and the chainsaw pulls down weakly. He tries in vain to cut into the limb that's pinning him to the wall, as the other three limbs sense danger and move towards him, viewing with inbuilt cameras. The mechanical limbs move in for the kill, and the chainsaw drops to the floor on the end of the man's limbed arm. Octavius lifts his head, and using its small pincer, one of the mechanical limbs gently pulls the bandage from his eyes. Octavius opens his eyes and looks about him wearily, alarm spreading over his face as he kneels up on the operating table, the limbs rising with him. He tips back his head, and later, doors fly off the hinges. A yellow cab speeds towards him, then skids to a halt. Octavius cringes, then seems surprised when mechanical limbs lift the cab up and through the air; it lands on another yellow taxi. Viewed through the fractured windscreen of the cab, two of the limbs move up to Octavius' face, and they detect a siren, prompting Octavius to slip away. Later, with the long mechanical limbs acting as legs, Octavius is carried onto a bridge tower. The pincers spot a ramshackle pier and a derelict warehouse way below, and Octavius peers down at it. On a sunny day in his office, Jameson addresses bulky Robbie, surprised and shooing Peter away. Octavius is in the warehouse on the dilapidated pier, staring down through gaping holes in the floor as the mechanical limbs move slowly about him like mythical serpents. He looks at the reptilian limbs in desperation and stares forlornly into the water. Two of the limbs open their pincers aggressively, and all four mechanical limbs hover with their pincers open. His face strained, eyes widening, he reaches behind his head, spins back around, and the pincers near his face and move as if talking. Troubled, Octavius closes his eyes and stares hard at the floor.",
    "965": "He makes a left turn and pounds through a puddle. At the Adjustment Bureau, an aide hurries up to Thompson. At the courthouse, Adrian greets Elise with a hug. As she steps by, he gazes after her. Meanwhile, David sprints through the downpour reaching the targeted blue door. He ports through and finds himself at a service counter at the New York DMV. A bewildered customer peers at the rainy street left exposed in the open doorway. David races out a lobby door. At the Bureau, Thompson and aides cross a room stocked with hats. Thompson halts, glances at his aides plan book, and rushes off. In the rain, a sprinting David holds a hand out to traffic. He dashes across the street and climbs the courthouse steps two at a time. In the lobby, he crashes into a bystander knocking him down. His hat comes off and a guard approaches. He grabs the hat. Adrian addresses Elise's friend. On her way out, she passes a gaunt stranger in a fedora. A bailiff signals him to take it off, and he does. In the lobby, he races to a metal detector, and wrenches off his jacket and empties his pockets. He slides it along the table as he darts through the checkpoint. Leaving his other belongings, he halts under a rotundas decorated ceiling. Later he runs up a spiral stairwell. Now as Thompson meets his team in the rotunda, David races past Elise's friend outside the courtroom. He bursts into the Ladies Room. She stares at him. The gaunt bureau officer enters. David coldcocks him. He picks up the officer's plan book, and shows it to Elise. An aide with Thompson consults his book. In the warehouse officers, clad from head to toe in black, get into SUVs. Meanwhile in the Adjustment Bureau. In the courthouse Ladies Room David braces a mop handle behind a radiator barring the door. He checks its sturdiness, then checks the deadbolt. Crossing to her, he puts on the fedora. David opens the closet door and ports them onto Yankee Stadium's grassy outfield. Elise gapes at the abrupt change and setting. David rushes her to a padded doorway in the playing field wall. It ports to a stairway. Climbing it, the couple find themselves in Manhattan's business district. Back in the courthouse Ladies Room, a bureau officer kicks in the door. Thompson and his team enter glancing briefly at their unconscious colleague. Meanwhile, David and Elise race hand in hand down the bustling city street. In the Ladies Room, Thompson notes the plan room lying open on the sink counter. His aide consults his own book. With David, she shakes her head. She nods. Now Thompson and his aide emerge from the underground stairway and arrive in the business district.",
    "518": "She, too, is deep in thought and she stops at the edge of the wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water. The piano piece ends and the film is quiet. The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room. One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen. The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull. The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the CAT-scan module. From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer. While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module. Dr. Brooks, holding Mickey's X-rays, walks past a row of bookshelves to his light panel. He props up the X-rays. Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey. The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face, reacting in total despair. He closes his eyes; he covers his face with his hand. Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief. Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs. Suddenly he stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting. Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf. Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera, his coat still on, looks out at the Manhattan skyline. Gail gets up from her chair. She walks past Mickey to a nearby cabinet. She opens a drawer, rummaging around for something. The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly. As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk. Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum.",
    "1255": "She looks at Carl with a suspicious frown and takes a photo, then smiles as she halts cheekily. Carl smiles, turns away, and eyes her scooter. They tear down a road on the scooter, with Carl sitting behind the woman, Allison, wearing a helmet and clinging onto her. They weave in and out of the other traffic as she speeds up, overtaking two vehicles. Allison holds up her camera to take a picture while she veers across the road onto the wrong side. Oncoming cars swerve as they head up a tree-lined hill, and in the park by Carl's car, he pours petrol into his car and breaks into a smile as he hands back the camera to her. He gazes at her feigning surprise as she, wearing the helmet, marches over to him, presses herself against him, and kisses him hard on the lips. She draws back, leaving him dumbfounded as he gazes at her getting back onto her scooter. She drives off with a smile, and his eyes follow her as she goes. He turns back slowly, smiling to himself, then looks down at holding the Polaroid of them on the scooter in his hand. He scrutinizes the photo, nods and smiles, and his eyes dart around nervously. He puts the petrol cap back on, smiles, nods, and checks out the photo of him and Allison as Norman punches the air and smiles wistfully. Later, Carl sits in front of his computer at the bank as three guys stare at him. He clicks to enlarge another pop-up, and a corpulent woman heads over, gawking at him before beaming. Carl stamps the form with an approved stamp as a slice has been cut from the cake, and he high-fives Norman, forcing a grin. At the Bigfoot Lodge, Carl, Peter, and Rooney sit in a booth, and Carl glances at Rooney as they slam down shot glasses. Carl spits out a lime, snorts Tabasco sauce off his hand, grimaces, slams his fists on the table, and knocks over all the glasses. He plays on an arcade dance game, where the figure and arrows on the screen show him which moves to execute as he stands on a platform with arrows to the right, left, back, and front, moving his feet to the correct place to the beat. A crowd gathers to watch as he moves quickly, hopping about and spinning around, achieving a perfect score. Peter and Rooney smile and cheer as he moves nimbly, twirls with his leg out, making people duck out of the way, and finally collapses backward, where Peter and Rooney catch him. Carl snogs someone as a big burly guy approaches, and Rooney frowns. Outside, Carl is down as he crashes into a bin.",
    "1116": "Vernon lands flat on his back in a bush. He scrambles to his feet and stares angrily after the car as it disappears into the night sky. From the back seat, Ron smiles at his friend. The suburbs are left far behind. As day breaks, the car reaches open countryside. It sweeps down over green fields and trees towards a ramshackle house beside a lake. The car touches down on a narrow sandy track and bumps along it past an outhouse. Two pale pink pigs look up curiously from their sty. Harry's eyes are wide with amazement. The three brothers unlock the door and creep stealthily into the house. Harry looks around the kitchen with delight. A pan scrubber cleans a frying pan which holds itself under a running tap. Ron grabs a bun. Next to an armchair, a pair of needles hang in mid-air knitting a multi-colored garment. A young girl appears. Embarrassed, the girl disappears upstairs. Mr. Weasley joins them at the table. An old grey owl flaps wearily towards the house and hits the window. Percy takes an envelope from the owl's beak. Beside the fireplace, wearing his school cloak, Ron steps into the fireplace and takes a handful of powder. Ron disappears in a flash of green flames. Harry steps forward nervously. Harry takes a handful of powder. Standing in the fireplace, Harry takes a deep breath. Harry disappears in a flash of green flames. Mrs. Weasley looks confused. Harry shoots out of the fireplace onto a dusty wooden floor. He is streaked with soot and ash. He picks up his glasses and puts them on. One of the lenses is broken. He gets up slowly and looks around the gloomy shop, at the glass cabinets covered in cobwebs. They are all piled high with shrunken heads and skulls of all shapes and sizes. Cautiously, he moves towards a shelf and taps idly on a glass dome. Beside it, a skeletal hand with bony black fingers is mounted on a piece of marble. Harry puts his fingers around the bony thumb. The hand suddenly closes, clutching him tightly. He struggles desperately to free himself from its ghastly grip. The hand releases him, and he hurries across the shop towards the open door which leads out into the alley. Outside, he finds himself in a damp, dingy passageway. He passes a suspicious-looking man lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, a sharp-faced witch with a pointed hat grabs him by the arm. He is surrounded. He is terrified. Harry runs towards Hagrid, a giant with bushy hair and a huge black beard. In Diagon Alley, a girl with long wavy hair comes out of a shop and spots them.",
    "539": "Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff and head down the passageway. As it gets dark, the temperature drops several degrees, and the light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden, and see four men digging with shovels and pick-axes, with the fourth man wearing a leather waist jacket and a brown felt fedora hat. Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box, who steps toward a lantern resting on a rock and puts the box next to the lantern. Halfbreed pushes Roscoe, who jumps with excitement, while Rough Rider steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it and takes a bejeweled cross from the box, holding it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it. Indy takes off his hat, looks down at the off-screen action, and continues to admire the cross before placing it on the rock next to its box and the lantern. Indy turns back to observe the men with a look of resolve, then turns back toward Herman, but watches in wide-eyed horror as a snake slithers across his lap. Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside, causing Herman to gasp. Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf, pulls him closer, releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat, and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the cross on the rock next to the lantern, and as the robbers continue to search for additional valuables, he works his way unseen within arm's reach of the cross. With Fedora looking over at the men digging, Indy picks up the cross, puts it in his pants, and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention, and the three robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy that they almost knock each other over. Only Fedora is unperturbed; he casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companions and sets off after Indy. Indy emerges from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day, hears running footsteps behind him, and dashes off. Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe quickly appear and run after him. Indy jumps from one rock to another, where the scout troop horses are below, puts two fingers in his mouth, and whistles for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the cross in his belt, prepares to jump, and then jumps into the saddle.",
    "569": "The elevator doors slide open on Men in Black headquarters. One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter. Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops. Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves. They leave the room. On the main floor, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall. The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them. On the screens, we see live images of aliens. Bony fingers. Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean face, cat glasses. Zed, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to Edwards, sizing him up. Zed's voice comes over. Edwards reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a black suit hung from a hanger in the middle. On the bottom, a pair of shiny black shoes. Kay is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. Zed's voice continues. Edwards stands in a cramped white booth. He holds both his hands on a ten-fingered keypad, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a searing sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints. One by one, Kay deletes Edwards's identity cards. On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- James Darrel Edwards III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name. More letters are eliminated from his name. A tie pushed up. Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, James D Edwards III -- or, rather, Jay -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He slips on the sunglasses. The older man (Rosenberg) is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive shop. A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off Edgar's neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down the street, one under each arm.",
    "1022": "Debbie looks down at her untouched plate. Her eyes shift to the phone and she picks it up. She scrolls through a number of pictures of her dad's family. A photo shows him huddled with his young wife, a teen boy and girl. In another photo, they stand around a soccer ball with the kids in uniform. A final photo shows him with his arm around his young daughter. Debbie pouts and slides the phone back. Debbie, Pete, and the girls sit around plates of vegetables. Debbie sighs as Sadie storms away. Now, Pete and Debbie drive down the coast. They pull up to a luxury resort. Now, they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. Later, they enter a bright hotel room. Debbie tosses her hat on the floor and hops onto a bed. Pete pushes open double doors leading to a balcony overlooking the ocean. He rushes onto the bed and kisses his wife. Now, in bathing suits, the couple jumps into a pool. Pete holds her and spins her. She puts her arm around his neck and kisses him. With their lips locked, they sink underwater. They lie in bed and share a long embrace. Pete pulls away with a satisfied smile. Pete trips off the bed. Now, they wear robes. They scarf down the cookies. Now jumping on the bed. Pete pulls up his robe and aims his butt at Debbie. They open their robes and embrace. Lying down, they passionately kiss. Now, a waiter pushes in a dessert cart. Now Pete does a magic trick. He holds a banana and oranges to his crotch. The waiter stands in shock. Debbie crawls. Debbie scurries across the floor. A starfish protrudes from his underwear. Now, they binge on desserts. She shoves it in her mouth. He sticks his tongue in her overstuffed mouth. Bits of dessert fall out. Back in the car. The hotel recedes in the distance. Debbie holds out her hand. Pete squeezes it and gives her a loving smile. They share a tender look. They turn back to the road. As they pull into their driveway, the smile fades from Pete's face. Debbie tightens her lips. Pete faces his wife. They linger in the car as Sadie and Jodi emerge from the house. Pete turns to Debbie with a cold stare. In Charlotte's bedroom. She glares at Pete. He shrugs. Pete sits in the corner. Now, Pete rides his bike with a group. At the house, Debbie enters the kitchen. In the bathroom, Pete lies back with his legs in the air. Debbie enters with an astonished expression. He takes cell phone photos of a mirror aimed at his spread butt cheeks.",
    "500": "Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. She goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister as Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees; he exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent and likes to think of himself as a real lady killer, making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair. Thelma watches approvingly. He's finally ready and walks to the door, giving Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek. Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand. They both hang up. Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition. Going into the suitcase are bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip. REVEAL Thelma standing in front of a closet, trying to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something. The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog; it's really frilly. A perfectly ordered suitcase contains everything neatly folded and orderly: three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, and one nightgown. She could be packing for camp. REVEAL Louise, whose room is as orderly as the suitcase, and everything matches. She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks, decides not to, and closes the suitcase. She goes to the phone, picks it up, and dials. They load everything into the car, and the trunk barely closes. They get into the car and pull out of the driveway. As they drive down the street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl; she is laughing and sticks her arms straight up in the air. They are driving down the interstate when Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun. Louise shrieks at the sight of it, and Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive. Louise reaches over, takes the gun out of Thelma's purse, tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat. Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring. Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC, and they are both silent for a minute. After a pause, Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in. They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.",
    "474": "Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle, and Joseph helps him out as Von Strack and Bonno nod, with Orsini-Rosenberg nodding without enthusiasm. Mozart stops short with a little giggle and giggles again, while Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly and the Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly. An embarrassed pause ensues, and Bonno giggles in nervous amusement. Joseph is clearly pleased and nods, having wanted this result all along. Then he notices the manuscript in his hand and goes to the forte-piano, seating himself. The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy, repeats a phrase dubiously, and all the courtiers look at Salieri. Mozart plays another phrase, gradually altering the music into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays with increasing abandon and virtuosity as Salieri watches with a fixed smile, and the court watches, astonished. Mozart finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph, and grins. We see the olivewood cross, and Salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another, and another, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note, the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in, and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. We dissolve on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on. The house is full, watching the performance conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra. Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten are grouped around the Emperor in a box. In another box, we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze – this is the formidable Madame Weber and her three daughters, Constanze, Josefa, and Sophie. All are enraptured by the spectacle, and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Cavalieri is singing Martern Aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen, and the music comes up again for the last 30 bars of the aria. All the cast is lined up on stage, and Mozart is conducting with happy excitement. Mozart bows frantically, over-excited. She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor, stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.",
    "51": "REGGIE takes another cigarette from her pack, rips off the filter, and puts it into her mouth and points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray. She hands the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first cigarette. The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup. DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel, first following DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner. Then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE follow. A moment later, DYLE passes a GIRL painting a canvas set up in the middle of the sidewalk, stops when he has passed her, and turns to look at her work. REGGIE, afraid she will be seen by DYLE, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE, which is already occupied by a middle-aged TOURIST, who looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE, and she stares back. He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her. REGGIE turns to look at DYLE, who has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on. The TOURIST finally finds the courage to speak, but as he opens his mouth, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, rises quickly from the table and leaves, leaving the TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, leaves some money on the table, and starts after her. REGGIE is following DYLE, and now the TOURIST follows her. She continues after DYLE, and the TOURIST hesitates but then continues following her. He goes to the curb, starts to step off, but finds the light against him and turns back in REGGIE's direction. Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns, takes the TOURIST's arm, and starts walking back to the cafe with him, leaving him standing there confused as she follows DYLE again. DYLE hops on the back of a bus as it pulls away. REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi. DYLE enters a building and walks to one of several windows with a sign over it. REGGIE then comes down the stairs but suddenly stops with a confused look on her face. As DYLE's turn comes, he addresses the CLERK who takes out a bundle of letters and sorts through it. DYLE stops, pondering what to do. The camera moves across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in the third one, on the phone.",
    "31": "With him are Herr Heinze, the German consul, Captain Tonelli, an Italian officer, and Lieutenant Casselle, Renault's aide. On any occasion when Major Strasser is crossed, his expression hardens into iron. Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm, and they shake hands. Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault, who salutes. Renault is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but also a shrewd and alert official. As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in front of Casselle and salutes Strasser, but Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following, with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a heated exchange of words. The neon sign above the door is brightly lit as customers arrive and go in through the front door. Again, we isolate on the neon sign before following a group of customers inside. Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue. The occupants of the room are varied, with Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled. Sam, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while accompanied by a small orchestra. There are Moroccans in silk robes, Turks wearing fezzes, and members of the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis. Two men sit at a table, with one man's companion seemingly uninterested in his dilemma, and sympathy evidently in short supply in Casablanca. At another table, a very well-dressed woman talks to a Moor, and she has a bracelet on her wrist. At another table, two conspirators talk, and one stops abruptly as two German officers walk by. A refugee and another man converse at another table. On the way to the bar, we pass several tables and hear a Babel of foreign tongues. Carl, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles, who walks, tray in hand, to a private door, over which Abdul, a large, burly man, stands guard. Abdul opens the door, and Carl goes into the gambling room, where there is much activity at the various tables. At one table, two women and a man play cards and glance at another table. One of them calls to Carl, who laughs. The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand, and we then see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table and then takes it. We now see Rick, an American of indeterminate age, sitting at a table alone playing solitary chess, as there is a commotion at the door with people attempting to come into the gambling room.",
    "168": "Another cheer rises, and when it subsides, Tyeb Mohammed stands near the back, seated with several other young men. The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause, and several people stand to look as well. Gandhi waits and then looks at the audience. This is the more sober Gandhi they have come to know. He looks down at the police to emphasize his point. The audience reacts tentatively but with uncertainty. Gandhi now has their attention and receives the response he wanted, a firm, mature, determined one. Gandhi holds up his hand and looks at the audience. After a moment, a merchant stands to signify his pledge, followed by Tyeb Mohammed and the youths around him. Then, throughout the theater and on the stage, everyone begins to stand until all are standing. Gandhi looks at the full theater, all standing, and takes a step forward. A prison door slams, focusing on one face, then another slam, another face, rhythmically in time with marching feet. Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed lead a large procession of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex with sheds, elevator platforms, and pulleys toward a distant city. Tyeb Mohammed touches Gandhi's arm and nods ahead as a canvas-topped open touring car (circa 1910) emerges from a turning between two factory buildings and approaches them. There is little hesitation in the ranks as the car gets closer. In it, there are two uniformed policemen and a civilian, who smiles slowly. He looks from Gandhi to the miners and then looks at Gandhi sharply before smiling derisively and signaling the car off. As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and Singh approach Gandhi, both wary of the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired. Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly but then turns to signal the miners to move on, and they start forward. The car rides past the factory building from which it turned, and suddenly mounted police swing out from the buildings to face the procession. Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh, and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly makes their pace more labored, while tracking back before the fast-approaching mounted police with batons at the ready. Gandhi screws up his courage and marches on. Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in defiance, and Singh forces himself along at Gandhi's side as the mounted police ride on with batons ready. Gandhi is in the front rank of the procession, watching the horses approach, with a blunt farmer's face.",

She sits down; he joins her. He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more. Dil's face, staring at him. She allows herself to be led out. Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window. They walk inside. Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness. He sits her down in one of the chairs. Dil nods. Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head leaps back. She stares at him. She takes a breath. Fergus begins to cut. CLOSE-UP ON DIL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream down her cheeks. She looks in the mirror at it in the dark. Dil enters with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the light. He stops her hand. She looks at her hand on his. Her fingers close around his. She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons. He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She stretches languorously down on it. She turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt. But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns. We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark. Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position. He wraps the shirt around her. She kisses him. Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand. Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude. Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag. She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly. Fergus opens what Jude has given him--looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls. He runs outside. Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him.",
    "675": "Peter stares through his dark-rimmed spectacles, then blinks. A lone figure stands on the flat roof of a tall Manhattan building. Down below, a street with four lanes of parked traffic. Across from it, another flat-roofed building. The figure is Peter, who strides with purpose away from the edge. His face full of resolve, he stops. Peter runs towards it, past the skylight jutting up, his face set in grim determination. His jaw clenched, his teeth gritted. He pumps his arms forward and back, as his pace increases and his stride lengthens. Pigeons take to the air as Peter passes. His eyes are focused on where he's going. He flings both arms back, then thrusts them forward as he leaps off the roof. His arms and legs flailing, he soars through the air. A washing line breaks his fall. He swings on it against the wall, onto the roof of a car, rolls off it, and hits another vehicle. He lifts himself up. He looks to see how far he's fallen, clutches his back, and hobbles between the cars and out of the alley parking lot. He leans on a parked car for support. John's at MJ's. MJ opens wedding acceptance cards. He kisses her outstretched hand. She studies him closely. He's lying on the sofa. He turns over and tips his head back on a cushion on the arm of the sofa. MJ, on her knees, leans over him, kissing him full on the lips, her head pointing the opposite way from his. He stretches out his left hand and holds her head still. MJ moves her head away and closes her mouth and her eyes. MJ's lost in memories. Her long hair trails down over his cheek, until MJ pulls back. She opens her mouth in a silent sigh and looks sad and reflective. MJ is sitting in a cafe with a glass front, leaning her head on her hand. Peter strolls in, and sits opposite her. He looks down as she stares intently into his face. Her eyes are fixed on him. Her face grows sad. He shakes his head. MJ purses her lips. Her eyes flit left and right. His head shakes slightly, as he gazes sorrowfully into her blue eyes. He looks at the table. She lowers her head, then raises it. Tears well in MJ's eyes. Her lips quiver. She leans forward. Peter looks up, surprised. She lays her hand on his. Her engagement ring shines brightly. Peter's eyes move up from her hand to her face. She stretches further across the table. He edges his mouth closer to hers, then stops. Her eyes are closed. Her lips offer to him. His eyes widen as a car comes flying towards the window.",
    "634": "Morgan takes Graham's hand and steps over Houdini, and they gaze down at the dead dog; Graham puts his hand on Morgan's shoulder, but Morgan brushes it away and trudges off solemnly. Graham steps up to the climbing frame and looks searchingly at Bo, who remains in a tight ball, staring down at the ground; he gently lifts her off the platform and holds her against his shoulder, carrying Bo back to the farmhouse as Merrill emerges, carrying a bowl and a bag of feed. Graham walks past him, climbs onto the veranda, and walks through the front door of the house. Merrill looks over to the climbing frame with a confused expression; he's in his early 30s with short dark hair and a boyish face. Merrill puts down the bag of feed and unties Isabel, the other Alsatian, from the veranda steps, leading her across the yard as Caroline pulls the barbecue fork from Houdini's throat. A wire wind chime in the shape of a beaming sun hangs on the veranda and swings mournfully in the soft breeze. That night, the farmhouse stands in darkness beneath a black sky. Graham lies on his side in bed, his eyes suddenly open as he stares ahead; Bo gazes at him. Graham pads across the landing to the children's bedroom, holding Bo by the hand, as they come to the open bedroom door and step into the darkened room, where Morgan lies half off his bed in an uncomfortable looking heap. Bo shuffles off to her bed, and Graham gently lifts Morgan up and lies him on his back, then walks across the bedroom and sits beside Bo on her bed. He gazes at her and looks her up and down; Bo looks at him through wide bright eyes, and a sadness falls across Graham's face as he looks at his daughter, then glances over at the bedroom window. A shadowy figure stands by a chimney pot on the barn roof, and Graham jumps to his feet. Downstairs in the lounge, Merrill is asleep in an armchair when Graham touches his shoulder, waking Merrill, who looks up at his brother in confusion. Graham and Merrill are by the front door, and Merrill opens the door; an outside light comes on, and they rush out and split up. Merrill comes to the back of the house as a dust bin is tipped over up ahead, while Graham runs along the side of the house, and the brothers meet up again at the front of the house. They stop and look around breathlessly when a sound on the roof of the house attracts their attention; Merrill keeps his gaze fixed firmly on the farmhouse roof as he paces backwards down the gloomy yard, trying to get a better view.",
    "642": "Jamal and Latika stare at each other. The guard presses the intercom and approaches to open the gates. Latika quickly moves inside the house. Jamal enters an expensively furnished marble living room and sees Latika behind the glass partition separating the room from a kitchen and approaches. She removes her dark glasses and stands expectantly as he steps from behind the partition. They both stand stock still, and she takes a sharp intake of breath. She smiles as he moves towards her, then they embrace each other tightly. Suddenly, she looks scared and backs away, and he looks at her shocked. A silver Mercedes pulls up to the house. As Javed steps into the living room, Latika puts an apron over Jamal’s neck. Javed walks straight into the kitchen and levels his malevolent gaze at Latika. He points to the game show on TV, walks into the living room, and sits down in front of a widescreen TV. He switches on the cricket game. Latika nervously prepares a sandwich for Javed. Jamal spreads a concoction of preservatives onto a slice of bread as Latika dumps a limp piece of lettuce on the plate, and Jamal and Latika exchange nervous glances. He grabs her hand. She breaks his hold, lifts the plate, and takes it to Javed. She passes in front of the TV, and Javed shoos her out of the way back to the kitchen. Javed watches the game and throws his drink. Jamal looks pleadingly at Latika. Javed, still transfixed by the cricket game, takes a bite of his sandwich, looks disgusted, and spits it out onto the plate. He walks into the kitchen, glares at Jamal, and goes back to the cricket, swearing under his breath. Latika pushes Jamal toward the door, slowly shakes her head, and pushes him out of the door. He remains in the courtyard looking back at her. Jamal takes a deep breath and raises his eyes upwards. The cricket match replays. He tenses his jaw muscles and hands back the check to the host. Jamal looks out of a train window as it races through the city. The train pulls into a large station, and he jumps off. Hundreds of passengers alight from the train and throng on the platforms. An enormous station clock shows five minutes to five. Now the clock shows five-fifteen. As Jamal moves along the walkway looking down on the platform, he scans the busy platforms and looks at the overhead clock. He rests his head on his hands in despair, then he squats down. Latika appears on the platform, looking around her. Jamal looks up and catches sight of her. He stands up immediately, and she looks very anxious.",
    "118": "Neff is in the booth dialing a number and looks around to ensure he is not watched before hanging up. The LaSalle stops in front of the market, and Phyllis steps out, entering the market and looking around. Neff moves slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge, as Phyllis approaches from beyond him, stopping beside him a couple of feet away. Phyllis moves close to him and looks at him sharply, sideways, but as a customer comes along the aisle toward them, they move apart. After the customer passes, Phyllis draws close again and takes Neff's arm, forgetting where she is, but he pulls away. Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold, hard eyes, as over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the commentary. Neff and Lola then climb over a low hill in the foreground under a starlit sky, with music from the Bowl playing Cesar Franck's D Minor Symphony. As he helps her climb up, the camera pans with them to show the expanse of the Bowl below, filled with a packed audience and the orchestra on the lighted shell. They sit down on the grass, with Neff sitting near but not too close to her, silhouetted against the shell lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match, glancing at her as she begins to cry. A pause follows before she starts crying again, while over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the commentary. Around 5:00 P.M. or a little later, a stream of office employees comes out of an elevator into the lobby, among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase. As the camera precedes him walking toward the entrance doors, he is stopped by Keyes' voice off to one side. Neff stops, looks towards the cigar counter, and moves toward Keyes, who is buying cigars and stuffing them into his pockets. Keyes bites off the end of the cigar, puts it into his mouth, and starts tapping his pockets for a match, as usual. Neff strikes a match for him before Keyes goes toward the street and out of the scene. Neff moves back into the lobby, followed by the camera, and as he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder to ensure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator, stops the machine, and sits down slowly, still holding the horn. Deeply moved, Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall.",
    "546": "Elsa is walking away in an open area, with torches, vehicles, and Nazi Officers in the background, one of whom is Indy, who comes up to her before she knows he is there. Indy pushes Elsa against a column and begins to search her clothing for the Diary, pulling the book from her pocket. His hands fly to her neck, but Indy releases her and backs away, and she looks at him with a lover's pain. Indy moves over to Henry, and they almost run headlong into Hitler and his entire entourage coming down from the podium. Fifty kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature, and Hitler pauses to sign them, then looks Indy's way, and they make eye contact. Hitler breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from Indy, opens it to the first page, and signs his autograph, then hands it back and moves on. Indy’s motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal as a Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing Henry's picture to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal. Henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as Indy enters down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder. They begin to walk toward the boarding gates, with Henry looking over his newspaper at Indy, but Indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned, rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin. Henry looks confused as everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy’s face. Vogel gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship, and he shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin. Henry opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it, looking up from it, then closes it and leans back in his seat. Indy stutters uncomfortably as Henry stares at him, waiting for a response, while sunlight falls across the table from the window, turning like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks. Indy appears puzzled as he and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin, where the Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed. Indy and Henry hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a pair of doorways framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin, with plenty of blue sky and white clouds visible, and a small Biplane suspended from the Zeppelin by a hook and crane device. Indy climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as Henry takes the tail gunner's seat, then they both become aware of a strange sound in the skies behind them. Two Messerschmidt fighter bombers streak out of the clouds and race across the sky, forcing them to shrink in their seats as the Messerschmidts, going three times as fast, scream past on either side.",
    "1100": "The gang drives up, and Thao eyes them suspiciously as the five mean-looking Hmong guys get out. Spider walks over to Thao and ruffles Thao's hair. Sue goes inside while Thao takes off his gardening gloves and stands with Spider and Smokie. Thao looks next door and follows them as the gang spots Walt's car. Meanwhile, Walt is in a bar with his buddies. They leave the others at the bar, and Walt makes to drink his whiskey but stops short before downing his shot in one, while Father J nods. A noise wakes Walt from his slumbers, prompting him to look out of the window where he sees torchlight in his garage. He gets up and goes over to a chest, opening it to pull out an old military rifle. He opens the breech, loads a magazine into it, cocks it, and then, rifle in hand, edges the garage door open and walks inside. He sees Thao with a torch beside the Gran Torino and as Walt advances, the barrel of the rifle knocks the overhead light, causing it to swing. By its swaying light, he aims the rifle at Thao, who backs away, stumbles, and falls backwards, tripping Walt in the process. The rifle goes off, shooting a sign on the wall as Thao runs out of the garage, leaving Walt sprawling on the ground. Thao runs to Spider's souped-up Honda in the street. Walt spits out some blood and pushes himself up. Mitch makes a phone call in his kitchen while Walt is in his garage installing window grills. Walt hangs up, and Mitch looks put-out. In his driveway, Walt lovingly polishes his dark green Gran Torino with gold trims. He buffs a wing of the car, works his way around to the bonnet, and carefully removes any marks. In the evening, Walt sits on his porch with his dog Daisy, lights a cigarette, and looks out at the Gran Torino parked on the drive as a couple of people walk by on the street. Walt swigs from a can of beer and as the light begins to fade, several beers later, he gets to his feet, calls to his dog, and heads inside. He switches on the porch light as he goes into the house and shuts the door behind him. At night, Spider's Honda pulls up on the street outside Thao's house and Spider and his cronies get out. They approach Thao and his sister Sue on the porch, and Spider tousles Thao's hair. Spider hustles Thao towards the car, but family members intervene and a scuffle breaks out. The scuffle spills over onto Walt's lush green lawn, breaking two garden gnomes. Rifle in hand, Walt marches onto the lawn and aims his gun at the squabbling guys.",
    "755": "He looks across the room, past the bed, to a second door. He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads. He kneels beside the boy, pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring. The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him. He silences the pair, hand out, palm down. In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet. The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old fashioned black radiator. Her knees are drawn up. The gown has slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator. Her head lulls on one side. From the other side of the room, David looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips. He crosses to the full length window and parts the curtains. After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape. He leans on the rail and looks over. The maintenance man in orange launches himself at David from inside the bedroom. David is hurled over the balcony. He lands on his face in water. He lifts his head. The black shiny surface on which he's lying begins to crease and sag. Water forms an ever larger pool around him. He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink. Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself. More ridges ahead and to his right do the same. Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it. From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water. Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again. His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light. High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony. Darkness and light alternate under the water as David struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover. Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the pool side.",
    "387": "He wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin. One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey bottle bobs. Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter. Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow. The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still looking at the young woman. He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his shoulder. Scattered by a strike. Donny calls out from the bench. As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that shares the lane. He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier. It scoots around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail. Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter. Walter takes out a gun. Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car. The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier. As the two men get into the car, Walter is still smug. A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-up old furniture. At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing kalhua, rum, and milk. A beep. It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans. The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua. We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway. Brandt talks back over his shoulder. Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks. He clears his throat. Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall. The soprano's singing is once again faint. Brandt's voice is hushed. We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form. He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side. CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler. We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell. The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up. He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket. Donny has been watching Quintana. They both look up. Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes. He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein). Behind him stands his partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.",
    "672": "In his room, Peter, his shadow thrown behind him onto the wall, stares at his own hand held out. His back resting on a pillow, Peter stares into space, his steely blue eyes bright and determined. Outside in a dark alley with ominous clouds in the sky, Peter stands with his Spider-Man costume held out in front of him. The wind ruffles his hair as he remains still for a moment. He drops the costume, then walks down the alley and away from the dust bin into which he has consigned the last vestige of the superhero. The sun shines as Peter, with a jaunty gait, strides through the city. Peter trips on the sidewalk. He awkwardly gets to his feet, reaches into his pocket, and hauls out his spectacles. He flicks them open, puts them on, and sets off a little wet. At home, he tightens up a wheel on his moped and spins it. The wheel rolls off the front forks and bounces out of the open window. He strolls away from a hot dog man and stands at the curve. Cop cars and vans and officers on foot race off in one direction. Peter munches his hot dog and sets off in the other. In his room, he studies. Peter's hand goes up. Peter grins proudly. On the campus, Doctor Connors races up to him. Peter stops and smiles. At the theater, MJ is distracted when she sees Peter in the audience. He grins inanely. She smiles sweetly. She ignores the prompt. She turns to her costar. MJ and Peter walk down the street side-by-side. Peter, standing beside her, gazes at her earnestly. Then they both resume walking. He looks at her through doleful eyes, and she scrutinizes his features. She turns away and crosses to a yellow cab. She opens the door of the cab and, before getting in, turns to look at him once more. Peter half smiles as MJ steps into the cab, shuts the door, and watches as the cab drives away. He slips on his spectacles. At the Bugle, a headline is being composed. Jameson's on the phone. He pulls Spider-Man's mask from a bag. Out comes the rest of the costume. The disgruntled garbage man goes. Robbie fondles the mask. In his office, Jameson, in the Spider-Man costume minus the mask, leaps onto his desk, a big cigar in his mouth. He flexes his wrists as if shooting out webs. His staff peer in through the slatted blinds. Robbie shakes his head. Two girls overtake him and giggle. He smiles and walks on past an alleyway. He sees two muggers attacking a dark-haired youth. Peter turns his back away, leaving the muggers punching and kicking their fallen victim.",
    "163": "There is silence, and an air of somnolence. We see the police commissioner, Suhrawardy, two doctors, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and some others. Nearer Gandhi, behind Mirabehn, are Nehru, Patel, Azad, and Pyarelal. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes. His weary eyes look at her; he looks up slowly to Azad. Gandhi looks at Nehru, who just nods tautly. Gandhi looks down, then lifts his head to Azad. The relief brings water to their eyes and grins to their faces. Nehru bends to Gandhi. Gandhi holds his hand out to him, and Nehru clutches it. Another click of a camera. He is not fully recovered, but well on the way. We get a wide-angle shot now and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her favorite subjects again. She is enjoying the banter, as is Mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and Patel, who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor. Pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this. And she shoots him again, as he hands the cloth back to Manu. Abha is sitting next to Manu, looking at a collection of pictures of Gandhi, obviously Bourke-White's. Abha suddenly holds a picture up for Gandhi to see. It's one of him, ears wide, eyes round. Gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles. But Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in Patel's words. Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti. He glances at it, and holds his arms out. The two girls help him. She is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the two girls. He moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel. Patel nods soberly and Gandhi starts for the door, Bourke-White moving with him. He has passed her, he's in the doorway. We see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften. He turns, teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women. She shoots him against the door -- the crowd milling distantly, waiting -- then she lowers her camera. He turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them. Bourke-White watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance. She turns to Mirabehn. Mirabehn accedes gravely. Bourke-White stares at her, then turns to look out at him. Mirabehn nods, but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face. Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on Manu, the other on Abha.",
    "1216": "The villagers have their hands behind their heads as they find armed men, and the soldiers open fire on them, causing women to cry and hide their eyes. Soldiers break into homes and drag out youths while the officer watches coolly. A soldier shoots a man dead, and then the commander addresses the village, leaving terrified women to cover their mouths. In Rambo's fort, sparks fly as he grinds round blades on a spinning wheel, his veins standing out on his muscular arms. He stops grinding, drops the blade, and runs a hand through his hair. Nearby, a rusty metal fan on a rod lies on a bench. He removes a nut from the rod, discards the fan, and replaces it with his creation, a new fan. He adds a nut to the thread at the end of the rod, reaches onto a bench, picks up a spanner, and tightens the nut. He deftly lifts the assembly off the bench and puts it down, then leaves the workshop and walks out into the rainy night air. His boat is moored below at the water's edge, and he looks down at it, where a solitary figure sits on the boat. Rambo wipes rain away from his face and walks down a wooden walkway to the boat, where Sarah is sitting under the boat's canopy. She stands, soaking wet, and he stares blankly at her. Sarah looks disappointed as she emerges from the canopy and walks past him, climbing onto the harbor. She begins to walk the length of the harbor towards the walkway, pauses, and brushes rain from her head. Rambo steps onto the harbor; she turns and stares at him before walking back towards him with an imploring look, brushing rain from her hair once more. Rambo stares at her, his face betraying no emotion. She turns away from him with a faint smile and walks back along the harbor, wearing a sodden gray hoodie and jeans, and climbs the wooden walkway. Rambo rubs his chin, runs a hand through his hair, and walks along the harbor. In the morning light on Rambo's boat as it motors along the river, Michael addresses his party while Rambo is at the tiller. Michael glances at Rambo, who affords him the merest flicker in return, as Rambo stoically leans on the tiller with both hands. Sarah approaches him, smiles, and turns away. At dusk, the boat motors around a headland, a small white glimmer appearing on the river and a cone-shaped reflection in the water thrown by the boat, which has headlamps mounted on its canopy. Michael and his volunteers doze in the boat, with Sarah nestled against Michael's chest, while Rambo's attention is caught.",
    "1289": "FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow, who is sitting in an overstuffed chair, and she slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality, and we see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again as Juno swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk, and she enters the DRUGSTORE. ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk wearing a polyester uniform vest, sneers at Juno from behind the counter and regards her with intense skepticism. An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach, but then sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down one of the aisles and desperately shakes the stick in an attempt to skew the results. Shake. Shake. Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, gnawing on the Super Rope, as she trudges toward her HOUSE where the yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wildflowers. She stops and loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion a noose. In Juno's BEDROOM, decorated with punk posters: The Damned, The Germs, The Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc., she picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend. LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that certain girls love to hoard, and Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well-manicured suburban lawn, making a formidable team. Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD to Juno with his foot, and she picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. Bleeker is putting on double socks in his Car-Bed, followed by putting on his sweat bands, and there is a close-up of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide and a close-up of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave. PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice and is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously. She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off. Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a lock around it. We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings, and we see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.",
    "183": "The camera pulls back, revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his hand, then further back. Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement, then slow, growing horror. Craning up past his parents standing there, up from the neighbor's house to a high shot of the neighborhood as the sounds of police sirens rise in the distance. Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the rain that pours down on a lonely strip of highway. A station wagon hisses along the wet road surface. Next to her in the passenger seat is Sam Loomis, a clinical psychiatrist. Marion, 30, drives. He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through pages in a manila folder. Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack. They look up ahead. Standing by the side of the road is a male patient, a wild-looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who stares at the station wagon. Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side of the road. Loomis jumps out. Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the patient, stand and talk for a moment, then hurry back. Camera moves with Laurie as she walks down the residential street. She carries a large bundle of school books in her arms. Across a backyard Tommy Doyle, an eight-year-old boy with tousled brown hair and bright blue eyes, comes running with his books. He catches up with her, and they walk along down the street. They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house set back from the street. Laurie holds up a key. Laurie walks through the front gate and starts up toward the porch. Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts the welcome mat, and places the key under it. Through a frost window, we see Laurie bending over the welcome mat. Suddenly a dark shape, the outline of a man, leans forward, watching her. As she walks back to Tommy at the street, the shape moves to watch them, then fades back into the interior of the house. Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street. Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street. We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance. Close to camera, the dark shape moves into frame, watching Laurie disappear around the corner. Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it. Loomis gets in the car. Loomis starts up the car and pulls away from the sanitarium. Wynn watches him go, then hurries back into the building. Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of high school students.",
    "43": "He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it as Reggie watches expectantly. Behind the ultra-modern glass and concrete structure of the Ecole Militaire, several delegates identified by little plaques listing their respective nations, along with their aides, sit around a large table, all wearing earphones. The Italian delegate is speaking when Sylvie jumps up, rushes next door into her booth, and shuts the door behind her. The British delegate rises to speak, continuing through the next scene, and hands her a paper, the one Grandpierre gave Reggie, which has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together. She turns back to the conference, flips a switch, and starts speaking into her headset. From Reggie's and Adam's angle, all the delegates and their aides suddenly turn, surprised, and look at the camera, from the delegates' angle. Inside the booth, Reggie and Adam can be seen heading for the door in a hurry as the delegates look at one another, confused, by the locked gate. A quick succession of shots shows a children's merry-go-round, Rond Point de Champs-Elysées with fountains playing, children's swings, Restaurant Laurent, and a balloon salesman. Adam stands by the large fountain, staring off at something as Reggie joins him, and he starts off. Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up, collecting quite a crowd. Into this area comes Tex, followed at a safe distance by Adam. Suddenly Tex stops, staring wide-eyed at something, neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths. As he wheels to look at another booth, in another arrangement, he turns crazily to look at another booth, then another, with various flash shots of stamps of all sizes, shapes, and colors, as he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into Adam, startling Tex, and they go off in opposite directions. As she hurries along a row of stalls, weaving around small groups of men standing together, showing each other stamps, searching in another section of the market, but it isn't, looking everywhere, suddenly she sees something. Only a small boy's elbow and part of his arm show, the rest hidden by all the legs, and she recognizes him from these fragments. She rushes to him, the camera panning with her. Jean-Louis stands looking at some stamps as Sylvie grabs him, and Reggie runs up and joins them. Jean-Louis looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember, seeing four of them—a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. As Reggie comes hurrying up the stairs, she goes first to Adam's room and knocks as Bartholomew, his face lathered for a shave, is on the phone.",
    "1042": "He looks down from the window at Barnes and Taylor. The Mayor waves to the crowd, then steps back from the lectern to welcome President Ashton with a handshake. Barnes sees an open window. A muzzle flash illuminates the window, and the President reels back before falling. Taylor yells to a stunned Barnes. Barnes looks back up. A bearded young man dashes to the podium. Barnes tackles him. Barnes stares down at the recumbent President. Taylor helps carry the President away. The President is loaded into an ambulance. The bearded young man. They lead him off. An exasperated look on his face, Holden turns away. They loop up on hearing the distant explosion. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt. He runs to him and grabs his camera. Barnes points. They rewind the camera in vision. Both men stare at the LCD screen. Flames and black smoke rise into the air. The smoke clears. Barnes is lying on the ground. He regains consciousness. There is a scratch on his grubby face. Barnes hauls himself to his knees. Barnes struggles to get to his feet. There are small fires all around. A man throws a blanket over a woman whose clothes are in flames. Barnes takes in the number of people lying injured. Barnes recalls the muzzle flashes in the window. Across the plaza, Matthews, clutching a chest wound, tries to sit up. Barnes runs across to him, past the mess of twisted metal crowd control barriers. Barnes bends down. Holden staggers over. Matthews falls still. Holden shakes his head. Barnes stares at his fallen colleague. Holden looks up to see the Spanish bearded cop with a gun. Holden chases after the bearded man who has holstered his gun. Barnes looks up as a GNN cameraman runs past. Barnes reads the GNN logo and leaps to his feet. He runs to the GNN outside broadcast van and enters the gallery. Barnes stares at the bank of monitors. The director watches him. Barnes sees a still frame of him being shot. Barnes searches for the cell phone. Rex watches as Barnes keys in numbers on his cell phone. He speaks into his cuff mike. He dials a number. The PA whispers into her cellphone. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the monitor. Karen glances around and manually rewinds the tape control. Barnes looks intently at the screen, his eyes unblinking. Barnes turns and runs out of the van. The events rewind. Barnes turning to Mathews. The explosion, the shooting. Taylor at Barnes' hotel door. The time on the digital clock moves to midday. The bearded man, Enrique, a handsome man in his 30s wearing a light open shirt over a dark tee shirt and with a bag over his shoulder, marches past the protestors on his way to the plaza.",
    "1074": "Flynn is drinking rum down below and hides the bottle behind a Bible before standing sheepishly with his hands in his pockets. She looks at a loss and downs her tea cup of rum in a gulp. A herd of horses has been rounded up and thunders past the house. Sarah looks out the door in amazement and stares straight into the eyes of the Drover, who is galloping alongside the herd. Flynn laughs in delight, and Nullah leaps for joy. Sarah runs along the verandah watching the spectacle. Drover reins his horse in, stares at Sarah, and takes off again as the horses are all rounded up. She runs indignantly after him, gets off her knees, and looks him in the eye. He considers the sleek black thoroughbred leaping in its enclosure, eyes her, and walks off. She's dressed for the English countryside and trots off in a huff as they start to ride around the cattle, moving them into a single herd. She gallops after the lone steer. Back at the house, her luggage is being packed. The sun beats down on the homestead, and the windmill turns slowly as Nullah and Daisy carry items of luggage for Sarah. A truck approaches, which Nullah spots, and his eyes widen. Nullah frantically climbs to the water tank as Sing Song grabs the dropped bags, and Sarah watches from indoors while Daisy climbs with her son, staying around the back of the tank hidden from the truck. Daisy is about to get in with the boy but has to duck down and stay on the ladder to avoid being seen as the truck halts. Sarah pulls back the curtain and looks out at the cops. As the men look the other way, Daisy hurriedly climbs in after Nullah. She takes the tea tray to her as one man walks slowly towards the tank. Daisy clings in fear to the ladder inside the tank as the cop turns the water on in the pump, and more water floods in the tank. Daisy holds her hand up for Nullah to grab. Tracker crouches, while Daisy and Nullah cling frantically to the ladder, which then collapses, and they fall into the water. Daisy lifts Nullah to grab onto a pipe, and she gets a grip too, but the bar breaks, and more water floods in. The sergeant looks out at the water tower, while the Aboriginal tracker looks up and sees water pouring out of holes at the top of the tower, and more continues to pour from the tower. Daisy puts her hand over Nullah's mouth as the tracker walks slowly away and the windmill turns faster. Daisy flounders and sinks beneath the surface.",
    "1235": "Ezra sits playing the piano in the foyer of a modern glass and steel mall as people of all different ages mill in the area, going about their business. Ben stands in a shop doorway watching Ezra play, appearing deeply moved and drifting off into his own thoughts. In a diner, a couple cuddles and giggles, while nearby, Ezra, who's in his 40s, sips from a mug at a table where a pretty, blonde waitress speaks to him. Ben sits watching nearby as Susan walks off, then watches sympathetically, gets up, throws money onto his table, and saunters over to Ezra's table. Ezra, an attractive man with an aquiline nose and longish brown hair, self-consciously smooths down his hair, unaware of Ben standing over him. Ben looks down at the pie on a plate in front of Ezra, whose blue eyes are clouded, and a look of surprise crosses Ezra's face as Ben goes. In Ben's motel, a single box jellyfish floats in his aquarium as Ben sits watching it. He sits motionless in the shadowy room, then goes to pick up his mobile, checks the display, and slowly opens it. Meanwhile, Emily is in the hospital lying in bed with air tubes running from her nose, fiddling with Ben's card. She holds her mobile away from her, looks at it briefly, snuggles down in the bed, and her smile fades. She closes her eyes and smiles, then her eyes are open again and she blinks, beginning to look drowsy. Phone to his ear, Ben walks towards the main door of the St. Matthew Center. The glass doors slide apart and he enters, walks down a hospital corridor towards Emily's room, stops outside her room, and looks at her through the window as Emily lies fast asleep surrounded by machines and monitors. Ben closes his clamshell mobile phone while Emily lies on her side with her ear pressed against her phone on a pillow. Ben slowly and gently pulls the phone out and shuts it, then stands looking down at her tenderly, puts Emily's phone on the bed, draws up a chair, and sits at her bedside, staring down at her peaceful but bruised face as she continues sleeping. Emily, asleep on her side, wakes, blinks drowsily, rubs her eyes as she slowly comes to, sits up a little, freezes, then sits up fully. She stares down at Ben, slumped back in the chair beside her bed, fast asleep. Removing the oxygen tubes from her nose, Emily watches Ben, then slowly reaches out and caresses the back of one of his hands with her fingertips.",
    "313": "Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before. Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation. When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt. The mailbox. Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway. Mrs. Halpern, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car. Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh burn mark on his stomach. Andrea shakes her head. Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface. Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern. Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away. Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins reading it silently. His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat. Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food. Her boss stares back in aggravation. Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a customer pinches her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably. Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged. Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes. Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question. Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette. Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow. Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan. She turns and runs away. Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly. Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. Evan puts a towel under the door.",
    "1272": "The three friends hang onto the dragon's horny spikes, with Hermione on one side and Ron and Harry on the other as it takes flight, clumsily buffeting rooftops and chimneypots before soaring into the air with the Thames winding far below. The wind ruffles their hair as the dragon flies off, heading west along the river. They soar through clouds towards it, with the dragon's outstretched wings barely moving as the currents of air carry it along. They fly low over the river, and as they plunge deep into the water, Harry sees an image of Voldemort. The dark lord attacks a bank guard, and a finger recoils from a glowing ring, Tom Riddle's scorched diary, and the Horcrux locket as Voldemort spins and Harry surfaces. More images of Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor follow, prompting the dark lord to roar. Harry sees Hogwarts School, a dark-haired woman, and a banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw, followed by the two-handled gold cup as Voldemort frowns, eyes staring, then turns uneasily. After surfacing again, Harry swims towards the shore and all three clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop, where they put on dry clothes. Meanwhile, Voldemort stalks amongst dead bodies in Gringotts Bank and speaks to his snake while the Malfoys stand nearby. Eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake as Griphook lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor, which glows and slowly vanishes. Night falls in snowy Hogsmeade as Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. The three friends run off while Death Eaters scour the village; two search a covered market, looking under stalls and lifting covers while the three fugitives crouch down, out of sight. Hearing the call, the two Death Eaters race from the market, and the trio runs up a set of narrow steps to reach a locked, barred gate. Beckoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to a doorway and enters, with the others following him down a staircase. They enter a stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp, where Ron looks puzzled as Hermione and Ron see a painting on the wall—a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair. Next to it, Hermione spots a mirror and sees Harry's face reflected back at her, noticing the bottom corner of the mirror has a piece missing. She looks surprised and turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror, which shows the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing section of the broken mirror, a bearded man comes in and sets down food and drink. Harry glares at Aberforth, who stares at Harry, then addresses the portrait. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting past trees and bushes as Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixed on the painting.",
    "383": "The scene begins as we top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. It is late, and the supermarket is all but deserted. We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case. His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs while a woman waits with arms folded. The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. A small black-and-white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. The Dude enters and flicks on a light. His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom, the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim, and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. His head is plunged into the toilet. Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. His head is plunged back into the toilet. The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. His head is plunged back in. The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. Looming over him is a strapping blond man. Beyond, in the living room, a young Chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug. He starts peeing on the rug. The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses. The blond man stops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native. The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses. The blond man drops the ball, which pulverizes more tile. The two men look at each other. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them.",
    "1137": "Ron peeks around a corner, and across the street behind him, Harry stands inside a small doorway. A woman in a neat business suit approaches, and Ron pretends to tie his shoelace as Harry casts a spell, causing the woman to faint. Ron helps Harry carry her inside, where they place her beside two unconscious men. Hermione plucks a hair from the woman's head, and they each hold a cup of Polyjuice. Harry morphs into Albert Runcorn, a man with dark hair, peeks out the door, and steps out, followed by Ron as the tall man with auburn hair and a mustache, Reginald Cattermole, and then by Hermione as the businesswoman, Mafalda Hopkirk. Inside, Harry and Ron, minus Hermione, join the men who are standing in lines outside cubicles. An older man pushes past, and Ron enters a cubicle while Harry waits for the next one. Harry enters his cubicle, shuts the door, looks up to see Ron, now Reg, peering over the dividing wall, looks at the pedestal, then at Ron, who frowns. Harry stands on the edge of the toilet, steps onto the bowl, pulls the chain, and is flushed spinning down the loo. He emerges in a green fireplace and steps out into a long tiled corridor, with Ron emerging further back along the corridor. Everyone is walking in the same direction, and Ron and Harry join them. Ahead, Harry sees guards in uniform, and two guards apprehend a man walking behind him. He joins a nervous-looking Hermione, both in their morphed shapes of Mafalda and Albert. A statue shows muggles being crushed, and Ron has joined them as they enter a lift. Yaxley, a Death Eater with a fair pigtail, addresses Ron, then walks away as the gate closes. The lift hurtles backwards, then shoots up, and when the gate slides open, Harry pushes Ron out to stand in a circular atrium. The lift reverses, descends, and two men scuttle across in front of Ron. The gate opens onto Umbridge, who steps in and turns to Harry. With stiff robotic movements, Harry gets out of the lift as the gate closes, then looks round at Hermione while the lift backs away and descends. Harry wanders along a curved corridor, passing a large open-plan office where clerks with wands flick copies of a booklet from their desks into trays. He passes with a herd of minions carrying papers, and an eyeball rotates in a peephole. Harry glances around, drops a small black object onto the floor that develops legs and feet, and it scuttles away, multiplying as it goes. Each one produces a horn and a white up-key on top, and they scatter among the desks in the open-plan office, erupting and causing a diversion.",
    "909": "Farther along the bulletin board, Dillinger finds black and white photos of himself. Others show more buildings, including photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated Tommy guns, which he views after lowering his sunglasses. He crosses to a bulletin board showing mug shots of Billie, and the last mug shot of Dillinger himself remains unstamped. Dillinger lowers his shades and meets his mug shot's stern gaze. As he rounds a corner, he spies a group of agents around the radio, but one man glances over, and unrecognized, Dillinger moves on. In a cinema lobby, a fair-haired agent scans the surroundings while using a public phone, while elsewhere, another agent ends a call and shakes his head looking across the street. At the wheel of a parked car, Madala looks to Purvis, who is seated shotgun. A shaving kit lies open on a small, round table illuminated by a lamp's modest light, with a handgun beside it. Facing a mirror, Dillinger drags a razor down his lathered cheek, finishes shaving, and opens his pocket watch to eye Billie's photo and the time. He shuts the watch, puts it away, and pockets the gun. Parked near the Biograph, Purvis tensely rubs his thin-lipped mouth as a few anonymous patrons mill into the theater at the box office. The agent looks away, shifting his anxious gaze, then gets out of the car and paces down the sidewalk. He stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema as a man arrives with two blonde women, one in a conspicuous orange skirt. Purvis blinks, looks over his shoulder, and spotting the trio, he looks away. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves Anna at her seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly to find adjacent seats as opening titles appear on the screen. In the packed audience, Dillinger stares intently at the screen through his spectacles. Outside, Purvis addresses his agents, pats Winstead's shoulder, and the team splits up. In the movie house, the crowd watches figures on screen playing hockey, followed by Clark Gable washing his hands in a men's room. Another character walks in, and Dillinger gazes at the screen with a boyish smirk as Gable shoots the man. Sitting on her own, Anna turns, peeking nervously over her shoulder, then faces the screen again, her chest heaving. Outside, agents take their positions as Winstead and Hurt duck into a storefront's recessed entryway. In the movie house, Dillinger watches the screen with a furrowed brow while leading lady Myrna Loy stares with her mouth agape. Dillinger gazes at her with a knitted brow and clenched jaw as the exotically pretty actress in a fur-collared coat wears a pensive expression. Later, she shifts her sober gaze and, later still, turns away from a door clad in black.",
    "1257": "On stage, a band who wears seahorses on their heads performs, and Carl turns to look as Allison walks onstage. Carl shakes his head incredulously as Allison plays a keyboard, wearing a spangly mini top hat. Carl stands with his hand on his heart, grins, and gazes at her. She pouts at the crowd, then furrows her brow. Carl sits at the bar with a bottle of beer, and smiling, Allison sashays up beside him. Carl sits at the bar, smiling and waiting as she glances over and beams. He looks down, and later they walk in the middle of a dark street, reach her scooter, and wrinkling her nose, she smiles as they both smile. Carl throws himself into bed and sets an alarm clock, which he then puts on his bedside table and switches off his lamp. He scowls at his phone, answers it, and switches the lamp on again. Early morning joggers stretch in front of a large observatory with three domes as a car races up the hill and comes to a halt. Carl climbs out, cans of energy drinks tumbling out when he opens the door, and he removes a can stuck to his shoe. He runs over, punches the air, bounds off, and sprints down a hill with the others jogging behind. They take snaps on their cameras while Carl leaps onto a bench by a couple hugging, snaps them with his phone, then darts off again. The group jog along a pathway on a hillside and find Carl collapsed on the ground, his eyes closed. Allison squats to start snapping Carl, and everyone else does the same. Allison and Carl stand together at the top of the hill as Carl downs a bottle of water, gasps in air, pretends to write notes, and nods thoughtfully. She slaps him across the arm. Carl and Peter eat in the garden of a restaurant, where Carl downs a glass of water. A Persian woman is present, and Carl picks up a basket that Peter's food was in. Peter stands to kiss Lucy, and they sit while Faranoush beams at her, and Lucy stares, flabbergasted. Norman opens his front door, and they're dressed as Harry, Ron, and Hermione. The others stare as guests play a game of mock Quidditch, and Carl smiles. The first Harry Potter film plays, and Norman gazes at the screen and waves. Carl and Allison stand up to leave, and Carl freezes as the party guests clap. Norman lets them out, and Carl and Allison zoom down a dark street on Allison's scooter, with Carl sitting behind her with his arms around her waist. The scooter wobbles unsteadily as Carl is driving, and he smiles nervously, eyes something on the other side of the street, and grins. Carl and Allison hurry towards a chain-link fence that has a gate which is locked.",

Meanwhile, a group of workers roll a storage crate through a darkened exhibition hall, opening it to reveal a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa which they use to replace the original. A man shines a torch on the hanging replica, highlighting Mona Lisa's mouth. A TV broadcast shows a Mayan temple as Jackson, a handsome, dark-haired man in his 30s, leaps off his couch, rushes into his bathroom to clean his teeth, answers the phone on his way out, silently curses his car, and walks out of the garage. He gets into a stretch limo with dark windows and drives off past the surface, noticing a jagged crack in the road as kids jump over it. Jackson arrives at his ex-wife Kay's house, while in San Francisco Harbor, people on a ship list up and down dramatically. As passengers stumble when the boat's hull crunches into the docks, ship stewards help them up while Harry and his friend Terry scan the area, frowning. Laura wakes up in bed, answers her phone, and in another location, Roland is driving when the back of his car explodes, flipping it forward and engulfing it in flames. Jackson's limo rounds a corner on the way to Yellowstone National Park. Inside the Oval Office, Wilson looks across at Anheuser as Laura enters with a newspaper featuring a story about Roland's death. She turns on the TV, ignoring Adrian, while Wilson eyes Anheuser who gets up to leave, and Adrienne follows before sitting heavily on a sofa. President Wilson sits in front of her, putting his hand over hers. At Yellowstone Park, Jackson drops his daughter Lily's hat over a fence and climbs after it, followed by Lily and her brother Noah along a sparse trail to a clearing with a parched lake basin. They head down to the cordoned-off, bubbly, marshy basin surrounded by big tripods, and approach a dead, rotting stag. Someone amongst the trees on a hillside watches them through binoculars, with steam rising from the lake bed around Jackson as he takes his kids' hands and a convoy arrives in front of him. The watcher in the trees is a man named Charlie Frost.",
    "367": "Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit and loads a silver bullet just as Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off and rolls to his feet. The hell hound squares back on its haunches, growling and ready for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear and aims the revolver at the dog, but at the last moment, Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom fires, and the bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down. The carnies gasp as the dog, licking its chops, approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon. He finds only a small stick and waves it at the dog, ready to strike it. Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes, and it bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch. Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can, and the dog bounds after it, returning a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet, its tail whipping back and forth. Edward throws the stick again, and the dog takes off in a new direction. Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods, and the still-spry dog goes after it. It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned, so he follows it into the woods, finding Amos Calloway standing up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy, with the stick in his mouth. Amos takes the stick out as Edward approaches, and Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates, then Edward walks away and starts running, as he has to get there as soon as possible. Meanwhile, Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot. The scene descends on the main quad, finding Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain, then changing out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package. It's the mid-1960s, but by the conservative dress of the passing students, it could be any era. Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half-open door, through which we can see the edge of a young woman, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. Finally, a decision is reached, and the door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton, who is effortlessly beautiful, pure, and simple as sunlight. He can't believe he's finally reached her and half-laughs, nervous, which makes her laugh, not sure what's going on. Sandra is overwhelmed and all she can finally think of to say is put her hand on the door frame, where we see a diamond on her left ring finger. Watching Sandra, Edward's heart falls 20 floors, but he tries to suppress the reaction and put on a brave front.",
    "27": "At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a torrid sky. The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow, twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native quarter. The narrator's voice fades away. A police officer takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads. An officer blows his whistle several times. There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people. A police car, full of officers, with siren blaring, screams through the street and stops in the market. Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into a police wagon. At a street corner, two policemen stop a white civilian and question him. The civilian pats his pockets and brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them. Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly down the street. Jan and Annina Brandel, a very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an unfamiliar and hectic world. A shot rings out, and the man falls to the ground. The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds Free French literature. A European man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English couple more closely than the scene on the street. A middle-aged English couple sit at a table just off the square and observe the commotion across the way in front of the Palais de Justice. The European walks over to the couple. The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people stream out. Suspects are herded out of the van and into the Palais de Justice. At the entrance, the arrested suspects are led in by the police. He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman and reaches behind the man with his right hand. The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern. As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes there is something missing. The plane swoops down past a sign atop a building at the edge of the airport. As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard. In the group is Captain Louis Renault, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition.",
    "1011": "The Queen stares at the stag, transfixed, as it lowers its head to eat some grass. She continues to stare, then looks to her right and back at the still stag. The Queen turns again to her right and then back to the stag, which has vanished from sight, breaking into a smile as she casts her gaze skyward and dabs tears with a handkerchief, wiping her nose. Later, Tony stands before a mirror, putting on a tie, while video footage shows the ground covered with flowers and members of the public gathered around an arrangement of candles. Tony is then seen addressing some members of the public. As the Queen sits watching TV, Prince Philip enters, and the Queen looks from him to the TV. She gets in bed, removes her spectacles, and Prince Philip climbs in next to her. On Thursday, Tony sits in bed watching TV. Newspapers are strewn over the Queen's bed as she removes her spectacles, wearing a worried expression, and Tony raises his eyebrows. Outside Balmoral, the Queen walks with Corgis, later walking back with them running after her. Entering the kitchen, the staff stop working and leave as a servant places a phone on a table, which the Queen stares at for a moment. Later, in the kitchen, she sits back and tugs at her scarf, and Robin enters behind her. In a corridor at Balmoral, the Queen paces outside a door while the Queen Mother stands up, and they walk in the garden together, with the Queen stopping for a moment. Later, the Queen sits on a sofa in the study, sipping a glass of iced single malt, as a gillie on the misty hills hands a mobile phone to Prince Philip. Charles enters the study as the Queen sits on the sofa with her back to him; he turns and leaves, and the Queen remains seated. The gates of Balmoral are opened by two men, and Range Rovers emerge, flanked by bodyguards.

    "1071": "She runs down the pier as the boat draws alongside. Nullah and Sarah peer through the smoke. The boy stands up on the prow of the boat and grins. He jumps up and down excitedly and runs off the boat onto the jetty. He runs up the wooden steps to the upper level of the wharf and sprints through the smoke towards Sarah. Nullah points and she turns slowly. There in the smoke stands the Drover. Their eyes meet and they walk slowly towards one another. Drover frowns in disbelief, then smiles and they embrace. They cling to each other, tears running down their cheeks. They break apart and look joyfully at one another, then kiss. Nullah runs up and hugs them both. Drover grins happily. The army sergeant sounds the horn of his truck and smiles. Dutton stops and stares at Sarah, Drover, and the boys. He's taken aback by her hug. The sergeant stomps up to the young priest. Fletcher grimly watches the boys, streaming towards the trucks. Sarah rests her head on Drover's shoulder and caresses his cheek. Dutton turns to them. Dutton smiles tearfully. He nods and walks away. Fletcher strides angrily towards the truck the boys are getting into. Dutton's the last on. The tailgate is raised and the trucks head off. Fletcher runs through the devastation, watched from the water tower by King George. Sarah's walking with Nullah. King George looks in horror as Fletcher grabs Bull's rifle. King George raises his arms in his magic-man stance as Fletcher advances with the rifle. King George watches Fletcher closely. Sarah smiles as Nullah runs towards the pub. Fletcher stands on top of a pile of wreckage and aims the rifle. Sarah spots the danger and, at the pub, Drover sees Fletcher. Drover runs for the boy. King George pulls a pipe off the water tower. Fletcher grimaces and Drover falls to the ground with Nullah. King George's pipe has run Fletcher through like a spear. King George glares at him. Drover strokes his hair. The unconscious boy's eyes flicker. Nullah grins. Fletcher tries to aim the rifle at King George. Fletcher winces and drops the rifle. Sarah reaches Drover and Nullah. Fletcher tries to speak and then collapses over a piece of wreckage. Sarah cuddles Nullah. Sergeant Callahan checks Fletcher's pulse. Sarah and Drover gaze into each other's eyes. They kiss, tenderly. Callahan walks away from Fletcher's body, across the wrecked King Carney cattle pen. Smoke hangs in palls over the destruction of Darwin. Drover drives the car in the sunshine, with Sarah and Nullah asleep next to him. Sarah picks up kindling for a fire in a field next to a river. She straightens and stares.",
    "186": "Annie's car pulls away. Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street, and Brackett smiles as Loomis approaches. As they talk, the camera slowly moves around them, revealing a view of the street as Loomis' station wagon moves by. Through the blowing trees, the full moon rises in the night sky. Annie's car moves down a quiet residential street and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from the street: the Doyle house. From the front seat of the station wagon, we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye, and walk up to the Doyle house. Annie's car then makes a wide U-turn and starts down the other direction, with the station wagon pulling forward to follow her. Annie stops three houses down and pulls into a garage, while the station wagon stops several feet away. The shape gets out of the station wagon, staying close to the camera, obscuring himself from view, and glances down the street as gusts of wind blow the costumes of children going house to house. The shape moves, and the camera tracks behind him as he walks toward the Wallace house, stopping in front as Annie comes out of the garage and walks to another two-story frame house: the Wallaces'. The front door opens, and through the front room windows, we see Annie talking to the Wallaces as they put on their coats. The camera and shape quickly move behind a tree to hide from sight. The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage as the shape steps out from behind the tree and stares at the house. Annie and Lindsey Wallace, a pretty little nine-year-old, stand in the doorway framed by the hall light. Annie closes the door. A police car pulls up in front of the Myers house amid the sounds of wind and chirping crickets. Brackett and Loomis get out and stand by the front gate. Inside, Annie turns on the TV, goes to the mirror on the wall, and begins to brush her hair. Looking down the side of the house, Loomis and Brackett walk up to the front porch. A broken, rusted rain gutter clangs back and forth against the house in the wind as the front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in the doorway of a totally dark house. Brackett's flashlight comes on, illuminating the two men as they move through the house, with the camera tracking them. Suddenly, Brackett stops and trains his flashlight on a small object in the corner of the room. For a moment, Brackett doesn't speak.",
    "620": "He slows down in front of one house with a triple garage and box tree on the front lawn and pulls up onto the driveway. As the woman carefully adjusts the buttons on her pristine white cuffs, Mac and Juno, wearing everyday casual clothes, stroll up to the double-fronted door flanked by two slim furs. Mac wipes his feet on the doormat. The woman with neatly combed long dark hair opens the door with a bright smile. Juno slaps Gerta's profit hand. Vanessa purses her lips. Vanessa looks penetratingly at Juno. On the staircase, Juno, in her loose checked shirt over jeans, passes a lineup of post photos of Mark and Vanessa in white. She wanders into Vanessa's en suite bathroom and contemplates herself in the large mirror above the basin, smoothing the front of her hair. There are several expensive-looking bottles and jars grouped around the basin, next to a white orchid in a pot. Opening one jar, she scoops out a finger full of cream and dabs it on her face. Then she does a bodybuilder-type snarl and pose. Picking up a bottle of perfume, she sniffs it and sprays her wrist, rubbing it against the other wrist. As she comes out of the bathroom, she collides with Mark. Her eye lights on the guitar. Mac points to some apparatus. Vanessa smiles proudly. Mac's attempted conversation is met with a baffled look. Then, he and both women look up towards the sound drifting down from the floor above. With a brittle smile, tall slim Vanessa hurries upstairs to find Mark and Juno duetting on guitars. Mac is looking at some forms. Mark closes the front door with a wry smile. Vanessa presses her hands together as if in prayer and lets him fold her in his arms. Vijay speeds up, leaving Bleeker alone on the running track. Two boys pass him as he slows to a walk. At school, a grey-head starkly built woman in a mauve cardigan sits behind the desk, looking disapprovingly at Juno bulging. The woman grudgingly signs a pink form and hands it to Juno. Juno smiles sweetly and comes out into the corridor. A technician spreads gel across Juno's distended belly with an ultrasound scan head. On a monitor next to her, Juno watches moving patches of light and dark take on a recognizable shape. Leah and Bren sigh with delight. Bren's lips tighten. With a look that could kill, the ultrasound technician leaves the room. In her room, with its walls covered in drawings, Juno lies on her bed, her legs propped up on cushions, gazing at the ultrasound print. She blinks thoughtfully and moments later is driving Mac's blue Previa out to Glacial Valley estate past its immaculate houses and lawns blanketed in snow.",
    "626": "Holding the knife at belly level, he twists the long wide blade until he's looking at his own reflection in the polished steel. Glancing up, he reaches forward and positions the knife at a downward sloping angle at the base of the door. Turning the knife in different directions, cans, bottles, and boxes of food are reflected in the blade. Graham withdraws the knife and puts it down on the floor beside him. Then, frustrating himself on his belly, he makes to look under the door again. Having second thoughts, he grabs the knife and kneels up, setting the knife back down on the worktop. He rises to his feet and, head bowed, strides determinedly out into the hallway. Stopping in his tracks, Graham turns and marches back in, seizing the knife. He lies on his stomach by the pantry door. A clawed hand shoots out from under the door. Startled, Graham bangs his head and drops the knife. Retrieving the knife, Graham slices off the creature's fingers. Startled, the flock of birds springs from the maize fields, scattering and flying away. Later, Graham returns to the farmhouse, locking the door behind him, hurriedly checks the handle, then walks off past the open living room door. He stops dead and stares, seeing Bo, Morgan, and now Merrill on the sofa wearing silver foil cone hats. Without flinching, Graham turns stiffly and goes to sit on the stairs. Merrill sits still with his hands on his knees. Graham links his hands together. Merrill turns to Morgan. Graham makes a pained frown. Putting one hand on the post at the bottom of the stairs, Graham pulls himself wearily up and plods into the living room, moving up to the sofa. Bo holds up one arm. Graham does the same. Morgan and Merrill raise their arms. Graham eyes them uncertainly. All three. Merrill and Bo lower their arms, Morgan settles himself back down on the sofa. Graham hesitates a moment then steps forward, and sits beside his son on the end of the couch. Morgan peers up at his father. Merrill stares blankly ahead. He sighs. Now, in broad daylight, Merrill leaves his converted barn holding a large white cotton sack. A cigarette in one hand, he jogs down the grey-painted wooden stairs on the side of the building then trudges across the lawn towards the farmhouse. As he takes a drag on the cigarette, his attention is drawn to the field of maize. Merrill throws the cigarette butt to the ground, then slows to a gradual stop. Dumping the cotton sack, he reaches down, picks up a stone, and launches it into the field of maize. He stands immobile, watching the crop with anxious expectation.",
    "220": "Delmar whistles appreciatively and lurches threateningly to his feet as Everett scrambles up, watching the white-robed people following in the wake of the tenor. There are more and more white robes drifting through the woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men. The endless stream now drifts through the foreground, the background, and the campsite itself. We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground who stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man back-down into the water. Behind him, a line of robed singers lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods. Pete, Delmar, and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down at the river as white-robed people continue to drift past them. Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line, and reaches the minister, holding his nose as the minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water. Nearby, a smoldering twig fire burns while a bloodhound on a leash circles into frame, its tail fiercely wagging. We follow it as it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan pomade, nose to the ground and straining against its leash. Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile, while Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both dripping wet. He shakes his head and laughs as a thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. The man grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and trots up to the open window. Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls out, and Tommy shrugs, causing Everett's eyes to narrow as he studies the man. The car pulls into the parking lot of a single-story cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a handpainted sign. As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders and strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears dark glasses and holds a white cane. Everett grimaces, thinking, as the three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, who plays his guitar into a can microphone, performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. When they finish, Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back just as a caravan of two oversize cars pulls into the lot, and Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station door, whooping it up. A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly gets out of the first car, as Delmar waves a fistful of money at him. A big shambling man of about thirty follows him out of the car.",
    "298": "Stella takes a handful of oil and slaps it on Jeff's back, and he winces. She hits him with some more cold oil, and he winces again. Jeff gives an exasperated look. The camera pulls back as she helps Jeff to a sitting position, and he buttons on his shirt. The camera moves in as she helps him into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. He stops as he notices her attitude. Jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady and the man with the flowers. The elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face covered with the Herald Tribune. Jeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window, where dreamily and methodically, she is brushing her long copper-colored hair. She is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror. His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left, where a shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker, is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. He hands a key to the young man and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied but agreeable nod, then departs. We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. Then slowly and significantly, she looks toward the open window. They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pulls down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat. There is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now standing behind him. He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her. The camera makes a short sweep around the neighborhood showing that some of the rooms are now with their lights on.",
    "856": "A car comes from the opposite direction of a swarm of flies and screeches off the road towards a diner. Charlie sees it from a window and runs outside as the others watch the car stop. Jeep spots Charlie, and the door opens with Michael stepping out. He sees Charlie, clutching her belly, running towards him as Jeep runs beside her. Charlie slows down while Michael stares at her. Michael opens his mouth, teeth clenched, while Bob keeps a pump-action shotgun aimed at him. Michael sees a body, tilts his head, and snatches the pump-action from Bob. Kyle points his pistol as Michael holds the shotgun at Bob's forehead, causing Bob to close his eyes tightly. Percy comes outside, and Bob screws up his face as Michael keeps the shotgun in place. Jeep and Charlie watch transfixed. Michael takes his left hand off the barrel, keeps the right holding the shotgun, and then hands Bob the gun. Michael goes to the car's boot, opens it, and takes out assault rifles, handing them to Kyle, Bob, and Jeep. He rushes past Jeep and Bob, heads to Charlie, and hands her a pistol. Charlie watches him stride towards the diner as Audrey and Sandra come out. The wind rises, blowing dust around. Bob stares down the road and then moves as Jeep keeps his eyes on the road and runs to the diner. Inside, they barricade the doors; Jeep pushes an office desk against the back door, and Kyle looks out through blinds. Michael picks up an assault rifle and stands beside Jeep, casting a nervous glance at him. The lights go out, and a torchlight beam illuminates the diner with Bob shining one at Michael, who looks up at the ceiling. Bob leads the way through a skylight to a metal ladder and steps onto a metal walkway in front of the diner's unlit neon sign, with Percy, Kyle, and Michael accompanying him. They see a light in the distance, which turns out to be an ice cream van. Kyle and Bob turn to Percy, who steadies a rifle with his metallic hand. As the van approaches, in the diner, Audrey peeps out through the blinds, and Jeep is there with a big torch. The Frosty Treats ice cream van pulls into the forecourt and stops. Audrey joins her mom on the floor beside Howard, while Charlie ducks behind the counter with the pistol Michael gave her, and Jeep stays close by. The others on the roof watch as the driver gets out, revealing two long, bony hands clinging to the door frame as the ice cream man with a blue forage cap emerges.",
    "1383": "Sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises, turns back, and slowly draws his wand. Then he sees it—something big, darker than the shadows which conceal it, with wide, gleaming. Harry steps back, afraid to look, his wand outstretched, and he trips, tumbling over the forgotten trunk. The tip of his wand blazes; bang! Twin beams of blinding light spear the night. Stan eyes Harry suspiciously and nods slowly. As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows across the street—now simply shadows—and climbs aboard. Inside are only beds. In one bed, a disheveled wizard grunts and turns over in his sleep. Bang! Ernie rockets away, and the beds as one slide six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed nearest him and peers up at the chandelier swaying directly above his head. Beyond the windscreen, oncoming traffic whips past in a blur. Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, then disappears once more. Stan grins with sinister delight, showing bad teeth, as the Shrunken Head cackles with delight and Harry peers out the windscreen, watching London careering by. Sure enough, directly ahead, a little old lady is crossing the street. Ernie hits the brakes hard, and Harry flies forward, palms to the window; the brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and Harry flies back onto his bed. Bang! The bus rockets forward once more. As Harry rights himself, he notices the headline of Stan's Daily Prophet: Escape from Azkaban! Below it, a sunken-faced man with long, matted hair glowers from a moving photograph. Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face. Harry nods, and as he does, Black's eyes shift. Just then, a pair of double-decker buses sweep directly toward the Knight Bus. Before he can scream, the entire Knight Bus squeezes down and shoots the gap between the two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces. As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are revealed; Harry glances up and reads the sign above: The Leaky Cauldron. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then pauses, and with a flick of his wand, silences the car alarm. Harry trails Tom through the quiet room, where the bartender glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A solitary wizard reads a book while, at his elbow, his coffee cup stirs itself. Tom leads Harry upstairs, and as Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a snow-white owl (Hedwig) perched atop a chair. Harry turns and finds a pinstriped silhouette (Cornelius Fudge) at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of walnuts from his pocket, and—crack—crushes the shells between his palms.",
    "400": "Fergus enters with a tray and some breakfast, where Maguire is sitting stock-still, and Maguire shakes his head twice and looks hard at him before rising and dragging Fergus out the door. Maguire then goes back to the house where Jody is sitting with the hood on again as Fergus enters without saying anything. Fergus takes a plate, brings it toward Jody, lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth, and begins to feed him, saying nothing and shaking his head before feeding himself and then feeding more to Jody. Jody chuckles under his hood as Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood, causing Jody to smile up at him and Fergus to laugh. She pulls the hood down over him and whacks him with a pistol, after which Fergus lifts the hood a bit to reveal Jody's mouth bleeding and looks moved. Fergus walks toward him, their faces close as he searches for her picture. The door opens to reveal Maguire with another man, and Fergus turns toward them. Fergus walks toward Maguire, and the other man walks forward and takes his seat, with Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and others around. Maguire lights a cigarette, and Fergus looks at him and nods, then turns back as Fergus leaves. Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody, who begins to laugh under the hood. Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke while Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips, and then Jody coughs but keeps the cigarette in his lips. Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth, remaining silent with wet eyes as the farmhouse is covered in mist. Maguire opens the greenhouse door and clicks the chamber of his gun while Fergus has a gun in his hand. Fergus takes Jody, with his hands tied behind his back, by the elbow, and Jody rises as Fergus leads him through the door past Maguire. Fergus turns with sudden fierceness and pulls Jody through the fields, pushing him through a copse of trees with the gun at his back, and then pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him with a cut lip from where Jude struck him and is prodded on by Fergus with the gun; Jody stumbles forward while Fergus is cold and businesslike. Jody suddenly sprints, loosens the ties on his hands, frees them, and runs off like a hare, causing Fergus to scream in fury after him, aim, change his mind, and run. Fergus gains on him, stretches his arm out, but Jody sprints ahead again as if playing with him, laughing in exhilaration as Fergus pants behind him, wheezing and almost laughing.",
    "577": "She is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, and conflicted, experiencing an instant and wide spectrum of emotions. Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction. Joe hears Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer. Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy. Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, and stops, then pivots and follows Parrish out the proper door. Parrish turns back to the bedroom. Joe tests the springs. Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly, and Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff. A spectacular indoor Olympic pool with a window commands views of the skyline. Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit, and Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. He observes her, but she is unaware of him; however, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, and she aborts her lap, looking up to see who it is. Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, and points to a stack of towels. Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter; he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, so he implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands, and presents it to Susan. Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter until he finishes the spoonful. He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, and realizes this is inappropriate. Susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it, and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels. She watches, fascinated, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful. Parrish regards Joe, noticing the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone. Parrish is startled and regards Joe carefully. Silence follows as Joe considers the point, and Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and begins tying it for him. He completes the tying of Joe's tie with some difficulty, adjusts it beautifully on Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror. Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken. They stride on, cutting through the crowd, with Joe all at home in his new surroundings, but Parrish just the opposite, uncharacteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out. Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room. Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for the doorknob, and enters, with Joe following right behind him.",
    "261": "Similarly producing a long wooden match, biting down on the cigar, and dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar, the match erupts into roaring flame, crackling as it is lit, from the inside of the office. The name on the pebbled glass is a backwards Nathan Arizona. There is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled voices. The door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle-aged secretary hanging at his elbow. Nathan is staring toward his desk where the Biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily on the desk. His head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement in the air in front of him. Eyes on the Biker, Nathan slams the door shut behind him, looking for some reaction, but the Biker still does not react to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance. His eyes continue to follow some phantom movement, and when the Biker speaks, it is still without looking at Nathan, and in a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner. He takes a drag on his cigar. SMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head, while Nathan is looking at him stonily. Quick as a flash, the heretofore languid Smalls bolts forward, his fist stopped an inch short of Nathan's nose, his index finger and thumb pinched together, holding the leg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the air. He flicks the fly away, and Nathan stares grimly at Smalls then swivels to punch numbers on a telephone. Nathan swivels back, looking up, and his speech stops short. The office is empty. A whipcrack effect builds to the cut, and he has been slumped over the kitchen table, asleep. Hi looks up as Gale and Evelle are smiling down at him. Hi takes the envelope that he was slumped over, with \"to Ed\" written on its face. There is a harsh knock at the door and all three tense. Hi is staring as the knock comes again. He goes to the door, pulls back its shade, and peeks out, looking at Glen evenly. Hi is suddenly nervous and urgent, taking one step down and holding out a calming hand as Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon, while Hi stops short. Glen smiles, spits on the dirt in front of him, and Hi's face is set in rigid dismay as Glen gets into his car, slams the door, and the car squeals off. Hi looks back at the trailer as a slat in the window blind drops back into place. He opens the door as Evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms.",
    "430": "Eddie walks over to the water cooler, and his face is buried in his lap as Charlie massages his back. Behind him, in the washroom, is Fats, washing his face and hands. Charlie gets Eddie a bottle, while Bert and Henry watch Eddie coldly. A drunken, exhausted Eddie nods, looks up at Bert, grins maliciously, and takes a drink. Charlie starts to put away Eddie’s cue stick. Fats emerges from the washroom, dries his hands, and looks at Eddie and then at Bert, who nods. Henry helps Fats into the jacket with the carnation still in the lapel, and Eddie grins at this. So does Bert. Fats opens his palms for the sprinkling of the talcum powder, rubs his hands together, then takes out his cigarette case. Bert smiles in appreciation. Eddie grabs the leather case out of Charlie’s hands, rises, and confronts Fats almost scornfully, then looks down at his own dirty, disheveled shirt. He and a smiling Bert exchange glances as Eddie moves to put on his jacket. Charlie confronts him, and Eddie puts a bottle into the pocket of his jacket and returns to the table to screw together his cue stick. The sight of Fats makes him laugh again, and everyone stares at Eddie as he scratches his head, alone with his private joke. Eddie abruptly tosses his cue case away, and a worried Charlie picks up the case and stands by mutely, watching Eddie disintegrate. Eddie leans over to shoot, then turns away, laughing loudly to himself, while Fats watches him soberly, patiently. From a high angle, Fats is shooting, and Eddie is asleep on a stool against a wall, with even Bert dozing. The shots go in, and Eddie bangs his head against the wall, knocking over a bottle as he tries to get up off the stool. The noise startles him, and Charlie watches sadly. Eddie gropes through his pockets and comes up with a few crumpled bills. Fats rises and tosses his cue on the table, and Willie gives him the stake money. Fats confronts Eddie, steps by him, and heads for the coat rack, slapping the stake money into Bert’s hand as he goes by. Bert returns the money to his billfold, wordlessly. The blinds are drawn and the light strikes Eddie in the eyes, but still he stumbles after Fats, holding his money out before him, pleading. He bangs against the corner of the table and falls onto the floor. Fats hears him go down and pauses, turning to see Charlie rush to Eddie’s side. After a moment, Fats continues on toward the door. Charlie slaps Eddie’s cheeks as Bert, Sausage, Willie, and Preach step around the body on their way out. Eddie is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, the crashing of pool balls sounding in his head.",
    "760": "The boy's mouth turns down, and he sulks silently, staring blankly ahead. Behind him, the door opens, and a woman enters. She pauses, hands on hips, then walks towards him. They are both reflected in the curved screen of an old TV, so the edges of the room look distorted. She stands beside him, arms folded. The woman crouches beside the boy, looking into his face. The boy turns and looks at her. She stands and folds her arms again. He's hunched forward, head down. The boy lifts his head. The boy goes to the window. Outside in the sunshine, children are playing in a park with a high chain-link fence. An oblong box with purple wrapping is propped on the seat of a bench facing him. Children chase past the bench, as the boy walks slowly towards it, holding on to the fencing for support as he negotiates the two steps down into the park. He sits on the bench and picks up the purple package with his good right hand, undoes the white ribbon around it, and tears at the paper. Inside is a brown cardboard box. The boy pulls off the lid, folds back purple tissue paper, and stares down. In the box is a comic, upside down. Very carefully, the boy turns the comic around on its bed of purple tissue. The cover features a heroic figure in a yellow cape fighting a powerfully built creature, half-man, half-beast, against a backdrop of New York skyscrapers. The woman sits gently beside the boy. The boy continues to stare down at the comic. She looks away and back at him. He glances up at her for a moment. As he looks down again, the words and colors fade, leaving a more detailed black and white version of the comic cover. The dark-haired young man in a suit and tie, whose face is reflected in the glass over the drawing, nods. The young man grins. Elijah limps across the gallery using a cane. Elijah turns back to stare at the man. As he does, David strides towards the gallery with Joseph a few paces behind. Inside, Elijah is walking away from the door and doesn't look around. Elijah turns. They're sitting in an office. Joseph gazes up at his father. Joseph looks from David to Elijah, then gets up and goes. Elijah, in a shimmering, purple, silk suit, gazes at David. David looks around as Joseph returns. David is sitting up on a bed, a pillow behind his head, reading the paper. Joseph is asleep, lying across him, his head on David's chest, one arm flung around him. David lowers the paper and glances at his son. He closes the paper and very carefully slides out from under the sleeping boy.",
    "357": "Aragorn and Arwen look on Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin as they stand before them. The four hobbits, dressed in their old clothes, clean and mended, bow their heads. Aragorn raises his hand and drops on one knee, kneeling before the hobbits, his head bowed, followed by all assembled there. Tears spring into Frodo's eyes as he clutches Sam's shoulder, and 4000 people pay homage to the courage of two little hobbits from the Shire. The camera rises into the air away from the crowded citadel until Minas Tirith becomes a speck in the landscape, dissolving into the parchment map of Middle-earth, slowly drifting across the map towards the west, revealing Hobbiton bathed in a warm sunset as Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin ride into shot on ponies, past Odo Proudfoot who shakes his head at the strangeness of their appearance. Frodo brings a round of drinks to the table, and nearby, a huge fuss is being made of a large pumpkin which has been brought in to be shown off. The four friends look at each other, a world of experience now separates them from their fellow hobbits. Seated at a long table, the four friends raise their glasses. Sam's eye is suddenly caught by Rosie Cotton who is serving behind the bar. Sam steels himself and leaves to go and talk to Rosie. Frodo, Merry, and Pippin exchange smiles as on a beautiful sunny day, Sam and Rosie are married, with their dearest friends gathered around them. Rosie throws a beautiful bouquet of flowers, and it's caught by Pippin who smiles in embarrassment. Frodo walks through Bag End to his study, hunched over a desk, to reveal Bilbo's red book open on Frodo's desk. He is writing in the last chapters in careful neat handwriting. Frodo turns back the pages, revealing: There and Back Again -- A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. He writes below it as Sam Gamgee calls out from the door. Frodo winces with a sharp gasp of pain, puts the pen down, and clutches at his shoulder. Sam has entered the room and stands behind Frodo. He is drawn and pale, and Sam is at a loss for words. On a cold winter's morning, out of the fog rattles a small covered wagon; Gandalf is at the reins. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are waiting on ponies for the wagon, all wearing their grey elven robes. Gandalf arrives in his cart, and the wagon trundles along at a sedate pace. Sam, Merry, and Pippin ride behind, leading Frodo's empty pony. Frodo is sitting in the wagon with his arm around his uncle Bilbo. Bilbo is extremely old and frail, dozing, his head slumped, and Bilbo's eyes flutter open.",
    "849": "The possessed clamber and crawl over the van, scratching the windscreen with their fingernails. Charlie picks up a machine pistol, but Michael stops her, takes the machine pistol, and picks up an assault rifle. Bob and Jeep pull the planks away from the door and open it as Michael walks out, guns blazing, causing the possessed to drop dead. A couple run at Michael, and he batters them away, then pulls out two pistols and shoots more. He gives another one a kick, shoots him, and lays into a couple more by the van. Michael takes a nozzle from a fuel pump, sprays gas over the back of the van, and lights it, causing the possessed to flee as the van is engulfed in flames. Inside, Audrey cowers fearfully and moves over to the passenger seat as Michael smashes the driver's window, grabs her hand, yanks her out, and they run off before the van blows up, throwing them into the diner. Charlie fills a jug with water and turns to see the boy, causing her to drop the jug as he slashes the front of her shirt with a big kitchen knife. Charlie recoils and holds up a metal tray as the boy stabs at her, and the knife sticks in the tray. His hands slide down the blade, and the knife drops to the floor as the boy stares at his bloody hands. Charlie lowers the tray and kicks him over as Michael clambers in front of her and aims his gun, but the boy has disappeared. The lights go out, plunging the place into darkness, and Michael runs over to where the boy was. Bob and Jeep come over, shining a torch on the ground, revealing a trail of blood. Jeep aims his torch beam up, following a trail of bloody handprints across the ceiling until the trail stops dead. The boy appears behind Bob and tries to throttle him, but Michael grabs the boy and hurls him away, and Jeep shoots him. Charlie bends forward, grimacing, as Michael stares at him and holds Charlie's hands, with Audrey at them both. Bob steps out onto the roof to join Jeep as Michael keeps holding Charlie, her mouth gaping. The building shakes, and up on the roof, Bob and Jeep stare out into the darkness as bright light flashes all around, illuminating hundreds of possessed standing motionless, staring at the diner. Charlie's mouth gapes as Audrey gently lifts the baby, smiling incredulously, wrapping the bloody child in a towel, and offering it to Charlie. A tear rolls down Charlie's cheek as she faces away from the child. Audrey carries the baby over to Sandra, who stares at it, frowning, but then smiles and nods. Behind her back, Sandra twists her hands within the ropes bound around them as Audrey and Michael exchange a look, and he shakes his head. Sitting behind Charlie, Michael leans to her with a sincere expression.",
    "485": "Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. The camera follows her to the window, and once there, we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom, and the voice is coming from that room. Mary stands by the window, listening with mounting distress, concern, and sympathy. She turns her face away, gazing sadly at the little empty room, then turns to look out the window. We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray. Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it, and goes out onto the porch. Mary pauses outside the door, about to start forward when Norman comes around the building, walks along the porch past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye. She begins to back into her room, and Norman starts to follow but hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns and hurries to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows. Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper. He turns and sees Mary standing in the doorway. As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She notices the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone. Finally, Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, and looks at the spread. Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, and nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied. Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles, and then laughs. Mary looks at him, with some compression, and smiles. Norman turns slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness. The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. Mary watches the troubled man, almost physically pained by his anguish. She goes out of the parlor. We see her from Norman's viewpoint as she crosses the small office and goes out into the night. He goes into the office and looks at the book. He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. Norman turns his ear from the direction of the sounds, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.",
    "1131": "Lying on the ground, Ron lowers his head as Scabior scrutinizes Harry's disfigured face; Harry's face is bloated, and his right eye is closed. Scabior grips Harry's collar as they walk the path towards the Malfoy Manor house. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate, with Hermione and Ron close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange waits eagerly behind the iron gate as Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys and looks expectantly at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back and points at Hermione when she spots the Sword of Gryffindor held by a Snatcher. Bellatrix is hurled backwards as her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck, and a whip coils around Scabior, dragging him along the floor as Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron, and Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars as a figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar, and Ron's deluminator lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor as Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the wand-maker, is present, and Harry holds the piece of broken mirror, looking into it and seeing someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns, pointing his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander. Griphook walks towards the gate, looks back, then climbs the stairs. Ron flicks on the deluminator, and as the light returns, a small figure apparates. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander and takes their hands; the three disapparate. The cellar is dark, and Wormtail opens the gate but is struck from behind and falls on his face. Dobby waits holding Wormtail's wand, and the Snitch flies to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. A strand of hair falls onto Hermione's coat as Bellatrix cuts Griphook with a dagger and looks down at Hermione. Ron has a wand, and Harry catches Bellatrix's wand and aims at Lucius. Bellatrix has Hermione, holding a dagger at her throat while grinning. Harry's back to normal as Lucius glares at Draco, who freezes, and with a sneer, his father pulls up his own shirt sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark tattoo on his arm. Lucius raises his right hand, about to lay it on the mark, as Bellatrix presses the dagger against Hermione's throat. They all look up as high above, Dobby unscrews a chandelier. Hermione runs into Ron's arms, and Harry snatches the wands from Draco and stuns Lucius, also magicking Narcissa's wand away. Dobby stands on a balustrade, his arms outstretched, and the trio and Griphook with the Sword of Gryffindor grab hold of him. Bellatrix flings her dagger towards them as they disapparate, and the dagger vanishes with them.",
    "542": "Thunder explodes in the distance as lightning flashes, while the Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of a formidable stone castle. Indy reaches into the back seat to retrieve his bullwhip, and he glances up at Elsa's beret, which she adjusts. A butler walks to the door and opens it to reveal Indy and Elsa standing outside in the rain, with Elsa now wearing Indy's fedora and Indy wearing Elsa's beret. Indy, followed by Elsa, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat, and as he does so, he pushes past the startled butler, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. Elsa follows, taking off her coat, while Indy sneezes hard and dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as Elsa looks on in amused amazement. The butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, unconscious. Indy and Elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway, creeping past a room full of Nazi soldiers who are working around a large table with a map atop it, and Indy reacts to the sight of them. Indy and Elsa continue down the hallway, with Indy carrying a gun in his hand and his whip hanging from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens, then points out an electrical wire, studies the situation for a moment, and decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the door, but there is no response, so he looks back at Elsa and enters. The room is dark and empty, and Indy throws open the window shutters to look out at the rain coming down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window, but below that is a sheer drop. Indy leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. He swings from the window to a stone gargoyle and then takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet, and swings toward a shuttered window with his feet extended, crashing through the wooden shutters as a clap of thunder disguises the noise. Indy crashes through the shutters and glass into the room, stunned and sinking to one knee as his father, Professor Henry Jones, steps out of the shadows. Indy gets to his feet, and now they look at each other, pressing themselves against the wall, with Henry still holding a broken vase in his hand. Indy steps to the window and looks down while Henry moves to a lamp to hold the vase under the light for a closer look, all the while focused on the broken vase.",
    "1229": "A square of his chest is bare beneath a sheet as Emily is wheeled down a hospital corridor on a gurney. Dr. Briar comes to see her in an operating room, and Dan weeps. A surgeon lifts Tim's heart out of his body and carefully passes it to a colleague. Dr. Briar and her colleagues are operating on Emily as a medic opens the door of the operating room to let in another medic who is carrying Tim's heart in a stainless steel bowl. Emily, anesthetized and wearing a theater cap, lies on the operating table. There is a golden, dream-like image of Emily and Tim sitting in the shade of the tree and entwining their fingers. Emily's new heart lies still in the open cavity of her chest while Dr. Briar looks up at the monitor, which is flat-lining. The heart begins to beat, and Emily lies peacefully on the operating table, eyes closed. The real Ben sits miserably in Tim's motel room, staring at a wall of newspaper cuttings about the crash. There are also photos of the people Tim helped and an article on Ezra. Ben sifts through envelopes, each of which has the name of a person Tim wanted to help, including Ben's. Ben hands Emily a list of the people written on the back of a photo of Sarah and a photo showing Tim standing at Holly's hospital bedside. In her garden, Emily weeps as she reads Tim's letter to her. Glum and pensive, Emily lies in a bathtub, and her head and shoulders are framed by the water. Emily slowly submerges herself so that her ears are beneath the water and lies with her eyes closed, listening. Wearing a delicate summer dress, Emily walks in a sunny park and approaches a children's choir singing in the open to an audience of adults who clap along. Ezra is playing the piano, and Emily watches and looks moved. When the songs ended, Ezra points the audience's standing applause towards the choir and rises, bows, then gestures to the choir again. Emily watches intensely through wide, gentle eyes and cranes her neck to keep track of Ezra as he leaves the stage and moves effortlessly towards members of the audience. Emily walks over to Ezra as he chats to some of the children in passing. He turns to her confidently; he's no longer blind. Emily shakes her head, her eyes begin to fill with tears and glisten. Emily nods and blinks back tears as light dawns in Ezra's eyes. He smiles gently, and Emily smiles through her tears, which roll down her cheeks. Ezra gazes at her incredulously and shakes her hand, and another big tear rolls down Emily's cheek.",
    "1143": "A merman prepares to attack, but Cedric appears with a transparent bubble of air over his mouth and nose, using his wand to free Cho, which scares off the merman. Cedric taps his watch as Harry nods and draws his wand to release Hermione, but a sharp, pointed trident is held at his throat. Harry turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark, which has human legs and arms and wears red shorts, looms towards him. The shark flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with Hermione. Harry takes a firm grip on Ron's arm, then looks at the girl with long, fair hair floating alone. He looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds and uses his wand to release the little girl. As the time approaches eight minutes to 12, Cedric and Cho are the first to the surface and swim ashore. Meanwhile, Dumbledore and Crouch hurriedly descend the stairs of the pavilion. Hermione appears on the surface with the shark, which immediately transforms its head into Viktor Krum. Wrapped in a dressing gown, Fleur watches the water anxiously. As Harry struggles towards the surface with Ron and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed and is suddenly attacked from below by a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows with sharp teeth and many legs nipping at his ankles. He tries to kick them away and releases his grip on Ron and the little girl, pushing them up towards the surface. As he clutches his neck, hundreds of the creatures attack him, almost suffocating him with their tentacles. Struggling to fight them off, he pulls out his wand, and sparks fly, stunning the grindylows and sending them flying in all directions. Harry then sinks to the bottom. As the clock strikes twelve, Ron and the little girl bob to the surface, and Fleur leans out over the water, stretching out her hand. With his gills now gone, Harry drifts helplessly, looking up at the patch of light above his head, and with a last desperate effort, raises his wand and rockets out of the water onto the landing stage, gasping for air. Fleur kisses Harry and Ron and wraps a towel around him, while Dumbledore puts his wand to his throat and Karkaroff is furious. Harry is with Crouch as wild-haired Moody glares at Crouch with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue. Crouch stares back into Moody's scarred face, then walks away looking confused. Moody swigs from his hip flask. The scene shifts to the forest at night, where Harry sees a black hat lying on the ground and clutches the scar on his forehead. A man lies on his back among the fallen leaves, heaped-in and lifeless. Harry approaches Professor Dumbledore's room, finds the door closed, and Moody opens it.",
    "782": "Jane starts her day by going to the bathroom to moisturize her hands and then does some work on her laptop. Shuffling papers, she glances at the door before doing sit-ups and cleaning the cooker in rubber gloves. Jane struggles with her emotions, and the next day, the sisters arrive at Hell's hardware store. Jane lets the door close on Tess as her father stares disapprovingly at Jane's agonized expression. While Tess and George flirt in his office, Jane frowns upon seeing Kevin's name in her filofax, then decides to dial Kevin's number. Kevin grins and hangs up, while a youngster with a baseball glove enters, and Pedro frowns. They arrive at the Department of Parks and Recreation Youth Sports ground, where Pedro grins at them from the baseball field as Jane rolls her eyes in disbelief. A large bunch of yellow flowers is delivered, and Jane hands them to Tess with a tight smile. Later, she brings paperwork to George's office, grinning as he happily talks on the phone, but her smile fades at the sight of pictures of him and Tess. They all have dinner at Jane's father's house, where she unhappily stuffs her face with food as Tess chatters and the men smile. At her apartment, Jane finds Tess and George kissing on the couch and, feeling crushed, leaves them to it and goes out again. She attends a leather and bondage wedding, wearing a spiked leather collar, trying to be in a party mood. Jane flicks the heavy metal devil horns at George and Tess, who do the same as they grin. When they kiss, Jane looks mortified as Casey catches her eye. George holds up two ties for her approval, and he nods tight-lipped as she knots the tie. She smiles after him and heads back to her desk. In the evening at the office, Jane tidies away files on George's desk and finds his wallet underneath. After consulting his appointments, she sighs and leaves. A taxi pulls up outside a restaurant, and Jane gets out. Tess looks stunned, and Jane is at a loss. A small white box is tucked in the dog's collar, which contains a diamond ring. He slips the ring on her finger, and they kiss as Jane stands helplessly nearby. It's a wedding dress, and Jane later meets up with Kevin in a bar, where she looks pleased with herself. He takes her hand, and Jane stares in shock across the Central Park boating lake before they return to their yoga. There's a meeting at the New Warsaw bakery, where Kevin claps, and Jane, who looks tearful, pulls herself together. Kevin looks down a street past a shop and up the steps to Jane's building.",
    "833": "The real cat leaps from a sideboard. A photograph appears. He reorientates the phone screen and throws a food wrapper out of the car window. Harken jogs up in a mismatched designer track suit. Preoccupied with his iPhone, Dale doesn't see him. Harken picks up the wrapper and glowers. Dale spins around. Harken collapses. Dale plunges an EpiPen injection into Harken's chest. Kurt looks out of a bedroom window. They see Dale pounding Harken's chest. Kurt unwittingly drops Bobby's mobile as they hurry out. He drives the long needle into Harken's neck as Kurt and Nick leg it out of the house. A car pulls up. He comes to. She kisses Dale. Harken snatches the EpiPen. Nick and Kurt walk together. Dale screeches up in Kurt's Volkswagen. Traffic streams along a highway as night turns to day. The guys stride down a supermarket aisle like they mean business. Nick finds rat poison. He compares two brands, Rat Attack and Rat Out. He opts for the Rat Attack. Kurt tries out some binoculars. He hones in on a tight backside and smiles. Lowering the binoculars, he sees that the ass belongs to a guy holding a yucca plant. Kurt blanches and returns the binoculars to the shelf. Dale happens upon jars of peanuts. There's an offer on, three for one, $2.49. He fills his basket with jars. The guys leave. Dale is laden with three carryout bags of nuts. The guys get in their separate cars. Kurt reverses his white sedan, making way for Dale and Kurt who close in on the same narrow gap and stop. Kurt falters, then drives in front of Nick and circles the two cars to bring up the rear. As Nick drives off to the right, Dale goes to turn left, blocking Kurt who brakes jerkily. The sun sets beyond the city limits and day turns to night. The guys park outside the houses of their assigned bosses. Dale waits outside Harken's. Two Thai sex workers leave Bobby's. One was a man dressed as a woman. Bobby goes back indoors. Kurt spies Julia through binoculars. She goes to the boot of her car. As she bends over to retrieve a bag, Kurt ogles her backside. As sultry Julia heads indoors, Kurt's phone rings. Seeing a light come on in Harken's place, he shuts the player and pays attention. In a walk-in wardrobe, Harken sniffs one of his wife's dresses and roots through her handbag. He walks into the lounge. Harken's gray mackerel striped tabby cat is stretched out under a chair, purring up Bobby's phone. Harken grabs the phone and brings up a profile of its owner, complete with name, photograph and details. Dale ducks down in his car seat as Harken drives past in his SUV.",
    "1294": "Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine. Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the day's events sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her. Mark nods and sits down. There's a loud knock on the front door. Mark opens the door. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van. He holds it up. We can see there's writing on the back. Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it. A porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting. Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. She picks a crocus from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it. Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes. Juno enters. A wave of realization crosses Juno's face. Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly. Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain. The doctor reveals Juno's baby boy above the sheet. Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter and she passes out. Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on. The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer. Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. Bleeker looks out at the bleachers, scanning them for Juno. Bleek takes off running toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator. A nurse reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby. It looks like it was handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment. It's a sparkling summer afternoon. She waves goodbye to Bren, who is playing in the yard with two Weimaraners. She looks happy, but older. She looks almost as happy with her dogs as Vanessa looked with her baby. Juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage. She's obviously not pregnant anymore. Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag.",
    "847": "Sandy reaches into his pockets and comes up empty, then looks at Diana. He walks back to the bench, sighs, and shakes his head. Diana looks away somberly as Sandy gazes down at his pants. He sits beside her, kicks off the shoes, looks down, and pulls out a wad of cash. At the salvage yard, they pull out of the lot in an old, run-down Chevy Caprice. At the bus station, the skiptracer limps in and takes a sip from the juice pouch, tossing it on the ground as he walks over to the ticket booth. The attendant recoils from the skiptracer's bloody face. He looks around the empty station, then sees the attendant with the hand out, twisting his wrist, and writes down and hands the skiptracer a slip of paper as the skiptracer holds his gun up to the window. As he backs away, a bullet rips through his neck and shatters the glass. Paolo's thugs approach with silenced pistols. The skiptracer holds his neck wound as Julian takes the address. Maricol looks at the attendant and holds her finger up to her lips, and the booth window falls apart. Now, Sandy and Diana cruise down the highway toward a bridge. In the car, Sandy's hardened gaze fixes ahead as Diana sits on her side facing him. He swerves the car, smashing her head on the window, and swerves again. Later, they cruise over the Mississippi River into St. Louis, where the Gateway Arch stands tall over the city. At a gas station, Sandy fills up as Diana emerges from the car, and Sandy looks up thoughtfully. Diana falls in the lobby, and the security guard hurries over. As he rubs Diana's leg, a businessman enters the executive fitness center, and Sandy glances around, then slips inside the closing door. Sandy watches the man place his suit in a locker as the guard rubs Diana's butt. The businessman closes his locker with the code and leaves. Sandy quickly approaches, puts in a code, and opens the locker. He glances back with a smile. Now, in a dapper suit and red tie, he strolls through the offices with Diana. They spot a balding man behind a desk. Diana and Sandy exchange a look; she faces the man, shielding her mouth with her hand, as he lifts his phone and Diana backs away. He stares into Ken's eyes with his brow raised. On a security monitor, Sandy enters the code, and our view lowers inside the records room as a glass door and metal gate slide open. Sandy and Diana briskly enter, and pulling equipment from her bag, Diana hard-lines her credit card burner into the network as Sandy searches the shelves, finding Cornish's records in a box.",
    "351": "Sam runs into the tower to find Frodo struggling against his bonds as Gorbag climbs back into the room. Gorbag grabs Frodo's hair and pulls his head back, exposing his neck, and pulls out his sword, ready to cut Frodo's throat. Suddenly, Gorbag gasps as Sting is rammed into his back by Sam, and Gorbag falls dead. Frodo is humbled by Sam's unswerving loyalty, and Sam quickly cuts Frodo free. Sam pulls the ring from his pocket, and Frodo looks at Sam amazed as his eyes drop to the ring. Sam hesitates, and tension instantly builds between them as Sam seems strangely reluctant. On the soundtrack, the hum of the ring builds as Sam drops the ring into Frodo's palm, and Frodo sags in relief. He puts the ring back around his neck, looking at Sam with pain in his eyes, while Sam's plain hobbit face is full of compassion. Sam's resolve hardens, and a new strength takes hold. Frodo and Sam, now dressed in foul-looking Orc gear, turn east and walk over the summit of Cirith Ungol into Mordor. They stop dead, seeing Mount Doom 50 miles away, across the barren Gorgoroth Plateau, where the mountain is erupting streams of ash and lava high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of Mordor with a flickering orange wash. With immense trepidation, Frodo and Sam head down the steep path into the dark kingdom, as two tiny figures in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before them lies the Plain of Gorgoroth, and their eyes are drawn to the ominous silhouette of Mount Doom. Frodo's eyes travel down towards the hundreds of fires which glow on the plains beneath them, where thousands upon thousands of Orcs are encamped. Their eyes are drawn to a dark looming shape, and a red light seems to sweep across the plain—the Great Eye of Sauron! Sam cannot see what Frodo sees, and gently, he urges Frodo on. Meanwhile, Gandalf stands in the tower hall, turns, and crosses the hall to reveal the presence of Gimli, Legolas, Éomer, and Aragorn, who has his back to Gandalf. Gandalf remains troubled and worried. Gimli sits insolently on the seat of the steward, and Gandalf looks across at the dwarf, his face ashen. Aragorn turns around suddenly, and Gandalf looks up sharply at him. At this, Gimli chokes on his pipe, and Éomer steps forward. Aragorn, wearing a breastplate emblazoned with symbols, rides at the head of a column of 500 foot soldiers from Rohan and Gondor, leading them from the ruins of Osgiliath, while Gandalf, Legolas, Gimli, Éomer, Merry, and Pippin ride directly behind him. Great armies of Orc and Uruk-hai stream across the plains from Mordor, invading the volcanic wasteland of the Gorgoroth foothills. Frodo and Sam, still disguised in the Orc armour, slide down a scree bank and land on the road below.",
    "740": "Celia is brought a drink as Jolene runs up onto the stage, while Minnie and Aibileen exchange a look and Mrs. Walters smiles gaily. Celia shimmies up behind Hilly, and as Hilly tries to stop her, she rips her sleeve. Hilly's look of horror is followed by a patronizing smile, as Celia suddenly looks pale and weaves her way through the tables. Minnie slips away. Later, Hilly is at the bottom of the stairs, saying goodnight to her guests, and Hilly grimaces angrily as her mother parades her pie at shoulder height like a waitress, while Mrs. Walters and a male guest walk off. The next morning, Celia shakes her head despairingly, prompting Minnie to move towards her and, like a schoolteacher, points Celia to a seat at the base of the bed and closes the door of the bedroom. Celia shoots Minnie an appalled sidelong glance. At her house, Aibileen and Minnie are smiling at Skeeter's manuscript. Elsewhere, Skeeter drops her bag on the floor and walks into her mother's bedroom where Charlotte is sitting on her bed without a wig, sewing a sampler. Charlotte takes off her specs and stares at her. In flashback, Charlotte poses with her medal and winks at Constantine, who nods approvingly by the door. At the lunch following the medal ceremony, Constantine serves each lady in turn under Charlotte's rather anxious gaze. Charlotte glances towards the door and then at Constantine, who has not heard the knocking. Constantine sees her going to the door, and Charlotte glances over her shoulder, shuts the fly screen, and Rachel's face falls as she barges in. The guest of honor looks appalled as Charlotte weighs up her options and swallows hard. Rachel leads her mother away by the hand, both of them looking back at Charlotte in disbelief as they go through the door onto the porch. Constantine turns and looks back at Charlotte through the fly screen, and Charlotte's brown eyes meet her gaze for a second before looking at the unforgiving faces of the Daughters of America seated at her dining table. The frail, old servant won't be moved, keeping her uncomprehending gaze directed at Charlotte, who shuts the door in her face. Constantine, in a smart cream dress and navy hat, is packing her suitcase, tossing a cross to the door of her bedroom, and tracing her fingers along the lines on the door where she had marked Skeeter and Rachel's heights as they grew, finally arriving at the top. In the present, Skeeter sheds bitter tears, shakes her head in numb disbelief, and Charlotte, her own eyes welling, covers her mouth with her hand, seeing Skeeter's unhappiness. Finally, Skeeter drives the blue Cadillac slowly along a dirt road and peers through some trees at a single-story, white clapboard house, its roof overgrown, standing in a small clearing.",
    "639": "Morgan fetches a video, and Graham stares wide-eyed at the screen. Now seated, Morgan uses his inhaler beside Merrill, while Bo is at the other end of the sofa beside her dad. All four of them are hypnotized by the TV, on which sit two glasses of water. Later, in the dim light, Graham and Merrill remain transfixed, while the children sleep. Graham stares ahead and meets Merrill's gaze, who looks away as his smile fades, and Graham appears somber. Uneasy, Merrill ponders this before recalling something, causing his face to brighten a little, and he grins. Graham watches the TV while Merrill looks at him and then nods. Graham gives a knowing glance to his brother, who, looking forlorn, returns his gaze to the TV. Graham stares vacantly as his eyes meet Merrill's, who shakes his head. With conviction, Graham stares piercingly at Merrill, looking almost angry, his features taut and eyes glistening as he turns to face the TV. Merrill looks down thoughtfully, then turns to the TV as well, and they watch together with blank expressions, as if in a trance. Now, a fresh-faced Graham, dressed in black and wearing a white dog collar, drives slowly down a country road at night. Ahead, the lights of emergency vehicles flash, and Caroline stands in the road, waving her arms above her head. His face long, Graham pulls to a stop and climbs out as Caroline walks up to meet him. Graham wakes up on the sofa, scanning the room with glazed eyes as light floods through the windows into the comfortably furnished room. He heaves himself into a sitting position and remains still for a while before spotting a black cable snaking across the polished dark wood floor. Hoisting himself to his feet, he follows the cable across the room into the hallway, discovering it leads into a closet under the stairs. Graham opens the door to find a bleary-eyed Merrill sitting perfectly still, staring at the TV, and he looks up, a little surprised. Uncomfortable, Graham leaves, and the doors shut. Later, Graham, in a blue dressing gown, pads out of the bathroom drying his ear with a towel, frowning as he goes to a window and looks into the empty garden with its swings, climbing frame, and picnic bench. Hearing a voice, Graham raises his eyebrows, walks along the landing, and enters the children's room, where Morgan and Bo sit on a bed wearing pointy, cone-shaped hats made of silver foil. They look up as Morgan holds a book open and Bo points to her hat. Graham enters, sits down between his children on the bed, peers down at Morgan's book, and Morgan closes it.",
    "86": "They look towards the departed PREACHER as JOHN has taken charge. He speaks very quietly, but calmly and cheerfully, as to an invalid. He starts down the rustling coal-heap, helping PEARL down, and they achieve the cellar floor. Meanwhile, PREACHER looks under the bed, and o.s., PREACHER'S footsteps come down stairs; JOHN leads PEARL carefully past a rake, a hoe, and a shelf-prop, and they crouch down beside an apple barrel. PREACHER'S footsteps cross kitchen o.s. Both look sharp towards the cellar door o.s. The door opens; PREACHER'S head, carrying a candle in holder, illuminates a white-washed wall and stairs, and he clop-clops nearly to the bottom of the stairs. ICEY's voice cuts cheerfully across his descent as she appears at the head of the stairs, her voice crackling with authority. After a short pause, the children, covered with coal-dust, emerge into the light and climb the stairs, with JOHN's head hung in defeat. As they enter the kitchen, we PULL BACK. JOHN looks to PEARL and we PAN HER IN as PREACHER'S hand named LOVE moves through her locks. We PAN with PREACHER and ICEY as they move towards the door, and he watches ICEY leave, o.s., as she goes away along the path outside. PREACHER, his back to us, watches her a moment, then turns, wondering what to do next. We begin with a HEAD CLOSE-UP of BIRDIE as he rocks, and PULL BACK; he is rocking and drunk. A bottle stands beside the picture, and he turns and speaks to the picture. His hands grip the edge of the chest on either side of the picture, which we now see. BIRDIE picks up the bottle, his hand and the liquor tremble, and the bottle falls from his hand onto its side on the edge of the chest. The reverse angle of the opening shot shows BIRDIE rocking heavily as liquor gurgles from the bottle to the floor. PREACHER sits at the head of the table with JOHN standing to his right, around the corner of the table, expressionless and immobile until he speaks. The table is loaded with good food as PREACHER, well-fed and at leisure, dabs his mouth delicately with his napkin, folds it, puts it in a ring, and folds his hands, waiting. PEARL frowns and puts her finger in her mouth, remembering he twisted her arm. PREACHER slaps the table; his eyes crackle and PEARL starts to snivel. He brings out the knife, and PEARL shakes her head for no. He touches the spring; the blade flicks open, and he lays the open knife on the table. PEARL thinks the knife is a toy and crosses behind JOHN to pick it up, her mouth quivering as a large tear brims in her eyes. She sniffles and wipes her eyes with her free fist.",
    "816": "Alicia joins the group, cringing as she holds the flouncy purple dress, while Alette considers and then hands Alicia Rebecca's bag, leaving long-legged Alicia holding it. Alicia slams it down, slumps next to it, narrows her eyes, opens the bag, and picks up the mobile. Rebecca nervously emerges from the changing cabin wearing the purple dress, and Alette nods as Rebecca smiles at her reflection in the mirror and looks at the label of the dress. Alicia watches with a smug smile. In the bridal shop, Rebecca, in a pink maid of honor dress, is blindfolded, and the petticoat is blue and green. Suze spots a Barney's carrier bag. As Rebecca runs down the street with two store bags, a black car draws up and a tall, silver-haired woman in a beret gets out. Rebecca runs into the meeting where the silver-haired woman sits down, looks around at the group, and holds up Rebecca's shopping bag. The group arrives at a thrift shop where Ryuichi raises his hand, and a basketball player picks Rebecca up and shakes her. She runs back to the thrift shop, encountering a surly girl in a wheelchair. Graham switches on his TV as Jane elbows him with excitement, and the studio audience looks at him. Rebecca covers her face as Smeath’s jaw drops and Tarquin chokes on his cereal while Smeath waves the list of excuses at the studio audience. Rebecca gives Luke a helpless look, her eyes brimming with tears, and shuts her eyes, bowing her head at seeing Luke's disappointed face. Luke then strides out of the TV studio as Rebecca miserably wanders home in her purple dress and Yves Saint Laurent coat. Suze bursts out of the front door to meet her, and a bag lady with a shopping trolley passes by in a pink dress with a green and blue petticoat. Rebecca searches for an explanation, her face crumpling as Luke pauses, derailed by his own feelings. Graham and Jane’s mobile home pulls up outside Rebecca and Suze’s building, and Mr. West eyes Luke while Ryan smiles unpleasantly. Luke looks blown away as Rebecca, now a tiny dot, wanders along a wintry lake shore. Jane and Graham are by their mobile home; Jane brings out a book, and Graham joins Rebecca by the lake shore. Rebecca shoots him a look and, looking up at her dad’s jowly face filled with fierce love, she smiles. He puts an arm around her, and she lays her head on his big barrel chest as tears roll down Jane’s face as she watches her husband standing facing the lake with his arm around Rebecca. At home, Rebecca finds a note from Suze and glumly steps into the room, looking at all the clothes piled up on the bed.",
    "946": "Holmes looks into the corridor, steps into a compartment, and shoos the elderly couple out of their compartment. A soldier opens a crate, takes out a Maxim machine gun, fixes it onto its tripod, and loads the belt-fed ammunition into the breech. The weapon is cocked, and the soldier opens fire, with bullets ripping through the walls of the first class compartments, showering Watson and Holmes with debris. Watson closes the exterior door and sees Holmes lying down. Holmes pulls Watson down beside him, lights a pipe, and hands Watson a pistol. The lipstick Holmes put in the machine gun belt jams the gun. Watson shoots through the hole created by the machine gun bullets, hitting a soldier who drops a grenade. The soldier realizes he's inadvertently pulled the pin out of the grenade, which then drops back into a bag full of grenades. The grenades explode, blasting the train in two. The train rattles on through the night as Watson and Holmes sit in the ruined lavatory of their carriage, which is at the end of those still attached to the engine. A flashback to her falling from the train is followed by Mycroft appearing in a boat. Holmes, whose face is smeared with lipstick and eye shadow, waits awkwardly for the answer while Watson smiles ruefully at the mention of Paris. Black smoke belches from the funnels of a paddle-steamer as it leaves the white cliffs of Dover behind, with Watson and Holmes, now out of disguise, on the steamer's rear promenade deck. Watson takes Irene's monogrammed handkerchief out of Sims' bag, glances at Holmes, who takes the hanky, walks to the railing, sniffs it, and then looks out to sea. Watson watches Holmes closely as Holmes looks down at the hanky, glances over his shoulder at Watson, and casually tosses it over the side. The paddle-steamer approaches the French coast. A flier posted on a wall in Paris advertises a lecture by Professor Moriarty. Inside a grand building, Moriarty is signing a copy of his book on asteroids for an admirer, hands it back, and as another man approaches, a bearded agent sits beside Moriarty and passes him a note. Moriarty looks at the note, puts it in a leather covered notebook, signs another book, turns to his agent, and the agent takes two tickets from his jacket pocket before leaving. Outside, the agent wanders over to a rough looking bloke leaning against a wall.",
    "408": "Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages, with Ben a step or two behind her. Carl strides up to them, takes the pipe out of his mouth, and puts it in his pocket, reaching out to take Elaine's hands. Carl frowns and looks over Elaine's shoulder at Ben, who smiles and steps forward to grasp Carl's hand. Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder. The three of them look at each other for a moment. There is another KNOCK, and Elaine is standing in the hall. Ben nods, moves in behind her, and puts his hand on her arm as several boys gather in the hallway trying to see into the room. Ben edges through the door into the hallway, opens the door a little way, and they all try to see in. The boys start back to their rooms, leaving Mr. McCleery and Ben standing and looking at each other for a few seconds before Mr. McCleery turns away, walks down the hall, and starts down the stairs. Ben turns and goes back into the room where Elaine sits in a chair, watching him as he goes to the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer, and puts them in the suitcase before going back to the bureau. He gets down on his knees to look under the bureau, then returns to the bureau to get some socks and underwear, carrying them to the suitcase. He goes back to the bureau again, opens a drawer, takes out some T-shirts and the beer can, and carries them to the suitcase. Elaine gets up, goes to the door, and opens it, walking out and shutting the door behind her. Ben crosses to the window, and through the window, we see Elaine walking away, the length of the street until she disappears. Ben is asleep in his bed and suddenly sits up, standing in the darkness by the door. He gets out of bed, goes to her, and they kiss. She shakes her head, nods, goes to the door, opens it, and steps into the hall. He goes to the door as students move quickly from building to building. Ben is walking alongside Elaine as they move up the steps of a classroom building. Ben pushes through a lot of students to keep up with Elaine as they walk down a corridor with open doors on each side to classrooms with students filing into each of them. Elaine turns into one of the doors, leaving Ben in the hall as all the classroom doors close, and he leans against the wall.",
    "265": "Hi and Ed are raising their heads, facing forward, and do not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window as he saws out his second shotgun. Hi looks around, reaches, and pulls Ed down beneath him just as KA-BOOM! - the second shotgun roars and the back window spits in. As Lenny roars past the back window, he casually flips something in, and below them, something bounces into and around the leg well - Lenny's grenade. As the two front doors fly open, Hi and Ed spill out - Hi from the driver's side, heading for the far side of the road, and Ed from the passenger side as she dives for cover behind a parked car. Beyond her, KABOOM! - their car explodes and bounces, pouring black smoke, and the explosion flings Hi to the ground in the middle of the street. Looking up the street, Hi sees Lenny wheeling his bike in a U-turn; he is not finished yet. Hi lies flat on his back, woozily shaking his head, and he weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street, down the length of his own body, where his legs stretch away in a V. Crashing down from a wheelie, Lenny's roaring bike is almost upon him, aiming up the middle of the V, so Hi rolls as the bike roars by, reaches, and snags a chain on Lenny's passing boot. Dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off, Hi is left on his stomach in the middle of the road. Hi looks up the road as Lenny is again sluing the bike around, smoking as it skids around in the foreground, completing its turn; boom up Lenny's back to reveal Ed stomping straight up the street toward him - unarmed, unafraid. As Ed closes in, Lenny's arms rise into frame, and with a roll of his wrists, two knives appear in his hands. On his stomach, Hi sights down the gun toward Lenny as Ed steps into his line of fire, blocking Lenny, and raising an arm to stab. Ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat, revealing Hi behind her as he fires, and Lenny, drilled by Hi's bullet, drops its knife. The exit wound spurts, not flesh and blood, but a brief jet of fire, and quick as a flash, Lenny hurls the other knife at Hi. The knife stings the gun out of Hi's hand as Lenny bends to scoop up the knife he dropped. As Ed runs toward the bank, clutching Nathan Jr. to her chest and bursts in, the floor is littered with obedient hayseeds. From where Hi lies prone, BANG: the front door bursts open before Lenny's roaring hog, which sails off a step into the sunken atrium and lands with a CRASH amidst the hayseeds.",
    "303": "Lisa slowly helps Jeff to lobster from the main dish, and shooting over Jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan-bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. There is one light burning behind Lisa's head, and Jeff looks at her soberly. She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table, where we observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. The brightness drains from Lisa's face, and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table as a fierce discussion is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body, and legs, and Jeff raises both his hands. Lisa draws back one leg and points a finger challengingly, then stretches out on the divan while Jeff begins to get angry, eventually becoming definitely angry. She looks at him for a moment without speaking, and after a moment of silence, Jeff says earnestly, as if remembering some old experience. Shooting over Lisa's shoulder, and down her body, we see Jeff in the chair beyond. Lisa turns on her side, and stares into the room angrily, realizing she is getting nowhere. We see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture as Lisa, still looking out into the room and without turning, speaks. She turns at last and looks across at him, then starts to rise from the divan, the camera panning up as Jeff looks across at her with some concern. Lisa moves away from the camera into the center of the room, saying something as she begins to move around the room assembling her possessions preparatory to leaving. From Jeff's viewpoint, we see Lisa pause in the act of gathering her things together, get her stole, and Jeff's eyes follow her up the steps toward the door. Jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it and remains silent as Lisa turns in the half-opened door. Jeff tries to be pleasant and offhand, while Lisa stands in the open doorway, continues smiling, and then closes the door softly behind her. The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. A low camera captures Jeff's head in the foreground with Stella just behind him, working on his back. She attacks the sore muscle vigorously, stops massaging, reaches for the oil, and hits his back with a palmful of cold oil, which takes his breath away. She helps him to a sitting position, hands him his shirt which he proceeds to put on, and then helps him into the chair, the back of which is to the window.",
    "160": "Nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at Gandhi's eyeline, causing Gandhi to take his eyes from his writing and look, almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru. Gandhi's hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him and turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand with effort, eventually seeing Patel. Patel sits near the head of the cot, placing the three of them on a level. Outside the canopied area, Bourke-White is crouched, with her camera framing the three of them. Gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him, then shakes his head. However, Nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair, which Bourke-White captures, showing the sense of elation on his face. From her discreet distance, she lowers the camera, holding it against her mouth, waiting for Gandhi's response. Gandhi nods to Nehru, accepting the news with sad wistfulness, and glances at Patel, recognizing with him that their belief they could talk Gandhi out of the fast was deeply misplaced. Nehru turns back with no confidence, only concern, while Gandhi smiles, pain etched in his eyes, and touches Nehru's hand. Nehru stares at him, feeling sudden fear that Gandhi means it, and Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, Bourke-White share the same realization. An outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd, which has grown larger, including more women. The crowd spreads from Gandhi along the street, pressing against walls, staring and terrified to move. Among them are the frightened, apprehensive faces of Godse, with Apte and Karkare nearby. Nehru stands, staring at them all, his face seething with anger. On the cover is an image of rioting men fighting diagonally across a cut-out of Gandhi on his cot. Mirabehn rises, leaving the magazine at her feet, and moves to Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad ushers them into the canopied area, while Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits quietly in the background. Mirabehn speaks softly, and Nehru looks across at Gandhi. The doctor, testing Gandhi's pulse again, glances back at the two—offering no encouragement—and moves away. Nehru moves to the side of the cot, where Gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand, but he is in pain. Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy, who nods, then back at Nehru, smiling whimsically and touching him again, though there is no change in his attitude. Nehru looks at him hopelessly as a huge crowd and some smoke from distant buildings are visible, indicating they are still in Calcutta, and all is not yet at peace.",
    "896": "Five cars follow the motorcyclists along a dim street, and in Dillinger's car, the criminal stares off glumly before smiling out the window. Dozens of civilians line the street, cheering, and the gang leader raises his shackled hands to wave. A young man rushes toward the window as Dillinger's eyes gleam while other fans wave excitedly, and he gives a coy, half-smile. Later, the convoy drives onto a bridge, passing a set of raised barricades. In the courthouse, a deputy shoves through a crowd of journalists toward a counter, where a plainly dressed woman paces in an office. She strides out to the crowd, and as arriving lawmen lead Dillinger inside, cameras flash and the robber skeptically furrows his brow. An officer unlocks Dillinger's wrist restraints, and a chubby lawyer puts an arm around Dillinger, who rests his elbow on the man's shoulder. The female sheriff glowers as Dillinger shrugs his brows and swaggers off, escorted by deputies. Later, a guard unlocks a cellblock door and a deputy guides a portly lawyer inside. The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead. A hulking black inmate strides past a row of cells into a common room where Dillinger reads a newspaper. The hulking man leans to Dillinger's ear, and Dillinger scowls toward his cell, then heads over as the hulking inmate positions himself just outside and waves to two prisoners. Dillinger faces the bars at the back of his cell, with the lawyer, Piquett, sitting in a corridor on the other side. Piquett sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air. In a courtroom, Piquett sits at a counsel bench as a deputy escorts Dillinger in shackles. Piquett faces the deputy while the judge folds his hands thoughtfully, and Bob turns away with a humorless look. As the crowd rises, Dillinger winks at Piquett, who steps away, and as the deputy approaches, Dillinger lowers his gaze. Later, outside the jail, a cluster of National Guardsmen stands watch by a waist-high wall of sandbags, while inside, prisoners mill about the common room. As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor enters. Later, he hangs up his coat, and a guard unlocks a barred door, raising his baton to a second metal door just inside. The guard looks through a peephole and unlocks the door for the janitor, who carries a mop and bucket, crosses a hallway, and waits for another guard to open another barred door. In the common room, Dillinger tilts his head and clenches his jaw as the janitor enters and the guard shuts the door behind him. Dillinger coolly glances over his shoulder, the janitor sets down his supplies and heads over, and Dillinger grabs Cahoon by the back of his jacket, pointing an odd, waxy gun at his head.",
    "1313": "Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. David's eyes dart up as the slick-haired man turns the corner at the information booth, and he watches him for a beat. David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip as he walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. David turns his hands back in and seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself, then steps back to look around. He bumps the shoulder of a man standing behind him, taking a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. The enormous glassy-eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle and turns it as the man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him. The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening, but it opens slowly anyway. David stands frozen in the train station, his face almost unreadable, standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped, and they are shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man, who is huge, at least three inches taller than David, with massive shoulders and wearing a one-piece orange uniform. The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it, replaces it with a fresh one, throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels, and starts pushing it. Four identical gray bins sit outside the door, and the huge man disappears with his bin inside. David waits, staring hard at the double doors, and then they open as the huge glassy-eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder, now wearing a baseball hat with his uniform. He heads toward a back exit, and David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block, almost all the lights in the middle-class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest standalone homes, walking slower, and looks around carefully as he moves. He turns into a driveway of one of the homes, stops, and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face, standing in the shadows and watching silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.",
    "505": "In perfect lip sync is. There is a TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock, and TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, and others all looking intently at the screen, which displays a VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering a cashier to fill her purse with money. As the cashier loads the purse with bills, Thelma takes beef jerky from the display and adds it to the purse while pointing a gun at the cashier. Thelma and Louise are in the car driving, and Louise notices the speedometer touching 80 mph, so she lets her foot off the gas, looking a little nervous. Thelma howls like a dog and drinks from a little bottle of Wild Turkey. As they drive next to a truck, the truck driver smiles and waves at them, and they smile and wave back. He then flicks his tongue at them, causing Louise to scream. They both pause for a moment, and as the sun sets, the T-Bird drives deeper into the vast desert. Darryl sits in the hallway as two officers lead J.D. down the hall with Hal, Max, and other plainclothes officers following. Hal thinks for a moment, looks to Max, who agrees and opens the door for the others to leave. Hal and Max make eye contact before Max closes the door, and Hal sits down across the table from J.D. They sit there for a moment, then J.D. shifts in his chair. Hal opens the door, allowing Max and the others to straggle back in, and the TV is ON with the place in a mess. As the phone RINGS, Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action, donning headsets, turning on tape recorders. Darryl picks up the phone while Hal, Max, and others gesticulate wildly. Thelma hangs up the phone, leaving everyone disappointed as they take off their headsets and turn off tape recorders, looking at Darryl like he's an idiot. Darryl holds the phone in his hand as Thelma and Louise stare at each other intently. Louise steps up to the phone and again everyone springs into action while Darryl fumbles with the phone, giving Hal and Max a look as if he's got everything under control. Louise hangs up the phone and all are busy trying to trace the call. Darryl returns to his recliner, still in shock. Louise stomps back to the car with Thelma following doggedly. A moving van pulls in and parks in the background. Louise stops as she is about to get in, faces Thelma, who is standing on the other side of the car, yanks open her car door, gets in, slams the door, and fires up the ENGINE.",
    "721": "Jack leads Rose and his friends down another corridor and up a stairway to another locked gate, where at the top, a steward addresses a small crowd from behind it. Jack grabs the gate and shakes it, then rushes over and pulls on a wooden bench nailed to the floor, with Fabrizio and Tommy helping Jack pull up the bench. They charge forward and ram the gate, do so again, and Jack, Rose, and other passengers pass the steward, with Tommy punching the steward. On the boat deck, passengers swarm around the remaining lifeboats as Lightoller pushes away a group of men, and a man knocks a woman off the deck, grabbing onto the side of the lifeboat and dangling high above, while a sailor pulls the woman on deck. Lightoller lifts a revolver, waves the gun at the group of men, and turns toward a young sailor, while loading his revolver as Lowe boards the lifeboat. On the other side of the ship, Cal and Lovejoy peer down as Murdoch supervises the lowering of a lifeboat, and below, one lifeboat is lowered onto another sitting in the water but unable to detach, while in the lower lifeboat, a man labors to cut the ropes connecting the two boats. On the other side of the ship, Lowe stands in a lifeboat as it is lowered, waving his revolver at men on the decks as they try to jump into the boat, and Cal and Lovejoy turn as Lowe fires his gun in the air, with Cal following Murdoch toward the bow. Meanwhile, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy arrive on the upper deck, running to the side of the ship, where Jack stands up on the railing and gazes toward the bow, and as he steps down, Rose stops the mustached Colonel Gracie. Jack, Rose, and the others run toward the bow, while as the band plays on deck, a passenger bumps into one of the violinists, causing Hartley's brow to furrow. As the band resumes playing, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy run past, elsewhere, Murdoch and several seamen load a small boat, with Murdoch glancing around, then turning to a sailor. Cal slips money into Murdoch's pocket, and Murdoch glances down at the cash, exchanges looks with Cal, and walks off. On the port side, Lightoller loads passengers into a boat and shoots into the sky; in the crowd, Jack turns to Tommy, who moves off through the crowd. Meanwhile, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands beside the small boat called a collapsible, and Cal glances away as Murdoch turns to Cal and Lovejoy while Ismay helps load the collapsible. Cal stares at the collapsible, then blinks, turns, and walks off.",
    "511": "As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face, and locks lips with him, big time. He drops his keys and embraces her. There they stand, by the side of the road, drenched, kissing. Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other. He picks up the mail on the floor and jams them into the lock, opening the door. He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms. The place looks a mess - like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous activity. Then he freezes. He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco, which hits the floor with a pop. They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus. Banky blinks, then shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out. Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance; Holden saunters up and sits beside him. He follows Banky's gaze, and Banky shoots him a glare before walking away. Holden shakes his head. At an all-girl gathering, Tory, Nica, Dalia, and Jane help Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'. Tory letters a page, while Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork, and Dalia drinks wine. Alyssa buries her face, giggling, and they all cackle. Alyssa tries to laugh with them, but Dalia stares at her suspiciously. All four girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified. Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them. She smokes, and Holden looks down at a book, shakes his head at Banky, and flips it open to a page showing Alyssa's senior year photo. Cut to Cohee Lundon in the parking lot of Food City, addressing the camera. Back in the office, Holden stares at Banky, grabs him, and pins him against the wall, then releases him. Banky brushes himself off. Holden and Hooper peruse laser discs when a young black kid approaches Hooper, holding a comic book, and after the kid leaves, Hooper slips back into his real voice. On the ice, players skid into the corner, and the crowd around Alyssa and Holden goes wild. Player One checks Player Two into the boards hard; Alyssa is into the game. Player Two scrambles to his feet, throws down his gloves, pulls Player One's helmet off, and punches him in the face before yanking at Player One's jersey and gut punching him. Holden's face looks really sour. On the ice, Player One staggers a bit, quickly rights his jersey, and lunges at Player Two, landing a barrage of his own punches.",
    "1126": "The tiny tent is spacious inside. Harry sits beside a table piled with camping equipment. Hermione crouches by a bunk bed, listening to the radio. Harry leans back in his chair, deep in thought. Her knees drawn up to her chest, Hermione stares blankly at Ron's radio. He crosses over to her. He holds out a hand. Her face solemn, she takes both his hands and pulls herself up. Harry puts his arms around her neck. He unfastens the locket. He throws it onto the lower bunk. His eyes fixed on hers, he draws her away from the radio. She looks pale and wistful. Still holding her hands, Harry starts to move to the music. They twist back and forth and she half-smiles. Hermione grins and they start to move a little more imagistically. He spins around. They both smile and spin. His puts arm around her, they dance more closely. They hold their hands again. Laughing, they start to jive. Hermione spins into his arms. Harry leans his head against her. She rests her chin on his shoulder. They turn slowly, holding each other close. Hermione's smile fades. They stop dancing. They meet each other's gaze. Hermione sighs and walks away. Harry watches her go. Hermione sits reading on the flat-topped rocks. Inside the tent, Harry lies on a bunk, his arms folded, idly watching the snitch hovering above his head. He reaches out his hand. The fluttering wings slow then fold away. Harry draws the snitch down and holds it against his mouth. He looks at it. Writing appears on the golden surface: I open at the close. He hands it to her. She puts down her book and studies the writing. Harry sits beside her. A triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She frowns at the drawing. She ruffles his hair and smiles at him. Harry nods and grins after her, as she walks away. A few snowflakes drift past. They apparate in a quaint, snow-covered village. Wearing winter clothes, they wander down a deserted street. She takes his arm. Two villagers come out of an inn behind them. A little gate leads into the churchyard. She turns to him. In the graveyard, surrounding the church, Harry and Hermione study the name on the graves. The snow gently falls. Hermione stops at a grave marked with a horizontal slab. She brushes snow from it with her gloved hand. Carved on the slab is a triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She wipes away more snow and finds a name engraved underneath. He is standing at the far side of the graveyard. He looks down at a plain, upright gravestone.",

Walt stares into the distance with a frown and looks down at some hospital admission forms and test results. During the day, Thao carries a bundle of garden waste out to the front of his house while Walt watches from his porch as Spider's car comes slowly down the street. Thao sees it and goes back into the garden. Walt lights a cigarette as the modified Honda cruises slowly by. Smokie stares out of the car, and Walt mimes shooting him, to which Smokie responds by giving him the finger. Thao watches the exchange of gestures. Later, Walt opens his front door to Thao, and Walt is working under the sink in Thao's kitchen as the ceiling fan gyrates unsteadily. In his garage, Walt works on the fan with Thao, who folds his arms. Walt doubles up, and Thao sees he's coughed up blood. Thao nods at the Gran Torino, and Walt follows his gaze to the green V8 muscle car. Thao nods, and Walt grins. Down in his basement, Walt is busy moving an old freezer on a sack truck, attempts to get it up the stairs, but finds it hard going, and tugs away, then gives it up as a bad job. Thao opens his door to Walt, and they go down to Walt's basement, where they heave the freezer up the steps and get it outside. Thao rubs his neck. Sue finds Walt on his back porch as Thao washes the Gran Torino on the drive. She shrugs, then glances at Thao and goes to get one. Walt looks over at Thao. Later, he watches Thao working in the garden, gets a cigarette, and a lighter. Thao and Walt get out of his pickup truck and go in the barber shop. Thao goes out and comes straight back in. A gun. Martin takes a seat, and Thao comes back in. Walt and Thao drive up to a building site in Walt's old white Ford pickup, park up, and wear work gloves. They leave Tim's portacabin, and Tim sits back down at his desk. Walt's pickup truck pulls up outside C.M. Young Hardware and Lumber Store. Walt and Thao get out, go inside, and look around. Walt makes his way over to a shelf with what he's looking for, a tape measure, and a tool bag. Walt holds his hand out, and Thao shakes it. As they head off, Walt winces slightly, and carrying his new stuff, Thao gets off a bus and jogs down a back alley heading home. As he trots along, he sees Spider's Honda coming the other way. The car pulls up, and Spider and his four cronies get out, with Smokie stubbing a cigarette out on Thao's cheek.",
    "1264": "With one hand, Harry stems the flow of blood from Snape's neck and holds the phial to Snape's cheek, catching his tears in it. Harry removes the phial from Snape's cheek, grips it, as Snape studies Harry's face. Harry's lips tremble, Snape's eyes glaze over, and his head lolls to one side. Hermione briefly glances at Ron, then looks down at the floor. Harry stares at the dead Snape as the surface of the water starts to ripple and the building trembles. Harry steadies himself against the glass wall, while Ron holds onto the door and Hermione clasps her hands to her ears. Fred Weasley is injured as Hermione and Ron, distressed, stand a little way behind Harry. It's still dark, and pockets of fire burn throughout the school and grounds as the three friends make their way back up the path to the courtyard. Ron pushes open the doors of the Great Hall, and the three are confronted by piles of rubble. Further in, they see students and staff; two students carry someone out on a stretcher. Ron spots something and hurries forward with Hermione following, while Harry stands frozen in the doorway. Slughorn is tending to the wounded Filch and turns. Harry passes a long line of people being treated, witnessing Professor Trelawney and Padma Patil pull a blanket over a dead body. He sees the Weasleys up ahead, with George weeping, clinging to his father, and desperately hugging Ron. Fleur comforts Bill, and Molly, distraught, kneels beside Fred's body, stroking his hair. Ron joins Her, sobbing helplessly while Hermione stands at a distance. Harry watches the grieving family and glances to his left, seeing the bodies of Nymphadora and Remus lying side by side on stretchers, Remus' little finger resting on hers. Professor McGonagall limps towards Harry, who, without seeing her, turns and strides out of the Great Hall. He enters Dumbledore's old, undamaged office; as he steps further in, covered doors to his right open of their own accord and a stone pedestal slides out. Harry crosses to the pedestal, lifts out a shallow silver basin, and gently spins it through the air. It floats towards the desk at the far side of the room, and he follows the spinning Pensieve to the desk where it lands lightly. Holding the phial containing Snape's tears, Harry removes the stopper and empties the contents into the basin, causing misty black swirls to appear in the Pensieve. Harry sinks his face into the bowl, and the swirling black clears to reveal a meadow with two young girls, Lily and her sister Petunia, facing each other. Lily opens her palm to reveal a daisy growing in it, and an equally young Severus Snape emerges from a large tree trunk as Petunia runs off.",
    "670": "Set against a moody blue sky with towering white and gold clouds, a woman in Grecian-style robes holds aloft a shining torch as pages of comic magazines appear, followed by a spider's web behind letters that break up and vanish from the screen. Images of the principal actors are displayed, showing Peter Parker and his new muscular body, then as the prototype Spider-Man and the wrestling green cage. Peter fails to stop a thief and is seen kneeling by his dying uncle, leading to the beginnings of the Spider-Man costume, followed by more titles. Spider-Man stands over Norman Osborn as Harry walks into the room, and Peter Parker is at his Uncle Ben's graveside. Peter walks away from MJ in the graveyard, later gazing at a poster of MJ, the face of the parfumerie Emma Rose, while working as a pizza boy. Peter gazes blankly amid traffic at a standstill and, on his moped, weaves his way through cars and yellow cabs as a taxi pulls out in front of him. Stacked on the back of his moped are pizzas. A taxi stops in front of him, and he swings around it, seeing the lights change as a bus passes in front. He looks up at the clock, and another minute ticks by. Now on foot, Peter runs into an alley, ripping off his crash helmet as a guy watches the alley entrance. Out swings Spider-Man with the pizza, soaring through the skyscrapers high above land. He spots two kids running onto the street with a huge truck coming their way, tosses the pizzas, and swings down to pluck the kids away from the truck, setting them gently on the ground. A man steps onto a balcony and turns to see the pizzas on the balustrade, teasing out a slice as Spider-Man swishes past, grabbing the pizzas. Spider-Man then lands on a nearby building. The man goes to eat the pizza slice, but it’s whipped from his hand by a web. Inside the building Spider-Man landed on, a receptionist sits at a desk in a hallway with black-and-white checkered flooring and looks around upon hearing a noise, seeing a cupboard door opening. From it emerges Peter, carrying the pizzas, as brooms fall out behind him. Chewing her gum intently, the receptionist watches as he struggles to push the mops and brushes back inside, and with one final thrust, Peter pushes back the brooms and slams the door. He picks up the pizza boxes and notices something stuck to the top—it's some spider's web. The receptionist eyes him curiously as he pulls the stretchy, silky substance off and stuffs it in the back pocket of his jeans. He then strides up to the desk and lays the pizzas on it.",
    "503": "Louise slams the closet door, causing Thelma to jump. They are silent for a moment with Thelma staring down the road. She puts her finger down on the receiver as Louise hangs up the phone and walks away towards the front of the store. Thelma comes out of the front of the store, and Thelma and Louise look at each other while this sinks in. Thelma walks around to the side of the building to the phone as Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo. Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game. Thelma is trying not to cry and she's trying to be strong. Neither one of them say anything for a moment, and she hangs up on him. Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car. She makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see, and both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision. She notices how blue his eyes are and now she wants him to come. He starts to walk away from the car. Just then Louise comes out of the store and sees Thelma talking to this guy, and for one moment stops dead in her tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car. Although her face is basically expressionless, it’s possible she might kill Thelma. The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road. The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated that Louise wouldn't give him a ride but decides not to confront her. Louise lowers the top and backs the car out. They watch him walk away as Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road. They pass the Hitchhiker, who smiles and waves, and they drive down the road. There is a tight shot of the Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face. Thelma looks sulky while Hal goes over a list of every registered green T-Bird in the state, with names scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen and the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scrolls past. They are clear of the town, and Thelma is like a dog with a bone, just won't let it drop, while Louise looks very shaken up. She keeps her eyes on the road but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles are white. Suddenly, she reaches over and locks her door. There is an extreme closeup of Darryl's face and J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance. Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car coming down the road towards them, and she glides along as the cop car passes on the other side without seeing them.",
    "1147": "Red light streams from Harry's wand, and green light from Voldemort's, as the power from their wands collides and meets like molten lava in a burst of bright flame. Sparks fly as they struggle desperately to overcome each other while Harry controls his quivering wand with both hands and Voldemort's face is twisted with hatred. Streaks of light burst all around, illuminating the dark sky, and the ghostly images of Voldemort's victims appear, first Cedric, then Bryce, the old caretaker killed in the mansion. Harry's father and mother appear at his side, and his father speaks. Breaking the connection, Harry grabs Cedric as the cup flies into his hand, and Voldemort howls with frustration. Harry lands with Cedric in the arena, and the spectators go wild. Fleur senses that something is wrong, Dumbledore gets up and tries to pull Harry away, but Harry clings to Cedric's body as Mr. Diggory bursts through the spectators and weeps over Cedric's body. Moody pulls Harry up and helps him away as the students stand, stunned into silence. Still in a state of shock, Harry walks into Professor Moody's room, and Moody slides shut the iron lock on the heavy wooden door. Harry stands in a trance, pale and shaking, clutching his arm as his clothes are torn and his face is bloody. Moody pulls up a stool and sits him down in front of the fire, revealing Harry's deep gash, and grips Harry's arm. Moody's face twists with agony as he opens his hip flask but finds it empty, then runs into the next room and searches feverishly among bottles in a wooden box, but they are all empty. Moody stands in the doorway behind him, searches the shelves, and glares at Harry with his mad eye before grabbing Harry's arm and sucking Harry's blood from his fingers. The door bursts open, and Moody is flung hard against the stone wall as Dumbledore grabs him, and Snape pours truth serum into Moody's mouth. Moody looks towards the locked trunk, Snape points his wand, and the lid flies open. Then six more trunks open, one inside the other, and Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall peer into the trunk, down a deep shaft, where a figure with one leg and one eye lies far below. Snape sniffs the flask, and they turn and watch his face and body start to twist with violent convulsions as he wrenches off the leather patch with the mad, rolling eye and flings it down, transforming into a younger man who lashes out angrily. It's Mr. Crouch's son who lunges at Harry as Barty reveals the dark mark. Dumbledore uncovers Harry's wound, and Snape presses his wand hard against Barty's cheek as Barty narrows his eyes and flickers out his tongue. The entire school is assembled in the great hall, and Dumbledore finds Harry packing his case in the boys' bedroom.",
    "743": "Mrs. Walters watches TV as she has her lunch, and Skeeter arrives and joins the young women, hugging Elizabeth and then Hilly, who bites her lip. The bridge is now in full swing, with Skeeter playing with Hilly, Elizabeth, and Jolene. Hilly kicks Jolene with her stilettoed foot and smiles blithely. Skeeter goes on and lowers her eyes awkwardly. In the kitchen, Aibileen answers the phone, while platinum blonde Celia, in a yellow playsuit, rings off as her husband creeps up behind her, nuzzles her neck, and bends her backward by the edge of their swimming pool. Mrs. Walters has dropped off in front of the TV, and as Aibileen goes to take her plate, she takes another mouthful. Skeeter smiles at Aibileen, who is replenishing the ladies' glasses, while Elizabeth notices Hilly squirming. Aibileen listens passively, and Skeeter watches her, knowing Aibileen has heard every word, then looks down at her lap. Later, Hilly and her friends are standing by their cars, and Skeeter is inside, watching them through a window. She wanders across to Aibileen, who is clearing up, and Aibileen looks across with the same passive expression as before. Skeeter's attention is drawn to the voice on the TV as she hands Skeeter a piece of paper, and Elizabeth gives her a thin, cool smile. Skeeter pulls up outside a columned portico two-story house, and with her jacket over her arm and her briefcase in the other, she walks past a black servant trimming a box hedge at the front entrance, hurrying into the hall and up a wide, wooden staircase. She finds her mother, Charlotte, sitting at her dressing table in an evening dress and an elfin brown wig. Charlotte, with a cigarette in one hand, scoots off to the bathroom, pulling off the wig next to several wigs on stands, and grimly eyes her own limp and thin hair in the mirror. Skeeter slumps down on a sofa, looking annoyed, as Charlotte comes out in a brown bob, waiting for Skeeter's approval, and steps out of the green dress, while Skeeter scowls at her reflection. Her mother zips her up roughly, then sits Skeeter down. At dinner, Charlotte pats Carlton's hand, Robert Phelan takes a sip of bourbon, and across the table, Charlotte looks awkward, while Carlton, wearing a stiff smile, glances from one parent to the other. Skeeter fixes her eyes on her mother, who is concentrating on her soup, and as Skeeter storms away from the table, Phelan frowns lamely. His tall, angular wife pats him on the shoulder and leaves the room. Skeeter, striding down a pathway, stops, the sun outlining her long, ringleted hair as she gazes mournfully at a stone bench under a weeping willow tree, and in her mind's eye, she sees herself as a young, teenage girl sitting morosely on the bench.",
    "517": "She runs into the building; the taxi drives away. Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to Hannah. Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen. She wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in. Norma reacts, turning to her daughter. Hannah, however, has her back turned. She is busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks. She takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water. The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den. Evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top. He picks one up as Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen. The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks. She is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood moments before. She holds the water glass and the pills. Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano. Hannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away. Hannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup. Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen. The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect; it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up; Hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter. She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder. Mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen. Norma chuckles. They stop at the entrance to the den. Evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation. Norma chortles. Hannah laughs, touching her mother. They walk over to Evan at the piano. Norma leans over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection. The piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows her hair; she hugs the Edward Estlin Cummings book to her chest.",
    "647": "Maman kneels at the entrance and strokes Salim's foot, waking him up and handing him a Coke. Jamal also wakes and is given a Coke, and Maman pats him on the back, smiling. The boys grin and gulp down their drinks. A minibus drives through lush countryside, full of scruffy street kids gazing out the windows. The bus arrives at a large, dilapidated residence where numerous children play in the yard, some on crutches and others on swings. Salim smiles, and the children on the bus jump around excitedly. Maman watches as the children are fed a hot meal, while Jamal catches Maman staring at the new arrivals. In the evening, Maman lines up the new children and closes his eyes, listening to Arvind sing before patting him on the head. Arvind moves back in line, and Salim steps out to sing, but Maman screws up his face and buries his head in his hands. He strikes Latika and punches Punnoose's thighs as everyone laughs. The next day, Salim sits with Punnoose in the bus, intently watching a group of kids on a Mumbai street, then approaches the gang of children, claps his hands, and slaps a giggling child before snatching a baby from her and pretending to drop it in front of Latika. The gang of children run into the busy street, some limping with crutches and others with missing hands, shaking containers at people to beg for money or food. Latika, wearing an eye patch, begs at a stationary car window. At midnight in Maman's compound, Jamal points at some dried chillies, and Latika, wearing rubber gloves, picks up and crushes them in her palms. She sneaks into the dormitory, where all the children are sleeping, finds Salim sleeping naked under a thin sheet, and carefully stuffs the chillies over his groin before sneaking back to her side of the dormitory. Salim jerks awake and dashes to the tap, dousing his groin in cold water, while Punnoose wakes up and points at Latika. Jamal and Latika giggle and smile at each other. A bearded henchman lights a candle as Arvind sings for Maman, who holds up his hand. Punnoose shakes a bottle into a cloth and quickly smothers Arvind's face with it. Salim looks on, eyes wide and mouth agape, as Arvind collapses and Punnoose lifts his limp body to a table. Salim obeys, while the bearded man burns a sizzling liquid in a spoon over the flame.",

Debbie opens the door, dressed in a slinky outfit, and, leaving, she carelessly slides the door shut, but it bounces back open, prompting Pete to flip her off. The scene shifts to a club, where later, they face several men. He removes a partial, which Desi puts in her mouth, then drapes her arms around Debbie, who laughs as the younger woman pulls her clothes. Desi returns the partial to a man with a shaved head, who snaps them in and smiles. At the Belasco, the crowd springs to its feet as aging rockers take the stage, with many seats unoccupied toward the back and the balcony. At the bar, Pete wears a furrowed brow, while Ronnie gives them a cowed wave. At a dance club, Desi and the hockey players surround Debbie as she pumps her fists, and later, the two women writhe sideways across the floor like MC Hammer. Desi sways between two hockey players, and later, Debbie snakes side-to-side behind the younger woman, twirling her long, sweaty hair. A tall, boyishly handsome hockey player with a blonde beard dances with the two women, then does air claws with Debbie, and later, he sits with her, his mouth hanging open before he smiles. At the Belasco, the band sits at a table while roadies clear the stage, and the two rockers leave, patting each other's backs. In his car, Pete sits with his eyes glistening and his mouth twisting in a sob. He hangs his head, squeezes his eyes shut, then lifts his head back, his chin quivering, and his gaze calms as he swallows hard, but he bursts into tears all over again. Meanwhile, Debbie's car pulls up at an upscale apartment building, where a doorman stands out front, and Debbie stares at her awkwardly while nodding, and Desi gives a proud smile. Later, Pete lies on the bed using his tablet as Debbie enters, her smile fading as she stands before him with her sweater open and a nipple exposed. Pete glances between his tablet and Debbie several times, eyes her up and down, and then closes the tablet case. Debbie covers herself and walks away, while Pete remains in bed, fully clothed with sneakers on, and then grabs the tablet. Debbie reenters, fully clothed, glaring at Pete as he sits. She raises a brow and nods. In her room, Charlotte plays her keyboard as Debbie slowly shakes her head. Pete's mouth hangs open as he glares at his wife, and Debbie nods with a disheartened gaze, putting her hands on her hips and looking at the floor. Pete stares forward as she walks away, and Debbie raises her arms, then leaves the room. Lying between her parents, Charlotte sucks her fingers.",
    "708": "The marketing guy slaps various slogans onto a whiteboard then smiles cockily at the grouchy newspaper editor. Jameson calms down and speaks into an intercom. Jameson looks through the window at his assistant and points to one of a dozen pill bottles. She nods. He opens it. He forces a calm face and presses the intercom. He smiles graciously at the marketing guy. Brock slips into Jameson's office. Puffing on a cigar, Jameson waves Betty away dismissively. In Times Square, a billboard displays the letters NY followed by a heart and a picture of Spider-Man. A silver-headed man comes up alongside him. Peter ponders. With a friendly smile, the man goes. Later, Harry's doddery old manservant, Bernard, embraces his young master. Peter hands Harry an old basketball. Peter steals the ball off Harry and bounces it back to him in the lavishly-furnished hallway. Grabbing the ball from Harry, Peter turns into Norman's study and stares at the chaise longue and remembers laying Norman's dead body on it. Harry looks at his father's portrait. Peter tosses the ball to Harry and knocks a vase over. Harry nimbly catches the vase in one hand and the ball in the other. Peter looks concerned. Mary Jane strides into the theater where she's working. She comes through to the auditorium and her step falters. Another actress is going through her moves on stage. The actress spots Mary Jane at the back of the auditorium. Sitting in a sea of empty seats, the producer and director follow the actress's awkward gaze. The director puts on a fake smile. The producer looks unconvinced by his own suggestion. Mary Jane's blue eyes well up and she turns and walks away. The artistic duo return to their seats. Outside the theater, a crowd has gathered. Mary Jane's glum expression melts away. She smiles as they applaud. Her smile quickly fades as she realizes the crowd is not for her. She looks up at Spider-Man swinging by with barely-failed resentment. She hurries through the crowd as her name is covered up on the theater front with the name of Andrea Rubin. Peter is standing amidst the delirious crowd, smiling to himself, drinking in the adulation. A marching band cuts through, with workers waving placards and balloons. Brock approaches Gwen in the throng. Peter snaps Mary Jane. She forces a cheery smile as he walks off. The smile drops as she watches him disappear into the crowd. Elsewhere, stoney-faced Flint is lumbering along the street. He tilts his head. Some grains of sand seep out of his ear. He brushes them off his shoulder as he passes through cops. The cops race to the front and back of a large tarpaulin-covered lorry.",
    "564": "Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp. Kay looks up, sharply. Above him, Tony, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand. Laurel is at the end of her rope. Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out. He starts to reach for his gun. Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table explodes into the air, revealing Edgar, who was hiding beneath it. Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him. And with that he turns, leaps -- and crashes right through the window, into the air shaft. Edgar, still clutching Laurel, explodes up over a railing. Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway. And Jay starts running down the street, where dozens of cabs are waiting at the intersection. He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people. Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above. Just then, a loud alarm wails. At the main viewing screen, a green line shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking a region of planet Earth -- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off. Viewing the screen, it now reads. Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling. They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we -- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi screeches to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away.",
    "938": "Watson yanks out the large splinter of wood, and Holmes drinks the contents of the vial Watson handed him. It appears to have no effect, but suddenly, Holmes opens his eyes wide and stares around wildly, then leaps to his feet. Holmes relaxes a little as Watson examines his foot, and Watson smiles wistfully for a moment. Watson tosses down a medical instrument and looks down thoughtfully, exchanging a surprised look with Sim, then regards Holmes for a moment before leaning back against the side of a boxcar with a resigned expression. In Switzerland, an imposing castle is perched on a mountainside, saddling a massive waterfall. Delegates are arriving at the castle, expanding their back falls, which tumble hundreds of feet vertically down the mountainside. A horse-drawn sleigh arrives with Moriarty aboard, who has an elegant figure with a top hat and overcoat. He gets out of the sleigh and goes into the castle, where the Maitre D' has a book containing photos of all the delegates and identifies and welcomes him. Moriarty steps forward. In a ballroom, elegant couples in evening wear or military dress uniform dance across the floor. Holmes, Mycroft, the others, and Watson stand at the edge of the dance floor, all wearing white tie and tails. Samantha is wearing a deep red dress. Holmes holds his hand out, Sim takes it, and they step onto the dance floor, whirling around in circles along with the other couples. Holmes looks a bit out of place, his face unshaven and heavily bruised, as he observes the other people in the room. He notices details like a man's hand resting on the hilt of a sword, a woman's necklace, a man's medals, a military man holding a wine glass, and an eye crossing a white uniform. Holmes scans the people's faces until his eyes settle on a man in a black uniform with a facial scar. Holmes looks thoughtfully at Sim, steers her back over to Watson, and gestures to him. Arm in arm, Watson and Sim take to the dance floor while Holmes works on the man's face, and a man is chloroformed. Watson nods as Holmes walks over to a footman in 18th-century costume with a white parted wig and hands him a letter. The footman nods and takes it as Holmes leaves the ballroom. Watson walks over to Sim and whispers in her ear, and she looks surprised. Meanwhile, Moriarty chats with a delegate wearing an orange sash when the footman approaches him and hands him Holmes' letter. Moriarty reads it and looks around in concern.",
    "1387": "Snape waves the moth away, blows out a candle, and a slide show begins, displaying an ancient woodcut of a horrific beast at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at his book while the class stares mutely at a slide of an attacking werewolf; Hermione waits desperately for someone to respond to Snape's question. The moth flutters by Harry, releasing a tiny cloud of moth dust into the air, which Harry lifts his palm to. Meanwhile, Malfoy's parchment reappears, and Harry stares at it, observing a crude caricature of himself in Quidditch robes being struck by lightning repeatedly. Later, Harry opens his eyes as Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione slowly come into focus, standing at the foot of his bed in the hospital wing. As Harry edges up against his pillow, a nurse in the background removes the spokes of an umbrella from a Hufflepuff player's neck, prompting uncomfortable glances. Someone tips a bag of splintered wood and twisted twigs onto his bed. As Harry stares, a gentle wind can be heard, then Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question and sets Hedwig free of her traces. As she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the lake's edge. The great doors open and Fred and George enter, dropping the Invisibility Cloak to reveal a cross-looking Harry. Fred slaps a worn roll of parchment into Harry's hand, which he unfurls to find it blank until George touches his wand to the parchment, causing intricate ink lines to surface and spread like veins. Harry reads the curious words at the top. A trapdoor lifts, and Harry's eyes appear as he pulls himself up, but a door bangs open. Quickly, Harry hides and watches a man's boots descend the stairs as Malfoy's eyes shift and regard Hermione with disgust. Suddenly, SPLAT! Malfoy takes a snowball to the grill and splutters. Malfoy glances about in confusion when two more snowballs hit him. Hermione and Ron glance about uneasily as Crabbe and Goyle start for them, but then FLUMPH! their knees buckle and they fall headfirst into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully, eyeing the mist, when his ski mask is pulled over his eyes, he's spun about, kicked roughly, and sent stumbling over the rise and out of sight. Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance, and dash off, but go flying and land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up, they hear laughter, and Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion. The Invisibility Cloak drops to reveal a grinning Harry, who is smiling as the trio trudge through the swirling snow.",
    "918": "In the hallway, Barton sees the rugged man behind him. The stranger stops. Behind Barton, the stout, baby-faced man steps into the hall and shoots him. The G-man lurches and falls. In the street, Purvis turns. The shooter and his rugged associate leave. Outside, Purvis races toward the building. Baum whips out his gun, then peers at a car parked in the alley. Inside, Purvis enters the hallway and raises his gun. He advances cautiously. Purvis stops, looking down. Glancing whirly ahead, he crouches. Purvis' mouth drops open as he stares downward. On the floor, a blood pool spreads beneath Barton. As the wounded man twitches feebly, Purvis watches with a clenched jaw. His expression grows solemn. He glares down the hall. He rises, leaving a lifeless Barton. Outside, Baum sees two men hurrying down the alley steps. The baby-faced shooter raises a Tommy gun. The G-man ducks behind a wall as bullets pepper its surface. Scrambling out, he takes cover behind a garden planter. As the two criminals get into the parked car, Baum pops up and returns fire. The car pulls away. Back indoors, Purvis bursts into the apartment. He ignores the panic maul and leans out an open window. As the car below quits the alley, Purvis shoots, then hurries out of the apartment. Outside, two agents pull their car up as their superior exits the building. Purvis stops, staring with his mouth agape. The agent shifts his rueful gaze. With a slow, deliberate stride, Purvis steps closer to his men. Purvis' frustrated gaze scans the agents. His breath puffing visibly in the night air, he steps away. A bank's doors open. Three men in long coats enter. Our gaze drifts up to find Pete between Dillinger and a heavyset thug. The two leaner men split off together. Pete encounters a guard, sucker punches him, and bangs his head against the counter. Without breaking his stride, Dillinger draws a gun in each hand. The bankers all obey. Pete shifts his aim. A banker leads Dillinger to a vault. Now in his office, Hoover talks on the phone. Hoover shifts his resentful gaze and works his jaw. In Chicago, Purvis grimly lowers the phone, then shifts his troubled gaze. A locomotive pulls into a station. Puffs of brake steam blast the unfazed travelers and workers on the platform. The heavy wheels slow to a halt. An older, smartly dressed man with wizened features disembarks flanked by two associates. He peers down the platform through beady eyes. The three newcomers make their way down the platform, suitcases in hand. Travelers mill about on the vast terminal's marble floors. The three arriving men pause, taking in their surroundings. Now at a shoeshine stand.",
    "830": "A black sedan pulls into an empty car park in the early morning light. A couple. At work. A warehouse. He's in the toilet. In Harken's office, Harken pours Nick a big measure of whiskey from a cut-glass decanter and hands it to him. The tumbler is nearly full. Nick frowns. Nick stares. Nick starts for the door. Harken watches from behind his desk as Nick picks up the tumbler of whiskey and glugs it all in one go. It spills down his chin as he drains the glass. At the dentist's, bearded Dale is assisting his attractive boss, Julia, with a patient. A spraying device. She sprays Dale's crotch. Julia stands up. She administers gas. Kurt's boss, Jack, opens his car door. Jack drives away from the chemical company. Kurt spins around. Kurt is with Dale. Kurt spots a hot chick. The premises of Comnidyne. Staff are gathered in a meeting room. Nick leafs through documents. Nick puts down his documents. Nick winks at a colleague. Nick drags Harken through the office by his tie. Nick smashes him through a window. He plummets onto the roof of a parked car. Colleagues clap and cheer. Nick snaps to from his reverie. Nick chases after him. Harken stares blankly. Nick glares stony-faced as Harken creases up. Harken turns back. Harken steps closer. Harken turns and walks away. Brow furrowed, Nick looks at the floor. Kurt shows up for work at Pellit and Sons. As he takes off his jacket, Jack's son, Bobby, scoots back in his black leather office chair and glowers. He's short with a goatee, a high forehead, and wispy, thin comb-over. He scoots back into the office. Kurt goes through to him. A guy in a wheelchair. She's practically nude. Julia locks Dale in. She's wearing nothing but lacy knickers, stockings, and suspenders beneath an open lab coat. She smirks. He sidles nervously to a chair and sits down. She slowly runs her fingers along his beard and then his chest. She clutches his balls. She lets go. He frantically rattles the handle of the locked door. He exits. Night, at the bar. Kenny takes the cash they offered and goes. Dale is filling out a form in the dentist's office when he suddenly has his eyes covered. Julia gives smiley blonde Stacy a hug. They turn to a troubled-looking Dale, who forces a smile. Off they go. Stacey is gassed. Julia dives for Dale's crotch. A tablet computer. She holds it up. Compromising photos of Julia faking a variety of sex acts with an unconscious Dale. Doggy style. She winks and leaves the room. Exasperated, Dale's eyes rove in thought. His car screeches to a halt, mounting the curb as he parks outside Nick's place.",
    "1041": "He strides to the elevator and presses the Call button. He presses his earpiece and enters the elevator. As he exits, he hears two other colleagues, Holden and Matthews, with Taylor. Barnes strides past them. Taylor follows him to a car. They all move to cars as President Ashton emerges from the elevator. The President gets into the car by which Barnes and Taylor are standing. They follow him in. The convoy, headed by the two motorcycles, sets off from the underground garage. Behind the motorcycles is a police car, then two four-by-fours with their tailgates open. Then two stretch limos with more vehicles bringing up the rear. Armed police line the route. Armed men in uniform are on rooftops and behind barred gates. In the Presidential limo, Taylor grins. Protesters grow rowdy as the motorcade passes them. The convoy stops by a statue of Pizarro at Spain. The Secret Service agents spill out. His car door is opened. Taylor and Barnes climb up. Barnes scowls as he scans the press photographers. His narrow face is permanently grim as he turns from the cameras and walks around the car to join Taylor and the President. Taylor and Barnes lead the way. The President is behind them. Holden and Matthews bring up the rear. Taylor glances across at Barnes as the group makes their way to the plaza. They emerge through an archway of the crowded plaza. The President strides towards a child in its mother's arms. He shakes the baby's hand. He greets the flag-waving crowd, grasping hands as he passes. Barnes spots a man wearing dark glasses slip his hand into an inside pocket. The man's camera drops to the ground. The presidential party continues, Holden replacing Barnes at the front. Barnes now behind the President. Two soldiers on the roof. President Ashton climbs red-carpeted steps onto a podium placed in the middle of the plaza, which is filled with a flag-waving, cheering crowd free from protesters. The balding man now walks to a lectern. Barnes and Taylor stride across the podium and stand facing out towards the sea of yellow and red flags. Standing amongst the crowd is a chunky man in a blue and white checked shirt. He holds a video camera. Barnes notices a curtain twitch on an upper floor. Taylor follows Barnes' gaze. Barnes goes to speak into a mic in his cuff, but stops. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the window and the curtain. He speaks into his mic. Taylor and Barnes exchange a look. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt pointing his camera at the upper floors behind him to where Barnes saw the fluttering curtain. The man turns back around checking his camera.",
    "376": "Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement as they get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar. Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door and steps onto the porch. The boards squeal and creak, but he continues on. A cat screams out from a broken wicker rocker. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. The doorknob is ancient brass with two projections that look like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally, impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an old woman with a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down. Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead, but suddenly, he's back at the gate. The old woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow. We rush in on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees. An old man -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls, dead. We rush in on Don Price as twenty-year-old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout, very much dead. Don and Zacky both tremble with fear, the latter has tears in his eyes. The brothers suddenly bolt, still standing next to the old woman, Edward smiles. Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him. The old woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him. She smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth, then turns leaning her face right in front of his. On a silent count of one, two, three, Edward looks into the eye. This time we don't cut, instead we hold on Edward as he witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused. The old woman nods, heading back to the house. Dr. Julius Bennett (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs. He judges her belly and leans close to her, whispering in her ear. She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. They creak with every step. The wall is filled with family photos of happier times, mostly pictures of Will starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step. A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.",
    "854": "He saunters up to her as she takes another drag on her cigarette. Charlie grins, reaches in her overall pocket, and takes out a pack, holding it out for him to take one. He points at his map, and Jeep sees them while holding an old wooden cot, stares at them, then walks away. Charlie puffs on her cigarette. In the diner, Audrey sits alone as Sandra squeezes cream into Howard's cupped hand, and he rubs it in. Charlie leads a tall, black, 30'ish Kyle inside, and Audrey looks up with interest. Kyle glances at the other three diners, then follows Charlie to the counter, all eyes on him. The scruffy, unshaven Bob tilts his head to one side. In the garage, Jeep is cleaning the cot, and Bob strides over, sees the old cot on a bench, and stares at his son. They're outside as Jeep glares at his father, who shakes his head. Jeep looks down and away from Bob, then glances at his father, who screws up his eyes, and Jeep lowers his eyes. Bob pats him affectionately on the cheek, and Jeep watches his father go. As Bob enters the diner, Howard turns to him, and Bob holds his thumb and forefinger close together. He sees static on the television screen, and outside, Jeep's attention is drawn to something down the road. Jeep steps forward and glances at the horizon, where an anomalous-growing dark cloud fills it. Inside, Bob steps up on a chair to examine the TV set, while Jeep looks in the opposite direction, finding another encroaching black cloud dominating the horizon there. Others look at the screen, and Kyle proffers money. Percy switches on a radio and tries tuning it in, as Charlie's eyes venture to the TV. Sandra gets to her feet, and all six of them are still as they stare at the TV, four standing, with Audrey and Howard sitting. Kyle is on the phone in the back and removes his hat when Bob had switched off the television. In the garage, Jeep is looking at the apparently pristine top of the Beamer's engine block and its air intake, feeling hopeless. An old white Ford Sedan turns off the road and heads towards the petrol pumps, passes them, and draws to a halt outside the diner. The driver's door opens, and the wheels and stanchions of a Zimmer frame are plunked on the rocky ground as an elderly woman with white hair and a pink cardigan emerges from the car, walks a little, then shuts the door. Jeep looks curiously around as the old woman's shadow is cast on the diner door. She opens the door and shuffles in with the aid of the Zimmer, and Kyle and Percy glance around. Charlie spots her as Audrey glances up at the old woman, who grins and looks over at Howard and Sandra.",
    "977": "As he passed his door's room, the old man calls out to him. Grainy footage of him getting zapped. Benjamin stares at doors who looks around thoughtfully. Benjamin walks on up the corridor. He stops outside the door to his room and stands looking pensive. It's dark as Benjamin walks up outside Thomas's house and knocks on the door. A servant walks to the front door, pulling up his braces. The servant opens the door and directs Benjamin up the stairs. Benjamin opens the door of Thomas's room and goes inside. Thomas is asleep in bed. Benjamin gently shakes him. As the very first rays of dawn light creep across the sky, Thomas's car pulls up outside the country house. The chauffeur and Benjamin get out of the car. As Benjamin walks around the vehicle, the chauffeur helps Thomas out of the car. With the sky tinged orange, Benjamin wheels Thomas along in a wheelchair. They come to a halt. The chauffeur waits in the car and pulls his cap over his eyes. In front of the lake house, Benjamin lifts Thomas out of the wheelchair and carries him over his shoulders down to a jetty which leads out into the waters of the vast lake. He carefully sets Thomas down and lowers him onto a wooden seat. Benjamin pats Thomas on the shoulder and takes a seat behind his father. Thomas sits looking out across the expanse of water towards the dawn on the far horizon. He nods to himself as he takes in the view. Thomas closes his eyes and sighs. He and Benjamin are silhouetted against the rising sun. An assortment of buttons is swept off a table into a jar. Thomas lies dead on a table. An undertaker places the jar of buttons on Thomas's stomach. Benjamin and an elderly Queenie visit him as he lies in an open casket in an ornate chapel at rest. He holds out his arm. She takes it. The exterior of the majestic theater on Broadway, a yellow cab pulls up outside the theater. Benjamin gets out clutching a bunch of flowers. He pays the cab driver and goes into the theater. Benjamin steps into the darkened auditorium. On stage, a woman in a headdress is lifted up by two men who exit stage right. Certain beautiful with a long plaited ponytail, Daisy takes to the stage with her dance partner. Benjamin watches as the man raises her aloft like the thicker head of a ship against the painted backdrop of a stormy ocean. Benjamin, no longer wearing spectacles, takes a seat and stares fixedly at them as the dancer turns gracefully with Daisy reclining in his arms. The spotlights shift to follow their movements as they prance left and right.",
    "684": "A convertible smashes into a chasing police car, which is drawn alongside, then heads straight for Peter. Peter leaps in the air over the convertible, completes a backwards somersault, and lands, poised. The car chase is still on. One of the guys in the convertible pumps a shotgun. The leading police car spins. The second hits it. The third swerves to avoid it. It catapults into the air and drops towards a group of bystanders. It stops, suspended above them. Cowering, they all look closely at the squad car seemingly hanging in midair. It's caught in a web. Spider-Man swings past. Spider-Man slips between the cab and trailer of a truck as he pursues the convertible. Spider-Man soars, dives, and weaves to avoid the bullets being pumped directly at him. He fires two web pulls. He lands on the car's boot. He ensnares the men's weapons in their hands and tosses them over an overhead light, the men still attached. On stage, MJ stares at Peter's empty seat. Peter screeches up to the theater in the convertible. Peter leaves the car, then enters the theater. Peter bends down to tie his shoelace, watched by the usher, then straightens up. His tie is crooked. The usher in a waistcoat and dicky bow points to his tie. Peter straightens his necktie, then steps forward. He produces the ticket. The usher folds his arms. Peter walks to the door, then turns back. The usher gestures, locking his mouth. Peter looks at his ticket and glares at him. Peter sits on a stoop opposite the theater. A nearby street musician plays. Peter watches her, then closes his eyes and shakes his head incredulously. He steps forward, watching expectantly. MJ comes out through the stage door. A girl comes out after her. Peter smiles contentedly. Peter's smile fades as he sees the guy kissing MJ. Peter watches a police car fly past, followed by a few more. His attention returns to MJ. Then he looks down sadly and moves off. MJ and her man walk off, arm-in-arm. MJ looks around briefly as if expecting to see Peter, but there's nobody there. Peter enters a steam-filled backstreet. He breaks into a run, then tears open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man costume. He pulls on the red mask, leaps into the air, casting a web line to pull himself up. Later, a group of squad cars weave their way down a wide city street. Above them, Spider-Man swings from building to building. Hanging mid-swing, he flicks his wrists. He falls 10 stories, landing on some metal. He hauls himself up from the now dented pipe. He takes off his Spider-Man mask and examines his wrist.",
    "224": "Everett gives her an ingratiating laugh and ostentatiously fans some of his money, while she watches him do so. The big man, who appears as she leaves, stops chewing and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty pat. Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair, and Everett rises and digs in his pocket. As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a tilt of the head and a crinkling smile. Meanwhile, Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue, narrowing his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting at. Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it, glaring around the table, as Eckard grunts and starts to rise, only for Pappy to whip him back down with his hat. Eckard, upon settling back, looks around the table and helpfully relays information. The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak, where Everett, Delmar, and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of chicken off a bone, tossing the bone over his shoulder, belching, and sighing. Delmar is pleased and embarrassed, rising to his feet and tossing down his napkin. He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off a tree, casually stripping its twigs. He swings at Delmar, who staggers back with a grunt, as Everett wears a puzzled smile. Though stunned, Delmar is faster to size things up and charges Big Dan, wrapping his arms around him. Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head, while Everett remains puzzled but willing to be instructed. Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still attached to him like a hunting dog locked onto a bear, taking a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow to Everett, which catches him on the chin and sends him reeling. Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away, whacking Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then pawing through his pockets. He walks over to Delmar, who is on the ground moaning, and kicks him several times, taking Delmar's shoebox and flipping off the top to reveal a bed of straw with the toad resting on it. He pokes around the straw with his finger, finding nothing else inside, as Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes. Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist, and Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips as Big Dan squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against a tree.",
    "686": "The sphere begins to spin as Rosie approaches Octavius and smiles, with Octavius smiling back and taking a pair of dark goggles from her. He puts the high-tech goggles on and taps keys on a control panel. Laser projectors mounted at the top and bottom of each curved pillar fire slender yellowish beams through the tiny sphere, causing it to glow and spin faster until it suddenly expands into a fiery ball resembling the Sun. An old scientist speaks to Harry while the mechanical arms grasp an energy field surrounding the glowing sphere. Peter looks down and sees a paper clip lift off the floor, shooting towards the fusion machine, as the air ducts and hanging lights swing towards it. Peter stares up, bathed in an orange glow, while Octavius, looking a little flustered, taps on the control panel again. Necklaces and other personal objects get sucked into the sphere, and Octavius peers around at his anxious-looking wife as Peter moves away and Harry looks around. Metal panels are sucked off the walls, an arc of white-hot energy blasts out of the sphere, cutting into the ceiling, and an equipment unit rolls towards Harry until Spider-Man swings him to safety. Spider-Man then leaps onto the ceiling as Octavius looks up and swings a mechanical arm at him, knocking him against the wall. A small energy arc leaps out from the sun's sphere, causing the windows to implode and shards of glass to fly towards Octavius' wife, her face reflected in one of them, heading straight for her eye. Octavius sees her slump to the floor, and an arc of energy surges from the sphere, short-circuiting the inhibitor chip. Spider-Man leaps over to the far cables, tugs on them as sparks fly out, and Octavius' body stops shaking and drops to the floor along with the mechanical arms. The power cables come away, and Spider-Man backflips onto the floor as the sphere implodes, bursts into a cloud of fiery particles, and implodes again, filling the land with darkness. Emergency vehicles arrive at the scene, with two singed scientists leaving the building, while Harry trudges onto the street with an angry expression. An Oscorp exec is present as Rosie's dead body, covered on a stretcher trolley, is wheeled over to an ambulance. Without a scratch, Peter wanders out of the building. At a hospital, medics are about to operate on an unconscious Octavius when the doctor points to graphics on a screen, showing Octavius' mechanical limbs suspended from the ceiling. The doctor starts up a circular saw but stops, hearing a sound, and looks up to see a pulley hanging from the ceiling swinging. Edgy, the doctor prepares to cut one of the limbs, but as he lowers the blade, he sees something reflected in another medic's goggles.",
    "558": "Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides. He sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard and lunges for it. He snatches up the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. Indy struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him as several more drums come his way. Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch, then sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him, before jumping into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the Cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky. As bits of debris fall from the sky like rain, Indy bobs up in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths, while dressed in professorial tweeds, Indy stands before his class, where there is laughter. Marcus Brody approaches Indy's classroom and peers through the window in the door to see Indy completing his lecture. Brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room as Indy stands at his desk and students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk as Brody approaches, and the last of the students leaves the lecture hall. Indy removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk, places it on the desk, and takes off his glasses as Brody examines the Cross. Indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door, turning back toward Brody, now holding the Cross. Indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his private office, where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it. Indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the window, slides it open, and steps out into the garden. He escapes through the garden and walks briskly toward the street, smiling and enjoying his freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a long black Packard sedan pulls up before him and three men step out. Indy is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone amid numerous museum-quality artifacts displayed around the room. After a moment, Walter Donovan enters from across the room, and during the brief time that the door is open, we hear a cocktail party going on in the next room with voices and soft sounds.",
    "1113": "Lockhart flies upwards, hits the roof of the cave and falls. The cave roof starts to collapse. The passage between Ron and Harry is completely blocked. Harry peers through a tiny gap in the rocks. Lying on the ground, Lockhart smiles vacantly. He picks up a stone. Ron grabs the stone and hits him over the head with it. Harry climbs over fallen rocks. Holding his wand in his hand, he starts to explore the cave. On the wall ahead, he sees a circular hinged door decorated with a pattern of snakes. He goes towards it, and starts to speak. One snake glides around the circumference, unlocking the mechanism. The heavy metal door swings open. Holding his wand as protection, Harry walks warily through the circular opening of the long and narrow tunnel. He climbs down the few rungs of a short metal ladder and jumps off at the bottom. He finds himself in a long, damp chamber. Ahead of him runs a wide paved path lined on either side by huge carved snake heads, their stone mouths gaping open. Harry walks towards the massive carved head of a bearded man illuminated with a green light. The head is reflected in the water beneath. He sees the still figure of a girl lying on the wet stone floor. He runs towards her and kneels beside her. Her face is pale and her eyes are closed. Harry looks around and sees Tom Riddle in the shadows. He picks up Harry's wand. Harry gets up and holds out his hand. He writes fiery letters in the air with Harry's wand. Harry stares at him. They glare angrily at each other. They both look up. The phoenix drops something into Harry's hand. The handsome bird swipes away down the chamber. Harry unrolls the crumpled sorting hat and looks at it in surprise. Riddle stretches out his hand. The mouth of the huge bearded statue starts to open. Harry watches in fascinated horror as the huge stone mouth opens wider and wider. A gigantic serpent slithers out. Harry drops the hat and runs. The serpent splashes through the water beneath the statue. It slithers ominously after Harry, who trips and falls. Harry cowers, protecting his head, as the serpent prepares to strike. Fawkes suddenly reappears. The phoenix flies at the serpent's head, flapping its wings; the brave bird pecks repeatedly at the other creature's huge yellow eyes. Riddle calls out angrily. Fawkes swoops off. Harry scrambles to his feet. He backs away as the serpent thrashes his head. The serpent feels his footsteps and lunges forward. Harry makes a dash for it. He splashes through a shallow pool with the huge serpent close behind him.",
    "1101": "They straighten up. As Smokie stares down the rifle's barrel, he reconsiders. Spider lets go of Thao, and he and his buddies retreat to his car. Walt keeps the gun trained on them as they go. Thao rejoins his family. Walt heads back into his house. Sue, Thao, and the others go back to theirs. Walt is at the kitchen sink. Hearing something, he picks his rifle up from beside his cooker and goes out onto the porch to investigate. He looks surprised to find some of his neighbors laying gifts of food and flowers on his front steps. The Hmongs leave. Walt stares at the platters of food with distaste. He puts them all in the trash. He sees more of his neighbors approaching with gifts. He intercepts Sue and Thao. He looks sheepishly at Walt. Walt marches back to his house. Sue, her mother, and Thao get back to theirs. Sue turns back to look at Walt. Father Janovich finds Walt sitting on his porch, smoking his cigarette. Walt gets up. Father Janovich nods slightly. Walt is at the barber's. Sue is with a white boy, Trey. They approach three black youths. As the black guys hassle Sue and Trey, Walt pulls up at the junction in his pickup. Walt watches thoughtfully. Looking uneasy, Walt drives across the junction. Walt pulls up beside them. The black guys notice Walt. Walt steps out of his pickup. Chewing on a plug of tobacco, he squares up to the three black guys. He spits. Walt points his finger like a gun. He cocks his thumb. The guys hold Sue back. Walt pulls a Colt .45 pistol. Trey hurries off, and Walt puts his gun away. He turns to the black guys. He turns back to his pickup. Walt looks menacingly back at them. He gets in the truck with Sue in the passenger seat. Walt drives off in a leisurely, unhurried fashion. Walt nods thoughtfully. Walt sits down on his porch with a newspaper. He sees the elderly grandma from next door looking over at him. He picks up his glasses and puts them on to read the paper. He looks down at Daisy. Disgruntled, he looks across the street at a white woman unloading groceries from her car. She drops them. Three passing Hmong youths make no attempt to help her. One of them mimes shagging her. He sits back down as Thao helps the woman. Walt puts his glasses down and picks up a mug. He takes a drink. Walt looks over at the old lady next door, and she gives him a nod. With big buttons. Cigarettes. Walt looks furious. Walt puts away a photo of his wife.",
    "617": "She looks at the floor. He raises his glass, then turns away, popping the fangs back in his mouth as he makes his way through the crowd. Alison has her back to him. A morose Sydney sits alone at the table, his goblet-like glass in front. Vincent and Elena sit in the back. Elena winds the window down. Vincent leans forward. Sydney steps back from the car window and knits his hands together by his chin. Drenched by the rain, he stares at them with window glides up. Elena smiles at the driver. The car pulls away, leaving a dispirited Sydney at the roadside, his hands clasped together, as if in prayer. His long cape hangs in a puddle on the pavement. He looks up at an electronic billboard from which Sophie stares at him. She blows a kiss. Breathing heavily, he hangs his head as the rain beats down on the dark street. In Clayton's office, Sydney smiles. Dressed in a sharp pin-striped suit and dark glasses, Sydney sits opposite Vincent in a sushi bar, hurriedly taking notes and smiling enthusiastically at Vincent's comments. Elena goes through Sydney's article, editing out the parts she doesn't like. She hands it back to him. He nods with a grateful smile as he looks it over. Sydney stands behind Elena and a dark-haired woman as they airbrush Vincent's publicity photographs on a computer. They digitally remove a pimple. Sydney takes a copy of Sharp's magazine from a news kiosk on a street corner. He flips through it to find his article. A broad smile spreads over Sydney’s face. Sydney works at his computer in an office, his own. Over time, it fills up with various gift baskets. A female property agent shows Sydney around a spacious apartment. Someone hands Sydney a gift box at his desk, the new Omega Speedmaster watch. He takes off his old watch and flings it. Sydney's name is taped on a number of guest lists. Getting on like a house on fire, Sydney and Clayton share a joke in the lift. Wearing a white robe, Sydney sits in a steam room. A wide smile plays on his lips. Alison reads an article on Sydney in a magazine. She's sitting at a restaurant table. Lawrence joins her. On it is a white Russian cocktail. He reads over her shoulder. Lawrence removes his arm from around her shoulder, picks up his drink and takes a sip. As he walks away, Alison glances down at her novel and frowns. The exterior of Sydney's apartment building. Alison is inside the building. Wearing a stripey robe, Sydney opens his door. Alison nods. Alison throws her head back with a sigh as he fetches some documents.",
    "199": "He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower, sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu. George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed. They whisper. Mary comes in and picks up the phone. George enters shot and stands listening to her, then snatches the phone from Mary. She puts a restraining hand on his arm, but he shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand and speaks quickly into the phone. But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling. Mary once more tries to take the phone from him. But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone. He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner, and Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously. The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only sound being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up—a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely, he kicks over the models, picks up some books, and hurls them into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified. George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious outburst. There is silence in the room until Janie breaks into sobs. The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for George, so he looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house. Mary goes to the phone and picks it up. Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him, signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow. George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up the phone and dials. George is out of the door by now. The camera moves closer to Potter. George comes out of the bank into the falling snow, crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off. The place is an Italian restaurant with a bar, the bottles sparkle, and there are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, more like a party than a public drinking place.",
    "434": "Charlie puts on his hat and leaves. Eddie empties his glass and slaps it on the shelf next to Sarah. She pours it out, saying nothing. Sarah hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye. She pours herself a very stiff drink as Eddie moves about restlessly. Sarah drinks her drink. Still drinking, she turns to him. They embrace and kiss one another without putting down their glasses. The room is a mess and Sarah is drunk. She sits on her knees on the floor, pecking at the keys of her typewriter with one finger. Her bottle and her glass are beside her. A bare-chested Eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag. He carelessly wipes the sink, then throws down the dishrag and goes to the closet, pulling out his leather case. Reaching for the bottle, Sarah abruptly lurches forward over her typewriter, and knocks the bottle over. Eddie stares at Sarah as she sways limply on her knees, unmindful of her open robe. Eddie picks up the bottle and sets it before her. Taking her ashtray, Eddie rises, runs his hand through her hair for a moment, and then carries off the ashtray and empties it in the garbage bag. Sarah, still hopelessly drunk, is sprawled out on her bed, futilely attempting to dial a telephone. Eddie, in a clean shirt and pants, watches her. He sets the bottle down near the typewriter and notices the sheet of paper stuck in the typewriter's carriage. He bends down to read it. She falls back on the bed. Eddie pulls the paper out of the carriage and reads it. He thinks for a moment, then angrily crumples the paper in his hands and throws it at her. Eddie walks off. Eddie gives her a look, then lowers his eyes. Eddie turns and slaps her on the cheek. He reaches for his jacket. As Eddie pushes through the glass doors to the front room of Johnny's bar, he looks around at the unused pool tables, then goes to the bar. A man in a business suit comes out of the back room and joins him at the bar. The man looks to the bartender for his answer. Eddie takes his beer to the back room. The poker game is in progress. Four men are playing. One of them is Bert Gordon. His glass of milk is beside him on the table. He takes note of Eddie's presence with a quick dart of his eyes. Eddie takes a seat next to Bert. As the cards are dealt, Eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.",
    "1230": "Ben's smart saloon pulls up outside an olive green clapboard house with a white picket fence. A black and white Great Dane stands barking at him in the garden. Ben gets out of the car, and locks it with a remote. Dressed in a smart suit and tie, Ben goes to the fence but stops short and stares at the dog. A neighbor who is gardening spots him. Ben parks on an upper story of a car park, which looks onto St. Matthew Medical Center. Ben enters the center and goes to a blonde middle-aged woman on the reception desk. Ben's in a lift. He stands aside as two doctors wearing stethoscopes get in with him. Ben holds back the door. Emily gets in. They all face the front. Then Ben turns and studies Emily for a long moment. His expression concerned. Emily, who is slender and wearing a nightdress, gets out of the lift and walks listlessly down a hospital corridor. Ben waits and stops the lift door closing with the briefcase he's carrying. He gets out of the lift and follows Emily at a discreet distance. He stops at double doors and looks through the glass panes in them. He sees Emily, who is wearing UGG boots with her nighty, shuffle down onto a ward. Ben follows her. Emily's image blurs. She passes a reception desk, then rounds a corner and disappears. Ben approaches the desk. Ben smiles and gives the stout nurse a brief wave as he heads away. His smile fades as he walks. A clip attached to Emily's forefinger attaches her to an electrocardiograph machine. 30-something Emily lies asleep in her hospital bed in shadowy light. Ben stands in the doorway watching her intently. His expression sad. As she stirs, Ben makes a swift but calm exit. Emily glimpses him. She sits up and stares after him. Emily frowns and looks puzzled. Ben's car is parked in the dark, wet night. He sits at the wheel, deep in solemn thought as the wipers sweep back and forth. Ben addresses colleagues in a small conference room at Apogee Aeronautics. He points to a rocket model. Ben checks a message on his BlackBerry. Ben drives a Corvette sports car. He enters the beach house and puts down his things. She's on the patio, looking out to sea. Ben lies lethargically on his couch, staring at his mobile phone on the coffee table. He picks the mobile up. Ben snaps his mobile shut and throws it down. Ben drives his saloon along the sunny coast road from the beach house. He pulls up in a parking spot outside a large institutional-looking building with the stars and stripes hanging over the door.",
    "336": "DEAGOL pulls on his rod, but is hauled overboard and disappears underwater with a splash, while SMEAGOL leans over the boat. DEAGOL turns to look at him with a smirk on his face. SMEAGOL moves towards DEAGOL, and then jumps on him, strangling him and ripping the glittering ring from DEAGOL's limp hand. SMEAGOL slips the ring onto his finger, descending into madness as his body twists and distorts, becoming a creepy, shriveled wretch, and finally crawling into a dark cave beneath the Misty Mountains. A grim landscape, covered in thorn bushes and the scars of recent fires, surrounds the dark Morgul Valley as it disappears up towards the mountains. FRODO and SAM are in a filthy culvert; SAM twitches in a restless sleep, but FRODO is awake, his hand trailing down to the chain around his neck. A sudden hiss startles FRODO, who quickly hides the ring as GOLLUM peers at them with gleaming eyes. SAM stirs, looks at FRODO, who shakes his head. SAM then looks at the dead, brown twilight. The days are growing darker when the ground suddenly quivers, and a rolling, rumbling noise echoes down the valley. SAM shoots GOLLUM a hostile look and turns back to rummage in his knapsack, holding up a piece of dried lembas bread to FRODO. FRODO looks at SAM questioningly. FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM, clambering through bracken and over jagged rocks, as he leads them on a winding, torturous path. Meanwhile, GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN, and GIMLI through dark woodland as the moving forest of Fangorn opens before them, creating an avenue of trees that allows access along the old Isengard road. A thick, humid mist fills the forest, and as the forest separates ahead, the ruins of the great stone wall, cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards, are revealed. Far off, half veiled in swirling steam, stands the tower of Orthanc, unbroken by the storm, with pale waters lapping about its feet. Two small hobbits, MERRY and PIPPIN, sit on the smashed wall with a feast of breads, meats, and wine spread before them. They puff on long pipes as they lie back in the sun. MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond, as GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI stare at the sight before them. GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam floating upon the muddied waters surrounding the tower. TREEBEARD, the giant ENT, strides towards them, alarming all but GANDALF, who stares up the long length of the dark tower as the old ENT nods his head wisely. PIPPIN's eye is caught by something glowing with a golden light in the muddy waters. ARAGORN turns as, quick as a flash, PIPPIN has jumped off his horse and picked up the Palantír.",
    "685": "He leaps over the edge of the building and peers down at the street below. He tries to fire a web, but again nothing happens. He looks down at the street way below and waddles slightly. He pouts and frowns. Later, a man with a dog is waiting for an elevator. The doors open and the man is about to enter when he pauses, seeing a fully suited Spider-Man standing casually inside. Looking Spidey up and down, the man steps into the elevator and presses a floor button. Spider-Man looks down a little self-consciously. The man nods understandingly. The man puts his card back in his pocket. Spider-Man looks away from the man, then bows his head and stares at the wall. The man looks up at the floor display as it changes from 10 to nine. Spider-Man leans forward and presses a button. Later, Peter traipses down a deserted sidewalk. He passes a wall which has been plastered with MJ's perfume ads, showing her soft, pretty face. He looks at the images briefly, then carries on going, a preoccupied look on his face. He's dragging his broken moped along behind him. Peter sits doodling in Doctor Connors' class. He's drawn his face, half Peter Parker and half Spider-Man. On a pay phone outside, MJ comes home. MJ looks peeved. MJ gazes hopefully at the phone. She turns away. Peter slaps the phone, then shakes his head incredulously. Talking into the receiver, he looks up and shakes his head. He hangs up. Guests have gathered in Doctor Octavius' lab. Peter and Harry are amongst them. Octavius pulls off a dust sheet to reveal a device with four long mechanical limbs. He peels off his gray lab coat. He steps onto a platform, then taps keys on a freestanding control panel. The metal harness snaps into position around his waist. A mechanical spine curls up onto his back. A blue computer chip at the top of the synthetic spine glows, then a series of pins slide into his skin. He grimaces. His audience gasps. Octavius concentrates hard and stares up at the ceiling. The four metal limbs begin to move, rising up like snakes. On the end of each arm is a pointed pincer which opens out. Octavius reaches out his own arms. The four mechanical limbs hover above his head. Peter's eyes are wide. Equipment units are wheeled aside. The lights go out. Across the room stands a machine with a base from which four curved pillars rise. Octavius controls one of the mechanical arms. The pincer retracts. A much smaller pincer opens. A tube rises from a panel. The small pincer plucks a tiny sphere from inside it. The small pincer releases the sphere, which floats in the air between the four pillars of the machine.",
    "1094": "Bella walks up to Zus who is sitting on a log. Her dark hair cut short and wearing a grey wool coat, she sits down on the log, and they exchange a brief smile. Zus offers her a sip from his hip flask. She meets his playful expression with a shrug, and then a smile. She takes the flask and drinks from it. He looks, then lowers his eyes. His dark eyes hold her in his gaze, and she nods faintly. This time, she looks Zus straight in the eye. Tentatively, he raises his hand and touches her cheek with his fingers, gently pulling at her bottom lip with his thumb. She takes hold of his hand with her hand and places it on her right breast, discretely covering his hand with a coat and holding his gaze. Elsewhere, Aron and his friend, Rachel, tramp through the spindly birch trees. In the distance, they spot Kissely the milkman running ahead of a unit of armed men in black uniforms. The two youngsters dive behind a rock. Zus and Tuvia, their guns up and ready, urge the men and women to flee. And Benzion in a fur hat leads them across a shallow stream. Kissely and the policemen with guns arrive at the camp. One of the Bielski group carries a goat across the stream. A woman stumbles and falls into the water. Zus helps her up. Carrying bags and baskets, the people scramble up a slope. Tuvia and other men with guns scoot back down the hill to take up positions behind trees. The Russian policemen and helmeted soldiers come into view below them. Zus, Tuvia, and the others fire. One wounded soldier is helped away from the stream. The bearded milkman cowers behind a tree. Zus stops to reload. The policeman looks back at his half a dozen men. Zus hits the milkman's arm. Tuvia unleashes a salvo of bullets. The policeman skulking behind a tree calls to his men to go. Tuvia watches them retreating through the trees. He and the others stride forward in a line, and Zus reloads. Tuvia's cheeks tighten as he ponders his brother's words, but he runs off after the others. The displaced community of men, women, and children clutching their bundles of possessions, some in hats and coats, others in flat caps and jackets, many of the women with shawls on their heads tramp through the forest, dwarfed by the tall, thin, bare trees. They come out onto a meadow of tall grasses wafting in the breeze, walking almost in single file, like black shadows moving across the landscape. Tuvia and Ben Zion, behind them Zus with Bella by his side, lead the way out of the wood.",
    "1167": "Professor McGonagall and Ron help Harry to Dumbledore's study, where Ginny is present with the twins, and Dumbledore turns from the moving portraits to face Harry as Professor Snape approaches from behind. Snape takes Harry down to his storeroom, raises his wand, and Harry's body goes rigid; he gasps in agony as his mind fills with terrifying memories. The wind sends a flurry of snowflakes in all directions, and the snow begins to settle on the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School as the screen turns white. Children throw snowballs outside the London house, where the kitchen is decorated for Christmas, and Mr. Weasley is brought in, looking battered and bruised, sitting in a wheelchair and wearing a paper hat. Standing in the doorway, Sirius raises his glass and winks, donning a knitted jerkin. Harry finds a room where the walls are covered with a tapestry sewn with names and faces, the house elf startles him and skulks off, and Sirius's image has been burnt away. Sirius embraces Harry and hugs him affectionately before Harry joins Hermione. Sirius looks back at the family tree and his own obliterated face, then closes the door. A gray sky is reflected in the river as Hogwarts School stands high on the cliffs above. Harry chats with Cho as they walk through the courtyard until Hermione finds them, prompting Harry to turn to Cho and then hurry off with Hermione. Harry, Ron, and Hermione run down the hill towards Hagrid's cottage, where a faint plume of smoke rises from the chimney, and they hide as Umbridge comes out wearing a fluffy purple coat over her pink dress. She sniffs, wrinkles her nose, sprays herself with perfume, and then sprays a cross on the cottage door. Inside, Hagrid's face is red and bruised, holding a raw steak to his eye while the huge dog gobbles it eagerly, as the wind blows wisps of straw across the room and Hagrid looks out of the window. A flash of lightning reveals a snake tattooed on a man's arm that twists and writhes. A woman with wild hair runs her tongue over a snake tattooed on her arm, hears an explosion, and escapes through a gaping hole while wearing striped prison clothes. Dementors circle high above the prison, a colossal triangular tower surrounded by an angry sea. Neville slowly closes the newspaper at breakfast, as a cozy fire burns in the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Neville, who is looking at a photograph stuck up on the mirror, the photograph that Sirius gave Harry at the station, which includes Neville's parents as part of the group. Harry nods reassuringly and looks at his own parents. A horse, an otter for Hermione, a dog for Ron, and Luna produces a hare, which leaps joyfully over their heads, while Harry grins proudly as the chandelier begins to shake.",
    "280": "He listens and plays the recordings again, but decides they are no good and returns to his carpet sweeping. The camera pans farther left to the salesman's apartment where there are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted. The camera continues its pan to the left, including the couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather; the man is in the act of laying out the mattress. His wife, slightly younger and a peroxided, faded showgirl type, is also wearing pajamas with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket. She leans over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the floor of the courtyard. The couple, upon closer inspection, reveals the man is balding and middle-aged, and the woman, having been a one-time siffleuse, calls to the dog with a clarion and melodic tone. The man is wearing striped pajamas. The little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows and steps into the basket, which begins to move upward as the camera follows it. When the basket reaches the fire escape, the camera pans on to the apartment of Miss Torso who is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, her thoughts seemingly far away. The camera drops down to the apartment below, occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid, who is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. We see her activities inside the apartment for the first time as she wears a short smock, her legs still bare. Her sculpture takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved. The camera moves on much farther to the left and eventually rests on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade still drawn. It moves on and at last passes through Jeff's window, coming to rest on the two big heads of Jeff and Lisa. Her lips brush lightly against his cheek as she speaks, sitting on his sound knee with her arms around his neck. She starts kissing him but then gives up trying to interest him in romance and moves back from the embrace. Lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little, then turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in Jeff's observation about the salesman's life. However, her expression is disturbed as she watches Jeff. We see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness, faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. Jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then relaxes and smiles a little as Lisa stretches herself out on the divan.",
    "228": "Furniture, torn mattresses, and pillows lie scattered as feathers fly when he turns a corner and Szpilman comes into the courtyard. He stops, his face blank, seeing the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind, their two sons, and the toddler lying outside the door. Szpilman steps across the bodies, moving into a place where papers and pamphlets are strewn all over, and the mimeograph is smashed. Szpilman enters, stands surveying the devastation, shuffles along, and comes to a cafe. He goes inside to find a shambles and wanders through the upturned tables and broken chairs. He stops, looks about, turns, and makes for the door when he hears an urgent hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it and sees Benek hiding under the platform, beckoning to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until he's beside Benek, who replaces a plank, hiding them from view. Thin slivers of light illuminate the cramped space where the two men lie on their backs. Szpilman can't continue, and Benek nods in understanding. In bright sunlight, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen and guarded by two German policemen, as they are marched out of the ghetto gates. Street traders with baskets full of wares, such as fruit, vegetables, fish, and tins of preserves, engage with women who bargain and make purchases in a lively, colorful scene where dealers in gold and currency call monotonously. Szpilman tries to communicate with Janina, whose profile is to him, but she doesn't see him, so he goes back to work. The German policemen wander to one of the stalls to buy fruit, and, at that moment, two Jewish workers dash to another stall to buy bread. Szpilman glances across the square and sees that Janina is still at the stall. He makes a decision to jump down and rush toward Janina, but he stops dead when he sees that Janina is no longer there. Szpilman and Benek, as before, march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German policemen. A little later, Szpilman is seen mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back when the noise of airplanes overhead signals a swarm of Russian bombers amidst anti-aircraft fire and puffs of exploding shells. The workers look up, and so does Szpilman, causing the bricks to slide off his hod, crashing to the ground. An SS man, nicknamed Zick-Zack, approaches Szpilman with a whip. Szpilman goes to him, and Zick-Zack, enraged, grabs him by the hair, presses his head hard between his thighs, and beats him mercilessly. After enduring a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward, lying in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied, and two Poles, without armbands, one being Bartczak, drag him away to a wooden hut, which stores wood, nails, tools, paint, and metal brackets.",
    "128": "The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the ticket. Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the ticket. They are now close together. She kisses him. The redcap comes from inside the car. Redcap descends. Phyllis kisses Neff again quickly. She runs down the steps. The porter picks up the box. He and the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of the shot in the direction of the parked car. Neff and the porter. The conductor is going on into the car. Neff is half turned away from the porter. He holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through. Most of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man solicitously. Neff hobbles on through. Four or five passengers are reading or writing. Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car. Neff has come out and hobbled to the railing. He stands looking back along the rails. Neff stands silent. He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something. Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers. He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly swings his body over the rail. Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets go and drops to the right-of-way. The camera stops. The train recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side. Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out. He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot.",
    "1184": "Harry makes a grab but Malfoy spins out of reach, and Malfoy flings the Remembrall away with all his might. The glass bowl flies over and over in the air as Harry steers his broom, soaring towards a high stone tower. Upstairs in her study, Professor McGonagall sees Harry hackling towards her window, and just in time, he turns a neat somersault and catches the Remembrall, then tosses it victoriously into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and looks down into the courtyard as Harry rejoins the cheering first-years, while Malfoy and his cronies snigger. Still carrying his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall, who walks toward them, purposefully, and stops outside a classroom. The twins are there, and Hermione shows Harry a name on a Gryffindor Trophy. They go upstairs, and the staircase swings into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the door at the top of the stairs, and they see a statue covered in cobwebs. A torch flares, and the caretaker's scary red-eyed cat watches them run down a torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles with the latch, and taking out her wand, the door opens and they rush through. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern and peers around suspiciously, while in the middle of the room is a gigantic dog with three enormous heads and three sets of sharp, glistening teeth. The children rush for the door, and one of the slobbering heads is so enormous, it completely fills the doorway, but they slam the door shut. Daylight comes, and Oliver and Harry carry a trunk out into the school grounds. They set the trunk on the grass, and Oliver takes out a large, red ball. Chained down, two brown balls struggle to escape. Oliver gives Harry a wooden bat and then unchains one of the brown balls, which shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of sight. Harry swings the bat and knocks the ball high into the air, flying over the head of a statue on the battlements before the ball returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown ball knocks him to the ground. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the trunk and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden ball with delicate, golden wings that spring out of the snitch, and it flutters above Harry's head. Ron flicks his wand, and Hermione flicks her wand. A white feather rises from the desk and floats across the room towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a pile of books. Seamus' face is smudged with soot, and a smoldering feather sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard, Hermione hurries past, while the Great Hall is lit with flaming torches, and candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning pumpkins, which float above the heads of the students.",
    "960": "Jack gets back in the Jeep and, now on a main carriageway, unwittingly motors past Donnie, Joe, and the boys who are driving back to town. Donnie takes a sharp right onto a rough track through the trees, and as it's getting dark, they arrive back into town, driving until they reach Lillian Middle School. The boys leave Donnie in the car park and scramble over a chain link fence, running to a storage trailer. Joe begins prying a padlock on the trailer with a tire iron, and Martin opens it to reveal papers and rolls of film inside. They break into a classroom, where they find a photo of him and look at the footage. Scientists and military men are seen examining the wreckage of something big. Carrie puts a tape in a player, and on the film, Woodward is grabbed by a tentacle. Suddenly, Air Force soldiers burst in on the boys. In the car park, Donnie sits in the car smoking a joint, oblivious of the military activity around him. The soldiers march the boys into a corridor, where Colonel Nelec approaches them and finds Carrie's explosives in a rock sack. Nelec eyes Joe, and Overmyer finds Joe's mother's locket on him and takes it. The soldiers shepherd the boys onto a bus in the car park, and sitting in his car, Donnie watches as they're driven away. He gets on his CB radio. Still in Air Force uniform, Jack makes his way through the evacuation center, where a boy recognizes him, and he finds Preston reading a magazine. Meanwhile, the super eight footage of the alien is present. On the bus, Overmyer hands Colonel Nelec some paperwork, and the boys watch anxiously from a holding cell at the rear of the bus. Something hits the side of the bus, jolting it onto two wheels, and it continues along the road for a short way before righting itself, though one of its tires blows out. The driver brings the bus to a grinding halt on a remote road. Nelec hands a rifle to an apprehensive-looking Overmyer, and the senior airman driving the bus hesitates before reluctantly opening the door. Outside it's pitch dark, and clutching the rifle, Overmyer cautiously makes his way along the aisle of the bus towards the open door. As he nears the door, Overmyer stops, and a tentacle reaches into the bus, grabbing Overmyer and slapping him against the walls of the bus. The rifle goes off, hitting the window of the boys' holding cell, and Overmyer is dragged outside. Martin vomits as the senior airman restarts the bus's engine and it lurches into life. As he stamps on the throttle, the bus is tipped onto its side.",
    "270": "A squad car, its siren wailing, kicks up dust as it roars into the foreground. Hi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agent's desk. Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt, and Ed is in her dress blues. The agent looks, with a deadpan, from the file to Hi, his face still deadly neutral, then looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it to be a couple of feet long. Ed stares vacantly out the passenger window while they are driving. Hi looks from Ed out to the road. Over Hi's shoulder, he stares listlessly at himself in the mirror, a razor held forgotten in one hand, his face half-lathered and half-shaved. The bedroom is somewhat messy. Ed sits on the edge of the bed, also staring listlessly, her police uniform on but not yet buttoned, and her hands lie palm-up in her lap, like two dead fish. Hi works while his sweaty gum-chewing colleague stands idly by. Alone in his Chevy, he looks to the side at a 7-Eleven. Hi and Ed sit listlessly watching TV; Ed perks up reacting to something on TV. Hi notices her reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch a newscaster silently reading copy. Behind him, news footage of five nurses holding infants. Watching intently, Ed reaches her hand out to Hi, and he takes her hand in his. NATHAN ARIZONA, a stocky middle-aged man in a white polyester suit, gestures expansively with his white cowboy hat toward a one-story warehouse store with a football stadium parking lot, chroma-keyed in behind him. A businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine door as he turns to leave, and Hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five-finger discount copy. He flips the paper over to look at the headline, which reads: Arizona Quints Go Home. A pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together at home. They look from the paper to each other. In the middle of the desert, we float in toward Ed who is seated, waiting, in the driver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters the frame and cinches down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car, with pieces of red flag fluttering at either end of the ladder where it sticks out beyond the car. Hi gets in the car and it starts down the long, winding road leading away from the trailer, kicking up dust. Tableau of a couple at home.

    "917": "Dillinger wriggles his opened pants downward as Billie, kneeling over him, unfastens her dress and pulls it off over her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of Dillinger. Glimpses of Dillinger thrusting into Billie from behind are interspersed with their nuzzling face to face. A recent flashback shows them arriving ecstatically, and another flash shows Dillinger kissing her mouth as his face withdraws down her chest. Later, as they cuddle, they share a warm smile, and later still, Billie strolls in her slip to a window. Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes. Billie caresses their contents, then rejoins Dillinger in bed, laying her head on his shoulder. Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck, his thumb gently rubbing her graceful jaw line, while his gaze pours over her face. He grins, and Billie gazes dreamily at him. He gives her another smile, and his thumb caresses her cheek in a gentle rhythm, followed by a puckish grin. At the telephone exchange, Baum stands with a listening piece to his ear and a hand-held mike at his lips. Later, the Pierce-Arrow pulls up to a curb, with Purvis driving and Baum at his side. Two other G-men approach the luxury car, and one of the street agents looks to his young partner, who bows his hat. Purvis faces Baum, points, then gets out and faces the young G-man. Purvis leads them across the street towards a building, and inside, they enter a long, dim hallway. Purvis leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun as they prepare, dwarfing their trench-coated forms. Purvis lifts his knuckles to the door, which opens to reveal a young demure house dressed, with strawberry blonde hair framing her face in a curly bob. Purvis steps toward the doorway, and as he enters, Barton lingers in the hall. At a table, a stout man eats, and the baby-faced man nods. The woman steps away and returning, shows off her shoes and holds out the opened wallet as well. Purvis eyes it and gives a nod, then leaves, shutting the door. The woman looks wearily to the stout gentleman at the dining table. Now Purvis and Barton enter a stairwell, with Purvis hurrying downstairs and rushing from the building to run across the street to agent Baum. In the stairwell, Barton peers through a window in the door, squints, steps into the hallway, and lets the door swing shut behind him. From the stairwell, our gaze lingers on the door, then drifts over to a set of elevators. One of them opens, revealing a tall man with rugged features who steps off and heads for the door.",
    "813": "There's a stampede involving handbags, shoes, and gloves, all available for the taking, during which she puts down the tall pinkie boots that a woman grabs and snatches from her. Rebecca jumps on the woman, and later at home with her head slumped, she sits contemplating the mountain of shopping bags in front of her, including the Gucci boots. A message from Luke demanding the outline appears on her laptop, and she looks at her watch before slumping down at her desk. She idly pulls a coat from one of her bags, with her face folding as she reads the label. Rebecca looks at an empty photo frame on Luke's desk, while Luke regards her with a twinkle in his eye. Hayley brings Rebecca a note, and Luke picks up the phone. Hayley rushes back in as Rebecca, like a woman possessed, clambers onto the slippery boardroom table on all fours, propelling herself at the phone. Later in Luke's office, with Hayley present, Luke looks earnestly into Rebecca's face, glancing dubiously at Hayley, and Rebecca smiles meekly. She later opens a letter at her desk. At her home, Rebecca's smiling dad magics a coin from behind her ear and puts it into her outstretched hand before plunking himself down on an easy chair that tips back, causing Rebecca's expectant smile to freeze. A recreational vehicle crashes around the corner with Graham at the wheel, making Rebecca's face brighten. At the office, Wilson is looking at an Asian Web page while she wears a flirty, fishing-for-something kind of expression. Suze is trying on a frothy white tulle wedding dress as Suze's mom tries on her veil. Yawning with exhaustion, Luke steps into a lift to join Alette swathed in fur and leggy Alicia, before Alette sweeps out, and Alicia trips and falls into Luke's arms. In Miami, Florida, home to sun-kissed beaches and a marina full of private boats, Luke and Rebecca are at a magazine conference, after which Alicia goes off in a huff. Smiling women crowd around Rebecca, who grins across at Luke as his eyebrows shoot up with amusement, while a waitress hands her a cocktail, and Rebecca notices the man's name tag. A bony-faced, sandy-haired man appears, with whom she nose-nuzzles in Eskimo style before Luke leaves her to it, and she peers blankly at Janne. Luke oversees Janne waiting for an answer, leading her to slap Janne's face. Alicia, pouring champagne, misses the glass as she watches in horror, while Rebecca answers her mobile and glances around furtively on a breezy terrace, taking a deep, deep breath. She takes a man to a men's store where he slumps on a seat and shoots her a look, making her recoil. She then straightens his bow tie, helps him with a black tuxedo, and sits down to face him before he pulls her onto the dance floor, puts one arm around her waist, and clasps her right hand in his left hand.",
    "629": "Merrill stares wearily up the staircase, climbing the first two steps, and gazes in horror at the unsecured hatch door in the attic. Merrill and Graham pull the children down the hallway into the kitchen, and Morgan's terrified eyes focus on the gap at the bottom of the front door as green gray fingers appear underneath it. Graham hurries down some stairs into the gloomy basement and slams the door shut. He turns suddenly and presses his ear against the door, his hands pushing against it, with its olive green paint peeling. Graham looks down at the doorknob, grabs it as it starts to turn, and holds it tight with both hands, resting his head on the door. Merrill spots a pickaxe, and as he yanks it off a high shelf, he smashes the light bulb, plunging the basement into darkness. Morgan turns on a torch, stares down into its bright beam before looking around, and points it at the door. Graham and Merrill push hard against it, the pickaxe now firmly wedged under the doorknob, and Graham turns to put his back against the door, shielding his eyes from the bright torch beam. Morgan slowly directs the torch beam around the basement, starts to walk past a cluttered workbench, and the light falls on Bo, crouched on the floor, who waves lamely at Morgan. Merrill finds another flashlight and directs its beam around the walls of the basement, illuminating old wooden shelves supporting neatly-arranged pickling jars, bowls, ski boots, roller skates, and disordered clatter. He spots a dusty old radio on one shelf and tunes the dial on the front. They go around to face the door, and Graham pushes his hand against the door lit by Morgan's torch. He then turns to face the others, the pickaxe holds in place as the doors hit, and Graham stares thoughtfully at the door. Morgan sets the white-headed silver torch on the ground and rolls it across to his father. Merrill walks over to Graham, and Graham and Merrill move slowly in different directions, working their way around the rough stone walls, passing a dry and faded flowery hanging on a hook and a wire-framed basket hanging on another peg. They come towards each other again, their torch beams picking up the coal chute with a rolling turning grill across it and Morgan standing in front of it. Merrill and Graham stand and stare at him, stunned, as a clawed hand pokes through the grill and grabs Morgan's throat. Graham drops his torch as he rushes to rescue his son, and as he runs away from the coal chute, he kicks the torch which rolls around to pick out Bo's legs, poking out from beneath her silky blue dress as she presses herself up against the wall.",
    "1196": "Harry sees something swirling around inside the crystal ball, and as he moves closer and peers into the mist, he sees the face of Sirius Black. A hand claps him on the shoulder, and bemused, Professor Trelawney gazes at Harry. With a worried look on his face, he runs out of the room and hurries away down the circular staircase. Outside, in a ruined part of the castle, crows alight on the fallen masonry. Hermione, Harry, and Ron peer through a ruined archway at a man wearing a black hood, sharpening the curved blade of a huge axe. They leave the school, walk through the cloister and into the grounds, where Malfoy and his cronies are on the slope above Hagrid's cottage. Furious, Hermione threatens Malfoy, her wand at his throat, and he's terrified. As she turns away, Malfoy smirks, but she turns back and punches him full in the face. Malfoy and his cronies make a run for it, and she smiles at Ron. Ron, Harry, and Hermione run down the steep steps cut into the grassy slope towards Hagrid's cottage, finding him gazing sadly out of the window at Buckbeak, who is chained to a post in the pumpkin patch. A line of dead ferrets is hanging nearby, and he feeds a small creature, opens a small blue tin, and takes out Ron's rat. Another pebble hits Harry, and they look out of the window to see Fudge, Dumbledore, and the Executioner making their way towards the cottage. Hagrid ushers them out, and they peer out of the back door as, at the front door, Hagrid welcomes his guests. Harry, Ron, and Hermione escape from the cottage and run down the garden path, hiding behind a huge pile of giant orange pumpkins. A crow lands beside them as they anxiously watch the cottage. Hermione spins around and peers into the forest, and they run as fast as they can away from the cottage and up the grassy slope. Buckbeak watches them go, and Harry glances back at the hippogriff still chained to a post in the pumpkin patch, then follows his friends. Halfway up the hill, they stop and look back towards the cottage, seeing smoke rising from the stone chimney. Dumbledore, Fudge, and Hagrid come out of the cottage with the Executioner, who walks across the garden carrying his sharp axe over his shoulder. He moves through the pumpkin patch towards Buckbeak, and they watch horrified as the Executioner raises his axe and the huge blade swings down. Hermione hides her face on Ron's shoulder, putting her arms around his neck. Suddenly, Ron drops his rat, blood on his finger, and chases the rat, with Harry and Hermione following him. Ron catches Scabbers and slumps down near the Whomping Willow with its twisted trunk.",
    "34": "Strasser looks up from the book, and Rick reaches over to take the book from his hand. Rick looks up from the book and gets up, walking away toward the gambling room. A couple enters the front door—Victor Laszlo, the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman in a simple white gown, Miss Ilsa Lund. The headwaiter approaches them, and as he takes them to a table, they pass by the piano, where the woman looks at Sam. She is so beautiful that people turn to stare, and Sam, making a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they go past, though he steals a look in her direction afterward, appearing to know her. Berger, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a distance. The headwaiter seats Ilsa, and Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table. Laszlo sits opposite Ilsa and surveys the room while Berger walks up to their table. Carefully lifting something up, Berger holds it for their view, then sits down with them as Ilsa tries to warn him. Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away as Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa's manner is friendly yet reserved, her voice low and soft. Renault sits down, and Ilsa glances in Sam's direction. Suddenly, Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters, bowing and smiling pleasantly, but neither Ilsa nor Laszlo shows the slightest recognition. Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself, and Laszlo stands. Strasser looks sharply at Renault, only to see a noncommittal smile on his face, and then Renault and Strasser bow shortly. Ilsa smiles back at Strasser, although her eyes remain troubled. On the floor, Corina strums a guitar and starts her number, while Laszlo looks around with apparent casualness. He notices Strasser and Renault whispering together and sees Berger at the bar, so he rises and goes off. Ilsa's troubled profile is evident, and while Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction, which Ilsa notices. At the bar, Berger is sipping a drink as Laszlo walks up and casually takes a place next to him. Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it, and Berger shakes his head. Laszlo quietly absorbs the shock and stops when Sacha brings a drink to him. Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds enthusiastically as Ilsa sits alone at her table. Sam sits down, ready to play, and begins a number nervously, seemingly waiting for anything. He looks very uncomfortable and even more scared now. Of course he can. Ilsa starts to hum.",
    "803": "Bassam gets out and gives Ferris the finger as he walks down the track. Ferris also gets out and stands by a wall in the surveillance room, while Bassam continues along the track with Nizar. Ferris takes out his cell phone and looks at it, noticing something glinting in the sky, which is the Predator drone being flown to a higher altitude. Nizar gets in the front of the vehicle, and Ferris, sitting in the back, eats an orange. Nizar looks down anxiously, then looks away, opens his mouth, and gazes ahead thoughtfully. Nizar unzips his coat, takes out a computer disk, and offers it to Ferris, who then watches the disk on his laptop, revealing Al-Saleem on screen. Ferris makes a call on his cell phone to Hoffman, who is sitting on his yacht moored by a jetty near his large house, while Hoffman's wife comes out of the house. Ferris hangs up, puts on his shades, and walks down the track to join Bassam and Nizar, aiming his gun. Hoffman sits staring at a surveillance screen showing Ferris and Bassam, both using cell phones, watching Nizar ride along a busy street in a town on a moped. The guys shoot Nizar, who falls, and four men pick up the injured Nizar, carrying him to the back of the van. Ferris aims a pistol and shoots Nizar in the head before running away. The surveillance screen shows the scene from above, and Hoffman takes a call from Ferris, who is walking with Bassam. Bassam and Ferris drive along a dirt road, stop at the top of a hill, and Bassam reverses the vehicle a few feet. Ferris creeps up behind some rocks, takes out his binoculars, and looks down at a collection of stone houses, where a man stands by a fire burning CDs and cassettes. Ferris radios Bassam, who retrieves a rifle from the back of the four-by-four. Wearing traditional robes, a jacket, and a skull cap, Ferris walks down the hill towards the Iraqi by the fire, while Bassam gets down by some rocks, setting up the rifle's stand. The man at the fire sees Ferris and frowns as Ferris speaks Arabic and looks around. Bassam uses a telescopic sight to view Mehdi, a bearded man, as he walks out and then shoots him. Ferris kills the man by the fire, and when another man pops up from behind a wall, Bassam shoots him. A young man runs out of the house shooting, and Bassam drives down and makes a call. Ferris throws a grenade into a courtyard, runs in shooting, and exchanges fire with the young man. Meanwhile, two choppers fly towards the scene as the young man peers out from behind a wall.",
    "931": "The scene opens with a page of parchment featuring the Warner Brothers shield, followed by the text \"Warner Brothers Pictures, a Time Warner company.\" The page then turns to reveal a set of interlocking V's, indicating Village Roadshow Pictures. Another page turn reveals L shapes and a set of two broken squares with a small square in the center. A pocket watch on a chain lies on a desk beside typewritten sheets, on top of which is a magnifying glass. At the typewriter sits a man in his late 30s with dark hair and a neat mustache. A marquee in front of a cathedral erupts in flames as smoke billows out over bodies on the ground. A man in a frock coat carries a brown paper package under his right arm, and as he passes a woman in a wide-sleeved outfit, he transfers the package to her. The woman is Irene Adler, who is pretty, dark-haired, and wears a hat perched jauntily on her head. Sherlock Holmes, disguised as an Oriental man, lies on a mattress in the street smoking a pipe. He sits up, grabs handfuls of rice and coffee beans, and places them in a bag. Irene strides through the open market, where a man ahead of her tosses an apple. She walks down steps, stops, and twirls. Holmes walks up to her and takes her arm, swapping a loaf for the package. He pulls her aside, and she glances round at them before leading him by the hand into an alley. The swarthy man who was tossing the apples steps out in front of them. Irene takes the package back from Holmes, leaving him with the loaf. The swarthy man studies Holmes' shabby disguise and whistles. Holmes removes his spectacles as three men facing him close in, slapping the bread away and ripping off his fake, droopy mustache and ill-fitting wig. The swarthy man grabs Holmes by the neck and throws him against a fence. Holmes responds by kicking the man, punching him, and throwing rice in one of the thug's faces. He ducks as another throws a punch that instead hits his colleague. Holmes fights back, but is eventually pressed against the slatted wooden fence with chains wrapped around his wrists. As the leader closes in with a crate, Holmes spits coffee beans into his face and manages to duck beneath the crate swung at him, then kicks an attacker to the ground. The group steps back as they notice two uniformed policemen on the beat, and Holmes slumps to the ground. The swarthy man tosses coins at him, does a little skip, and starts to whistle again as the peelers walk away. Holmes remains crouched on the ground as if in a trance.",
    "1097": "Six silver interlocking V shapes of decreasing sizes are followed by a scene outside a large Catholic church, where a hearse and several cars are parked. Inside, a balding man plays the organ while a small congregation sits in pews towards the front of the grand church. An older man named Al rises from his seat, walks past a coffin draped in a white sheet, and approaches a tall, hard-faced elderly man standing beside it, Walt Kowalski. On a table in front of the coffin is a photograph of an attractive middle-aged woman. Al shakes Walt's hand and returns to his pew. Four casually-dressed teenagers—Daniel, David, Ashley, and Josh—walk up the aisle, each kneeling and making the sign of the cross. Ashley, a pretty girl with red hair wearing a short top that exposes her pierced belly button, causes Walt to grimace. Josh, a thin boy with fair hair, is last to kneel and make the sign of the cross. Walt watches the kids with narrowed eyes, his expression tight-lipped, as his middle-aged sons, Mitch and Steve, turn to each other. Walt stands motionless like a stone statue while Mitch gives Steve a withering look, and Mitch's wife, Karen, shushes them. Walt looks down wearily, his thin gray hair combed to one side, as a young priest in a flowing white surplice steps up to his lectern beside the altar. Ashley sits texting on her cell phone. Outside, the Stars and Stripes flies on a pole at Walt's modest clapboard house, where inside, mourners help themselves to food. In the basement, Daniel, David, and Josh open a trunk and look at some war photographs before Steve follows Walt, who wears a permanent frown, as Walt heads down to the basement. Steve, tubby and in his 40s, looks put out. Hearing Walt coming, the boys quickly shut the trunk and rush over to a couch to sit down, but Walt ignores them, picks up two metal folding chairs, and goes back upstairs. Holding her cell phone, Ashley looks at her mother, Karen, before approaching Walt, who's unfolding the chairs. After rolling her eyes and receiving a beckoning from Karen, Ashley trudges back to her seat. Walt exits out the front door with his Golden Labrador, opens a pouch of chewing tobacco as he descends the front steps, and watches people go into the neighboring house. He pops some tobacco in his mouth, stares at the house with narrowed eyes, spits, and wanders away. In the large garage, Ashley smokes beside a pristine Ford Gran Torino muscle car, its cover partially pulled back. Walt pulls open the garage door, allowing sunlight to flood in, as Ashley drops her cigarette and blows out smoke.",
    "1091": "At night in pouring rain with the collar of his jacket pulled up, Tuvia stands staring at a cottage in the clearing, his lips pursed. Inside, Berniski, his wife, and two sons who were with him at Koscik's house, are having dinner. They all look towards the door as Tuvia walks into the room. Berniski jumps up, and Tuvia draws the gun. Berniski shrugs lamely. Cowering, Berniski sinks to his knees. One son stands up. Tuvia dispatches both sons, then Berniski, and then Berniski dies. Tuvia looks at the woman without remorse as she mourns before him, her hands splattered with blood, and he goes, stumbling through the dark forest, making his escape. At dawn, Zus, sleeping in a makeshift tent, awakes with a start, a bottle of vodka by his legs. Groggily, he looks at the sleeping people all around him, picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet, then notices smoke from a small fire. Tuvia sits broodily staring into space, and Zus hands his brother the bottle. Tuvia takes a slug, and Zus examines the revolver, counting the number of bullets. A fleeting smile passes between them. Zus hands back the gun. Sharpening a spear, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp with more refugees. A pretty brunette walks by and gives Tuvia a long look. Later, two men are sawing a log, another lays branches onto the roof of a shelter, and Zus hammers a beam. Malbin, hammering a nail, drops the log he's holding, narrowly missing Zus. Malbin turns to Tuvia. Zus frowns at the girl with a beret. Lazar and Laila walk off, everyone looks around. Two young men enter the camp, one wielding a rifle. Zus puts his hands up. The brothers stiffen, and Zus eyes them steadily. Peretz meets his gaze and slowly shakes his head. Zus walks away, stumbling into the undergrowth. He throws up by a tree and sinks to his knees. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother convulsing with grief. Zus bangs his head against the tree trunk, and Tuvia grabs him from behind and wrestles him to the ground. Blood seeps from the wound on Zus’s head. He frees himself from his brother's grasp. The two newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, are talking to Asael. Tuvia runs off to Zus. Tuvia looks at Asael, who averts his gaze, and then back at Zus. A full moon gleams in the dark sky. Zus shoots the man. Zus shouts. An elderly Russian runs out to his blazing truck, and Zus dispatches him. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he tosses the old man's body into the burning bed of the truck. A pinprick of light punctures the darkness. Peretz, running along a dirt track, joins the others hiding in a ditch.",
    "828": "Cal hurries into the bar, clearly hypnotized by his move and his good looks, she forces herself to take a step back. He surveys it, studying the bar and various men and women chatting and flirting with one another. Wet from the rain, he steps further into the bar. In his bedroom, Jacob leans over Hannah, who lies back on the bed. He kisses her, kisses her again, and leans down to kiss her again. Still wearing his trousers, he lies between her open legs, then he pulls away from her and flops onto the bed. In the garage, Hannah sits in the massage chair, wrapped in a sheet. They lie on the bed laughing, and he smiles. Jacob licks his lips and nods. Jacob has fallen asleep with his glass in his hand. Hannah takes the glass, puts it on a chest of drawers, then pulls the sheet up over him. She gazes at him and smiles. She props herself up in bed, leans over, kisses him on the cheek, then lies back down resting her head on his shoulder, nuzzles into him, and closes her eyes. Cal's brow is knitted as he talks on the phone. Cal sits at the bar drinking on his own as the bartenders clean up. Cal looks over at a balding guy opposite him of a similar age, who sips his drink through a straw. The guy notices Cal eying him and raises his brows in acknowledgment. With a sad expression, Cal picks up his mobile. In a restaurant, Emily's phone rings, and she hangs up. Heading back to her house, David leans in and kisses her. The door opens, and they both nod awkwardly. David glances at Jessica and smiles, then heads off. Jessica has her arms folded and grins as Emily heads in. Jessica shrugs, shakes her head, and strides off. Emily goes in and shuts the door behind her, holding a clutch bag in one hand and a bunch of flowers in the other. She tosses the flowers on a chest of drawers in the hall, but she passes Robbie, who sits on the stairs watching her, without noticing it. Someone pedals furiously on a bike. At home, in her room, Jessica gets out a camera from her drawer, and he has the bunch of flowers with him. Studying her reflection in a mirror, she dons mascara. It's Robbie pedaling through the night. Jessica brushes out her long, dark hair and sweeps eyeshadow across her lids. She applies a peachy-colored lipstick to her lips, presses them together, then pouts in the mirror. She puts the camera on a shelf in her room. The light on it flashes as she stands a few feet away in her dressing gown.",
    "1056": "The curricle continues on its way, with Mr. Collins perched on the back. Now, he's standing in the parlor as Jane, Lizzie, and Mary enter. The three girls sit down. Jane and Lizzie rise from their seats. Lizzie and Jane have sat back down again, and Mr. Collins regards the three girls with condescension. The three sisters are now standing, watching him coldly. Having backed out of the parlor, he makes his way over to the curricle outside. With a sympathetic shake of the head, he climbs up into the carriage. Lizzie and Jane have come out to see him off. They wave him off. As soon as the coast is clear, Kitty peers out from behind a wall. She bustles over to the house. Lydia is sitting, looking out of a lead-paned window, humming happily to herself. She glances over at Wickham. Wickham smiles. At Longbourn, Jane runs up the stairs. She bursts into Mrs. Bennet's room. Jane wafts the vial under her mother's nose. Mr. Bennet arrives home in the pouring rain. Jane and Lizzie are waiting for him. He steps inside, takes off his top hat and black cloak, and heads into his study, closing the door behind him. Jane and Lizzie are watching him with some concern. The two sisters exchange worried glances. Mr. Darcy is wandering through a cobbled street, bustling with people and horses. He makes his way down the crowded street, looking slightly lost. When he reaches a corner, a young beggar girl stops him to ask for money. As he searches his pockets for coins, he asks her for directions. She indicates the road he should take. Finally, he finds the house he's looking for and bangs on the door. As the door opens, a woman looks shocked to see Darcy. Her housekeeper quickly tries to shut him out. The Bennet sisters are still sitting in the parlor. Jane puts down her book and is just going to pour the tea when Mr. Bennet comes in. All four girls look at him expectantly as he takes a seat. Kitty is sobbing. Seeing Kitty's distress, Mr. Bennet's face falls, and he leaves the room. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is back out, searching the darkened streets, clutching a piece of paper in his hand. He gazes up at a house. Lydia, meanwhile, is getting more and more bored by the minute. She gets up off the bed and wanders over to the window. Wickham's drinking wine. A young man is galloping along on horseback in the bright sunshine. The housekeeper peers out of the window at Longbourn, and seeing the messenger arriving, quickly hurries out to meet him. He pulls a letter out of his saddlebag, dismounts, and gives it to her in exchange for a few coins.",

Her sister ignores her, and leaving the door open, Charlotte sulks away. Now, Debbie steps out of a side door and opens a trash bin. She breaks up a pack of cigarettes and throws them away, overturns a small pouch into the bin, and goes back inside. Pete comes out the same door with a plate carrying three cupcakes. Setting it aside, he opens the trash bin and overturns a large jar of candy, then throws the cupcakes in one at a time. Pete pauses at the last cupcake and takes a deep breath, unwraps the cupcake, and takes a large bite. He starts to throw the rest in, hesitates and takes another bite, chewing blissfully, he holds the remainder over the trash. Pete leans in, devours the treat, and throws the last bite away. Now, he jogs on a treadmill with electrodes dotting his bare chest. In another exam room, a technician positions Debbie at a mammogram machine while a doctor stands close with his hand up Pete's hospital gown. In another office, now she sits in a dentist's chair. Now, Pete's doctor snaps on a latex glove as Pete leans over a table, and his doctor bends close from behind, thrusts his finger out of view, and works it around. Now, Debbie sits with her feet in stirrups as two women enter separately and the doctor winks. Now, at home, Debbie joins Pete in a sitting room. Trying the sitting room door, Charlotte finds it locked, and Debbie moves away. Now, a gray-haired man steps out of a modest house as Pete approaches while a plane passes overhead. They hug, and now they sit in a living room. Pete smiles tightly as his dad cuddles the little blonde boy, and two more boys arrive identical to the first. Pete follows him out back and sprays the boys with a hose. Pete sighs and follows his father back inside, swallowing hard as his eyes widen. With his lips apart, his dad drops his gaze then looks up, and Pete's dad follows his middle-aged wife to the backyard. Now, in an upscale restaurant, Debbie approaches the hostess and points to a balding man wearing a jacket and tie sitting alone, who browses a menu at a table for two. Debbie stares at him as she takes a deep breath and rolls her shoulders. Later, he takes a bite of food, raises an eyebrow, and she shakes her head with a sad smile, then lowers her gaze. He takes out his phone, steps away, leaving his phone on the table.",
    "655": "The balcony starts to collapse, prompting Peter's webs to pull two people away from falling masonry, while MJ is stranded on a swaying piece of the balcony. Peter runs through the crowd, pulling at his clothes to reveal the Spider-Man costume underneath them. A pillar crashes onto a police car, and the glider returns to the balcony where the Green Goblin holds a pumpkin bomb that incinerates the board members. Harry is struck by a piece of masonry and knocked out, as the Green Goblin glides up. Spider-Man swoops down, kicks the goblin from the glider, and the goblin lands on top of a marquee. The glider shoots into and out of a hot air balloon. A little boy stands rooted to the spot as the world unity festival hoarding falls towards him, but Spider-Man rescues him. Police converge on the Green Goblin, who easily punches them with his fist. Spider-Man swings in front of the Green Goblin and throws a punch, but the goblin catches his hand and kicks Spider-Man in the chest, driving him backwards until he stops against a lamp post, which crashes onto a passerby. The goblin leaps back onto the glider, now fitted with guns, and pursues the running Spider-Man, firing at him. A missile narrowly misses Spider-Man, who leaps onto a large inflatable. Hearing MJ's screams, Spider-Man jumps from inflatable to inflatable, using one shaped like a kangaroo as a trampoline. As he bounces towards the balcony, the Green Goblin on the glider grabs him from behind, crashes him against a stained glass window, and repeatedly smashes his head against it. Spider-Man elbows the goblin in the face and breaks free. The two fight until Spider-Man falls towards MJ. The goblin descends on the glider, but Spider-Man shoots a web into the goblin's face and cuts an electric car cell from the underside of the glider. As the goblin escapes, MJ falls from the balcony. Spider-Man dives after her as she plummets towards the ground, catching her in his arm. The web attached to the balcony holds just in time, and they spring back up in the air. Spider-Man swings MJ to safety above the crowd below, and they continue high above the streets of Manhattan as people watch. MJ wraps her arms tightly around Spider-Man, looking around in wonder and awe at the experience and with him. They swing past the twin spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral and land on the roof garden of Rockefeller Center, surprising a canoodling couple. Spider-Man prepares to leave, somersaults off the roof, and MJ rushes over to see him swinging back and forth over the streets.",
    "970": "David averts his gaze, his lips parted, then shifts his eyes and shrugs. Charlie glances away and eyes David, who presses his lips in a disappointed line. Our view then hovers above a stately, high-ceilinged reading room, where a center aisle separates dozens of large tables arranged perpendicularly to it. The mustached adjustment officer sits at one table with his hands folded, and as men quietly work at other tables around him, some writing in slim books of their own, he shifts his contemplative eyes, then rises and walks down the aisle. Next, rain falls on the sidewalk in front of a ragtag neighborhood bar; inside, David sits at the bar writing multiple iterations of Elise's phone number on a napkin. The mustached officer sits beside him, and David glances down, shifting his jaw and glaring indignantly at Harry, who glances skyward, then over his shoulder, and lays a ticket on the bar. As Harry stands, David takes the ticket, and Harry dons his newsboy cap and leaves. David stares contemplatively at the ticket. On a ferry, passengers ride inside a covered seating area, and a couple at the handrail gaze out at the city skyline. David finds Harry leaning against the railing at the boat's stern, gives a nod, and gazes at the city. David then heads down a crowded sidewalk and as he walks amid the flowing pedestrians, the screen fades to black. David lies on his back in bed and gazes out a window with a faraway look, sunlight bathing his face as he rests his hands on his stomach. Shifting his gaze to the clock on his bedside table, he reaches over and turns off the alarm, then drops his head back on the pillow, his chest heaving. Our view sweeps down the front of his towering apartment building as David exits, briefcase in hand, and starts down the sidewalk. In Madison Square Park, dead leaves litter the ground, and David makes his way across, then waits at his bus stop. An M6 pulls up and he climbs aboard, sliding his pass through the reader and pausing in the aisle, his hopeful eyes finding the empty pair of seats occupied three years earlier by Elise. He heads to them and sits as the bus pulls away from the curb. Outside, sunlight yawns across the side of a high-rise, and David gazes out his window at a passing scaffold creating a canopied sidewalk by a construction site. A short distance ahead, he notices a dark-haired woman striding down the sidewalk. As the bus cruises past, he sees that it's Elise; Elise turns down a street behind the bus as it pulls over, and David hurries off and races back up the sidewalk after her.",

CLOSEUP UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND reveals pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do. He opens the door of his father's office and enters. George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. He looks tired and worried. The goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time. George stands irresolute a moment, aware of a crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but more keenly aware of his personal crisis. George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father. He comes around in front of the desk. He pushes George toward the door. As George passes Potter's wheelchair, he pushes the old man's shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand. George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder. George and his father are at the door. Bailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter. George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand. Gower is talking on the telephone. George stands in the doorway. Gower hangs up the phone and turns to George. He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back room. Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands. Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces. George tries to protect himself as best he can. George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously. He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. Gower steps toward him. But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is crying too. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store, showing a suitcase.",
    "1324": "Michael slowly approaches Gabriel. Jeep gives it some gas, but the engine's not catching. A dark shape pounces onto the hood of the car. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a shopping mall Santa Claus, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head. Michael closes his eyes. Buzzing surrounds them. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward the source of the clicking. He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. It takes the creature a moment to realize that the clicking sound is coming from Bob's silver Zippo. Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter. Bob looks at Gabriel. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty Zippo. Gabriel's eyes go wide as the tiny flame dances in front of the stove's broken gas line. Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes. The massive explosion rocks the slow moving vehicle. Jeep swings the gun around. Blam! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down. Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting Audrey. Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off inside the car! Jeep ducks. The car swerves madly. The flare ricochets through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July! Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield - ping! - and nails him right in the face, setting. And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and fire. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to pull himself back in. Jeep pulls the trigger again and click. Brings it up to fire, but he's too fast! Whack! Gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand. Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again. Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Jeep punches it. The speedometer leaps ahead. Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie, his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and roll into a ball of fire. The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation.",
    "379": "As we circle behind them, we look down at Ashton, a tiny town in a tiny valley, where Karl smiles, but then it fades into a certain sad suspicion. Karl thinks for a moment, then they shake on it. In a single shot, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt. Spirits buoyed by the high school marching band, all the good citizens of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl, with a few tears amid the familiar faces. Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck, and the crowd cheers. With that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go, with only Don Price, smoking on the corner, not sad to see Edward leave. Many townsfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand. As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with an unnamed person. The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast, and she motions for Edward to lean down so she can whisper something to him. Although we're very close, we can't hear her voice, and the advice only succeeds in confusing Edward. We tilt up from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton, each wearing a backpack with all his earthly possessions. Edward and Karl come to a bend where the paved road veers left, and an overgrown dirt road runs straight, blocked with signs and warnings of danger. Karl looks at the dirt road, wary and a little paranoid, but perks up even though it means more for him to carry. The road is overgrown but not altogether creepy, with the sun still shining and the birds still chirping. The road narrows to a rough path, with spikes of sunlight breaking through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. Coming around a bend, his pitch drops as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path, and he stops, realizing for the first time that the birds have stopped singing, and the forest is dead quiet. He looks back the way he came, but Edward presses on, carefully stepping through the thorns. Just then, a cawing crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands. Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead into the spiderwebs. Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt, with one stuck in his sleeve, requiring him to dance to get it out. Even then, he keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind. At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.",
    "1219": "Volunteer James gives a sermon under a canopy with the aid of a translator while a man with a camcorder records the event. Another volunteer provides medical care as Sarah passes by and walks up wooden steps into a hut where young people sit in a waiting area, some with missing limbs. Inside, Sarah finds Michael with another patient lying on the floor and hands Michael a roll of bandage to bind a stump where the shin should be; the patient writhes in pain, and Michael gives him a comforting pat. Sarah looks down at them, then at the waiting patients where a very small boy has only one leg. Suddenly, the village is attacked with rocket fire as a rocket is primed, and Sarah hands a child to its mother. The rockets, fired by the army, blow a man to pieces as Michael roams with a child in his arms. Rockets hit the paddy field destroying a wooden hut, and Sarah cowers under a hut while the army enters the village with weapons blazing. A volunteer carrying a child in each arm is cut down, and the children are dragged from him, with one shot and the other bayoneted in the stomach while his face is held down by an army boot. A woman is shot, another abused, and a third dragged away by her hair. In slow motion, a volunteer in a baseball cap tries to outrun the rocket fire, but is hit, severing his legs below the knee. A man kneels before a pair of soldiers with weapons as soldiers hack off villagers' limbs. A soldier with a flamethrower sends a plume of flame into a building, causing villagers with clothing on fire to run from it and roll in the dust, while a small child is torn from its mother and tossed into the burning building. Sarah runs as Michael is rifle-butted and the villagers run across the paddy field. The truck with a machine gun on a tripod arrives, massacring the villagers in mid-flight. Sarah is accompanied by a mother and a child who run with her, but the mother is shot in the back and drops to the ground. From the truck, the cool commander watches the carnage while his subordinate blazes away. Partially caught by a blast, Sarah tumbles into the water of the field as the commander pulls on his cigarette. More villagers run towards the truck as their bodies are torn apart by bullets and gunfire picks off survivors. Sarah looks up just as two soldiers grab her by the arms; she tries to fight them off, but they haul her to her feet and drag her away by the scruff of her neck. In the truck, the soldier in charge of the machine gun pivots to and fro in search of victims.",
    "897": "He pushes Cahoon toward the door, and the hulking inmate follows close behind. Dillinger hides against a wall. Cahoon peaks through the bars. As the guard opens the door, Dillinger pushes Cahoon away and slams Brian into the wall. The hulking inmate covers Cahoon's mouth. Dillinger spins Brian to the next door, pointing the waxy weapon at his back. Brian refuses. Dillinger pokes Brian with the gun. He shoves Brian to his hulking accomplice, who still restrains Cahoon. Dillinger eyes the door. He kicks it open and hits the guard in the face. Max tumbles down a flight of stairs with Dillinger close behind. His accomplice holds a pipe in his raised hand as he pushes Brian behind Dillinger. Using Max's keys, Dillinger opens the next barred door then forces Max to stand in front of a metal door. The guard on the other side peeks through then unlocks it. As he opens the door, Dillinger shoves him into Max, and his accomplice hits Brian with his pipe. Dillinger rushes into the office and holds his gun to the warden's neck. He pushes the warden into the hall while his accomplice restrains a deputy. As Dillinger jams the barrel of his gun into the warden's neck, the warden spins the dial on a safe door. Dillinger steps into the closet-sized safe, discards his fake, waxy gun, and grabs a pistol from the wall. He steps out with a rifle and hands a machine gun to his accomplice. The warden glances back as the accomplice leads him away. Dillinger grabs a hat and coat from a nearby rack. He puts them on and tosses a jacket to the other inmate, who grabs a hat from the rack as he ushers the deputy out behind Dillinger. With his rifle raised, Dillinger cautiously opens a metal door in the hallway. His accomplice follows close behind with one hand clutching the deputy between them. They make their way into a garage where a mechanic works on a police car. Dillinger reaches into one of the cars and rips out its ignition wires. He strides to the Ford V8. Outside, four officers talk to each other on a porch, their guns perched casually against their shoulders. The sleek Ford passes undetected in the alley beside them. At the front of the jailhouse, the National Guardsmen mill about by their sandbag wall. As Dillinger drives through the town, he nervously shifts his eyes back under the tipped-down brim of his fedora. The jailhouse mechanic sits beside him while his accomplice rides in back with the deputy. Dillinger notices three National Guardsmen strolling down the sidewalk. He stops for a red traffic light on a corner where more National Guardsmen stand together talking, their guns strapped over their shoulders.",
    "318": "In the flickering firelight of the Noldorin forge in Eregion, molten gold pours from the lip of an iron ladle. Three rings, each set with a single gem, are received by the high elves—Galadriel, Gil-galad, and Cirdan. Seven rings are held aloft in triumph by the dwarf lords, and nine rings are clutched tightly by the kings of men, as if holding-close a precious secret. An ancient parchment map of Middle Earth shows Mordor as the camera moves slowly across it, seemingly drawn by an unseen force. Teasing shots reveal Sauron forging the One Ring in the chambers, with the fiery lava reflecting off the ring as fire writing emerges on the plain band of gold. The One Ring falls through space and into flames, as a great shadow falls across the map, closing in around the realm of Gondor, whose people flee their homes, pursued by armies of hideous orcs. Isildur, son of the King of Gondor, leads an army across the plains of Dagorlad, commanding rank after rank of elven archers. Orcs retreat before the army of the Last Alliance, as Elendil holds aloft the great sword Narsil. The huge, dark figure of Sauron, bearing the One Ring on his finger, looms over the field of battle and lays waste to the armies of the Last Alliance. With desperate courage, Elendil leads a charge, but the black mace of Sauron lashes out, and Elendil's body falls like a crumpled rag doll. Isildur cradles the body of his father in his arms as the shadow of Sauron falls over him. Isildur snatches up the broken blade of Narsil and severs Sauron's fingers, causing the One Ring to fly from his body and disappear. Isildur picks up the severed finger and removes the One Ring, transfixed. At Gladden Field, Isildur leads a small column of men through darkening woods, the One Ring glinting on a chain around his neck, until suddenly arrows fly in an ambush by orcs. Isildur materializes underwater as the Ring slips slowly from his finger. Ripples of light play across Isildur's pale face, and he is dead. The Ring falls through the murky waters of the river, and the waters of the Anduin River lie dark and undisturbed. Silt swirls as a thin white hand reaches down, grasping the Ring, and opens to reveal one ring. Bathed in cold moonlight, the world lies dark and still in an unsettled quiet before the storm. In the gloom of a mountain cavern, a murky pool of water sits in the darkness, and the shadowy outline of an emaciated figure is seen. Unseen by its keeper, the Ring falls to the muddy floor of a mountain tunnel, where a small hand, fumbling in the dark, closes over it. A youngish-looking Bilbo Baggins peers down at what lies in his hand, perplexed by what he has found. Frightened, Bilbo quickly pockets the One Ring and hurries on.",
    "52": "Reggie is on the phone, followed by Dyle also being on the phone. She opens the door of the cabin and starts out, stepping out of her cabin and looking into the others. All the cabins are occupied except one, which she looks inside, noticing the receiver hanging by its cord, swinging back and forth, leaving her confused. Meanwhile, Dyle and Scobie stand together waiting for the elevator, with Scobie clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat. The self-service elevator doors open, one or two passengers come out, and Dyle and Scobie enter, followed by a young girl who starts in after them. Scobie reaches out with his metal hand and presses the top button, and the doors close. As Scobie follows Dyle out of the elevator, Scobie looks around and notices an open door at the end of a short hall. He and Dyle approach it, with the camera following, and through the door, which Scobie closes behind them, is a flight of stairs leading up to a second floor. Dyle yawns wide, then gets to his feet, and starts up the stairs, followed by Scobie. Dyle stops at the door, opens it, and the stairs continue up to a spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. Dyle and Scobie come out onto a level portion of the roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows. Dyle turns and looks, seeing nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street, and moving quickly, he lashes out and hacks Scobie's gun hand with the side of his palm, causing the gun to fall to the roof. Dyle follows through by punching the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling, Scobie wraps his arm around Dyle, holding on tightly until his head clears. To Dyle's amazement, he is lifted into the air, unable to break the bear-hold, and is carried toward the edge of the roof. Dyle works his arms between their two bodies and suddenly flails them out with all his strength, breaking the hold, but at the cost of his coat and the flesh on his back as Scobie's metal claw rips through both, leaving a wound extending from the center of Dyle's back to his shoulder. Both men look around for the gun, spotting it simultaneously and leaping for it, both landing short of the mark. They grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun. Two hands, one real and one metal, inch toward the gun as the battle goes in Scobie's favor, whose weight and strength begin to tire Dyle, now on his back, trying to stop Scobie from crawling over him.",
    "832": "The guys consider for a moment as Nick stares down, brow creased, before taking the briefcase. Nick is at work when Harken harangues an employee within earshot of him. Nick takes a pen and slides it down his throat, causing himself to vomit into his wastepaper basket. After wiping his mouth, Nick picks up the plastic bin and heads out. The guys drive down a leafy, suburban street and gaze over at a large house as Kurt grins. Night falls, and chewing on snacks, they all share a look. They get out of the car and quickly hide as Bobby's garage door swings open. An orange Pontiac Trans Am tears out and drives off down the street. Nick and Kurt roll under the slowly closing garage door, with Dale bashing into it, causing the door to open again. Inside the house, they see tasteless artifacts and a deep tray of cocaine about the size of a CD case, which he drops, resulting in a cocaine cloud hanging in the air. Kurt enters the bedroom where there's a large Japanese style portrait of Bobby brandishing nunchucks and pockets something from the dresser. Nick, wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt, watches Dale pick up the tray, while Kurt uses his sleeve gloves to turn the light on in Bobby's on-suite bathroom and spots Bobby's toothbrush. Kurt takes the toothbrush from its holder, slides it down his ass crack, and has a good scrub before putting it back. Dale's hoody is dusted with cocaine, and he tries to sweep it off while Kurt picks up Bobby's razor and pops it down the back of his trousers. In the open plan living space, Nick dumps the contents of a Dustbuster vacuum into the cocaine tray, now full of dust, cocaine, and debris, remaining stony-faced. Kurt finds dental floss as Dale sniffs and flexes his jaw. Kurt finishes up in the bathroom, turns the light off, and leaves for the living room, where he slaps Dale, and Dale rolls his shoulders. Street lamps illuminate the darkened street as they drive on and pull up outside Harken's palatial home to park in the shadows. Approaching the front door, they climb over a low hedge and peer in through the windows when something catches Nick's eye. He takes a rock from a plant pot by the door, tosses it to Kurt, and takes a key from the rock. They enter the spacious hallway where a portrait of Harken with his wife and their cat hangs in the lounge. The cat leaps onto Nick's shoulder and bolts as Dale sings along to the radio in the car. Kurt and Nick start across the landing, where life-size cat figurines rest on small podiums, and a porcelain cat's face hangs on the wall.",
    "230": "Bogucki gently knocks on the door and enters with some clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed, and holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself. In the next scene, the ceramic stove is visible as Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into strips, are being stuffed into it and burned by Janina. Szpilman, now wearing Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn while spooning hot soup into his mouth, as Janina adds the last strip of clothing. Later, a rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the dark streets and halts outside a store. As soon as it stops, the store's shutters are raised, and Bogucki escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the rickshaw, which moves off fast. GEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him inside, and pulls down the shutter. Gebczynski's store is stocked with sanitary furnishings and supplies, including lavatories, basins, baths, and taps. He leads the way, picking up a cushion and blanket as he goes, and Szpilman follows him down dark, shadowy stairs lined with shelves of taps, washers, and pipes. Gebczynski guides Szpilman to a specific set of shelves, puts aside the cushion and blanket, and starts to push at the shelves, which slowly move to reveal a secret compartment. He helps Szpilman into the compartment, hands him the cushion and blanket, and then pushes the shelves back into place, hiding Szpilman. In the cramped space, Szpilman cannot quite stretch fully and, with difficulty, places the cushion behind his head and starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops when he sees something. Later, Szpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at a tram stop as a tram approaches and halts. They board the tram apprehensively, pushing through the rear section packed with Poles until they reach a chain and sign separating the sections. In the German section, only three or four passengers, some read newspapers while others look out the windows, consciously avoiding eye contact with the Poles. Szpilman tries to remain inconspicuous as the tram continues on its way. Eventually, Gebczynski and Szpilman go up the stairs to a landing and door, which Gebczynski unlocks, allowing them to enter. Inside is a charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan. Gebczynski leads the way in, while Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, and looks out to see a section of the ghetto wall below, with a narrow street inside the ghetto leading to deserted buildings.",
    "299": "The CAMERA PULLS BACK into Jeff's apartment until his head fills the screen. He is asleep. A shadow of some other person creeps over his face. His eyes start to open. He looks up. The screen is filled with the eyes, nose, and mouth of a woman coming nearer and nearer to the CAMERA to kiss Jeff. The face is more or less in shadow, with a faint light coming onto the profile from the window. The girl kisses Jeff firmly, but not passionately. Then her head moves back an inch or two. She speaks. The two big profiles fill the screen. It moves down until the lips move out of the bottom of the screen, leaving just the eyes filling it. The CAMERA FOLLOWS HER quickly to another lamp. She gets a little farther away from us so that we now see her down to her waist. She turns on the second lamp, and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face. The CAMERA PANS HER over to a third lamp which she turns on. She is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless. Her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear. Jeff looks across the room at her. She does a professional model's turn in the dress, showing off its features. Jeff replies. She laughs pleasantly. She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her, which is littered with a number of his personal effects. Her own handbag is also on the table. As she talks, her eyes scan the table as if she's looking for something specific. Lisa finds what she has been looking for, picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, and examines it as she talks. She turns to look at him and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box. Lisa faces Jeff in the chair. She turns around quickly and dashes to the door, dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes, THE CAMERA PANNING with her. She goes up the two steps, stops, and turns back to Jeff. She reaches for the doorknob and turns it. She swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in the doorway is a middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar. His reaction is one of tender amusement. He smiles, nods, and enters. He's carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin. He goes down the stairs as she follows. He hands her the wine bucket, and she places it on the table. THE CAMERA GOES with both of them as he moves toward the kitchen and she moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet.",
    "851": "They deflect off Gabriel's steel breastplate. Gabriel rises into the air and swings his mace, crashing it into furniture. Michael wallops. Gabriel leaps over his wing and gets swept with a machine pistol. Gabriel shoves the spike in the middle of his mace into the barrel of the gun. Michael shoots and is blown back against the wall. Gabriel attacks. Gabriel slams the mace against the wall. Michael clutches the shaft of the mace. Gabriel sets the spiked end spinning. He pushes it towards Michael's face. Michael shoves it away, and Gabriel punches him. Michael punches Gabriel, grabs the overhead TV, and hurls it at Gabriel. Gabriel punches Michael to the floor. Gabriel grabs Michael by the throat, lifts him up, and punches him. Michael wallops him back and twists his arm. He flings Gabriel over and kicks him in the face. Gabriel forces Michael over a worktop and pins him down. He wields a hammer. Michael dodges the blow. Gabriel spins and slashes Michael across the chest. Michael looks down at his ripped shirt. Gabriel punches him in the face. Gabriel lunges with the mace, but Michael blocks the blow. The mace flies out of Gabriel's hands. Michael punches and kicks Gabriel. He gets on Gabriel's back, with his arms around his neck. Gabriel flies upwards and batters Michael against the ceiling. Michael keeps his arms held tight around Gabriel's neck. Michael holds on tight. Gabriel reaches down and picks up the mace. Gabriel holds the mace to his side and twists it. A blade shoots out, stabbing Michael behind him. Michael flops back onto the floor, his mouth wide open. Michael lies with his arms outstretched, eyes wide open, twitching slightly, a bloody wound in his chest. Gabriel turns and stares down at Michael. Tears glisten in Gabriel's eyes. Michael's bloody lips twitch. His eyes close as he expires. A golden light spreads over him. A tear runs down Gabriel's cheek as he watches. The bright light engulfs Michael, then vanishes taking him with it. Gabriel turns to go. As Jeep drives through the light, Charlie turns and looks at him. Black lines and symbols spread up his arm. Gabriel slowly steps through the wrecked diner holding his mace. He goes behind the counter where Bob is laying amongst the wreckage. Bob holds his lighter out to a gas tap at the base of an oven. He looks up at Gabriel. He sparks up a flame, igniting the gas. Gabriel takes flight as flames engulf the diner and the possessed outside. Jeep drives along a desert highway. Charlie sits on the passenger seat, cradling her baby and smiling down at him. Jeep frowns at Charlie. Then they both look ahead.",
    "595": "Holding a small tin and a pair of scissors, he attempts to cut a piece of plant as it waves its vine-like tentacles. Harry walks past and spots him, then approaches and gives Slughorn a fright, after which he walks away. Slughorn glances around furtively as Harry walks up a grassy hillock, with Slughorn lagging a little way behind. Ahead, he sees Hagrid, his dog, and Harry by the corpse of a colossal spider, and Harry demonstrates with his fingers. A bit of spider breaks off, and Slughorn drops it on the ground, then looks up at the giant Hagrid, bows his head, and closes his eyes. In Hagrid's cottage, Harry applauds the tipsy duo, with Hagrid's eyes closed and his head tilting back until it thuds against the high-backed chair, while Harry grins. Slughorn looks across the room at Harry, but his smile fades as Harry gulps and stares at the old man with the scar on his forehead. He stands up, and wide-eyed, Slughorn gazes at the boy standing before him, blinks, and his eyes moisten. Slughorn presses the tip of his wand against his temple, closes his eyes, then pulls the wand away, revealing a wisp of vapor, the memory. His hand shaking, he holds up a small test tube; as he inverts the wand, Harry steadies Slughorn's hand, and the memory drops into the container. In his study, Dumbledore pours it into the pensive, and the memory begins with the hourglass. The teenage Tom Riddle turns away from Slughorn and walks towards the fire, hands behind his back, fiddles with a ring on his finger, and then turns to face Slughorn, who looks into the boy's cold eyes. The memory ends, and Dumbledore holds up a hand to silence Harry. Looking troubled, the professor walks away from the pensive, crosses his study, and sinks down onto a short flight of steps. Dumbledore hurries to his desk, holds it up, and Harry touches the ring, which spins. Images of the teenage Tom, the boy in the orphanage, the pebbles on the window ledge, the postcard of the coast, and Voldemort flash by, and then the ring stops spinning. Harry flexes his neck as Dumbledore moves around the desk and looks closely at him, while Harry breathes deeply. Snape abruptly leaves the astronomy tower, and descending the stairs, he meets Harry, who has overheard his exchange with Dumbledore. Snape stops in front of Harry for a moment, then continues his descent. Harry climbs up to the upper platform, rubs his chin self-consciously, and they walk to the balustrade. Harry nods, hesitates, and places his hand on Dumbledore's arm, and they shoot off the tower as white-tipped waves roll towards a pinnacle rising out of the sea, where Harry and Dumbledore stand on top of it.",
    "610": "Over an adjacent street to the sound of gunshots, the taxi drops him and his luggage up the street with shops with graffiti'd shutters, where he stares up at a rundown tenement building and then lowers his eyes to see a grimy kebab shop by the name of Kebab Palace. Mrs. Kowalski leads Sydney into his grotty studio apartment, where inside, she slaps him and leaves with her nose in the air. Tiles on the dance floor light up as he struts from one disinterested group of girls to another, waving his hands, moving his pelvis, wiggling his backside, and leaping about, until the girls retreat from him wildly and stop. He puffs out his cheek and walks off as the dance floor lights up again. On the street outside, Sydney passes a leggy blonde in a green, and he glances over his shoulder to see her enter a bar with a red wood-paneled exterior. Turning on his heel, he hastily follows her inside, and as the blonde heads for the bar, Sydney enters and adjusts his jacket before confidently sidling up beside her. Affecting a suave smile, he takes his seat facing her and leans on the bar, but he gags on his drink and turns back to the leggy blonde before turning his back on a second woman with pretty, flaxen hair. The blonde leaves, and Sydney takes out the newspaper clipping as he spills her drink, soaking her notebook, and as the woman puts her phone away, she gathers her belongings and glares at him with a furrowed brow. Bobbie, a buxom brunette in a zebra print dress, takes Alison's seat, and Sydney nods with raised eyebrows. Back at Sydney's sparse, undecorated apartment, Bobby staggers off into the bedroom like a schoolboy, while Sydney takes a record, flings it over his head, and then replaces it. Sydney thrashes out power cords on it and flails wildly until the record suddenly stops, and he turns at the stop to see Bobbie's naked and points as Mrs. Kowalski slaps him. They turn to look at Bobbie, and their eyebrows shoot up in unison. Sidney wakes at 7:00 AM to the sound of his alarm clock, grimacing as he fumbles around and turns it off. Sunlight streams in through a bedside window as he yanks the cord of his venetian blind, which clatters down on top of him, and he tumbles from the bed. He spits in the sink and sips urine-colored water from a glass, only to spit it out over the mirror. In a gray tee-shirt and boxer shorts, he raises a blind in the living room, while half asleep under a blanket, Bobbie adjusts his genitals. Sydney strolls through Times Square in a tee-shirt, where garish billboards compete with towering glass-walled office blocks, with a tower with glass-walled offices reaching high in the sky.",
    "988": "Daisy crawls into the makeshift den, and Benjamin follows on his hands and knees. Kneeling beneath the table, Benjamin strikes a match and carefully lights a candle, whose warm glow silhouettes them behind the white drapery. Daisy smiles. She gingerly reaches out to touch his smiling face. Benjamin holds her gaze as she touches his stubbly cheek. Miss Fuller whisks up the sheet, exposing them. Daisy obeys. Miss Fuller scowls at Benjamin. Wearing a nightgown, she starts up the stairs, using her cane. Dejected, Benjamin leans out of the den with his head hung. Queenie comes up from the basement in her dressing gown and catches sight of him kneeling in the shadows, staring at the floor. Suddenly resolute, Benjamin rises, resting on his cane. She embraces him. She gently strokes his back and kisses him on the forehead. She scratches her head thoughtfully as he walks away. Benjamin hooks his cane on the end of his bed and gets in.

Lying in his bed, Daws exhales a cloud of wispy, white cigarette smoke and stares off in thought. Benjamin turns onto his side and sinks down beneath the covers. Smiling, Oti takes a step back, then turns and walks briskly out of the door. Straight-backed and without the use of a cane, Benjamin goes to a window and peers out through narrowed eyes. Carrying a suitcase, Oti crosses the road below, bathed in the orange glow of a streetlamp. A woman with a dog sits beside Benjamin at a piano. He joins in, and they play together. Benjamin washes himself in the bath. He stares down. Caroline leaves Daisy's bedside. On TV, Hurricane Katrina is shown. A nurse arrives. They stand by a window at the foot of the bed. The nurse strides off to assist a colleague, and Caroline drifts over to the empty bed beside her mother's. Cast in cold, blue light from the window, she takes her hands out of the pockets of her dark body-warmer and sits cross-legged on the mattress with the diary in her lap. Mr. Daws sits beside him on a bench. Grainy footage shows lightning striking Mr. Daws in a field, sending up a plume of smoke. A man approaches them on the dock. The captain glances around. Benjamin looks at a young guy. Benjamin stands up. The bearded captain wears braces and a peaked cap. He nods. Benjamin boards the tugboat Chelsea. The captain leans out of the wheelhouse. He swabs the decks. In the wheelhouse, Mike leans towards Benjamin. Mike squints thoughtfully. Benjamin wears a searching expression.",
    "1211": "They head into the forest, and BN now leads the escapees as they mount a rise. Lewis treads on a hidden land mine, and Diaz clamps a hand over his mouth as more troops dismount from the back of the lorry. The lorry moves on. Louis is wide-eyed in shock as Diaz whispers to him while Reese looks about. Michael cuts at the bloody wound, and Louis bites on a cloth. Soldiers get off a lorry with the tracker dogs, which are set after the scent and they lead their handlers in a rapid pursuit, followed by a large body of their colleagues. Rambo, Sarah, and School Boy run up a rocky slope, but Sarah stumbles in the dirt, prompting Rambo to run back to help her up while School Boy moves up front. Michael and the mercenaries carry Lewis on a hastily-constructed stretcher, and the dogs lead their handlers. On the rocky path, School Boy stops to listen in a craggy crevice as Rambo starts to tear a strip from Sarah's shirt, which he ties around his boot. School Boy tosses Rambo an explosive while Lewis' party looks around in horror. The commander's truck stops, and via a walkie-talkie, the commander screams orders at an armed patrol boat on the river. The grey patrol boat flies the Burmese flag, and the captain signals to his helmsman, who fires up the engine. A handler offers a tracker dog a sniff of clothing. Rambo runs through the undergrowth with a strip of Sarah's clothing on his boot, and the troops seem to be gaining on him as he runs through a carpet of dry brown leaves. A lorry pulls into a clearing and more troops dismount. Rambo heads through the forest at full tilt, skidding to a halt beside a gnarled tree where he takes the claymore explosive and launches it in the limbs of the roots. He glances in the direction of his pursuers and rips the clothing strip from his boot. He pulls a round metal disc, which is fastened to the body of the mine by a piece of twine that he ties around the cloth, and with another glance in the direction of the dogs, he pulls a priming pin from the bomb and covers the explosive with leaves before taking off into the forest. The dogs and their handlers halt by the bush, and a small dog with beady eyes, tan fur, and a white beard sniffs around leaves and ferns, causing the handlers to look at each other. One of the soldiers looks along the tree, where the rusty grey shape of the Tall Boy Missile is lodged in the ground and leaning against the branch, prompting the wide-eyed and terrified handlers to quickly pull the excited dogs away as a soldier kneels to inspect the ground.",
    "147": "Gandhi struggles to turn, and Mirabehn helps him. When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them. She looks at him nervously, then pours a glass from the pitcher. She turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip. Gandhi swallows with difficulty. He pauses, letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again. He tries to smile. Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability. Gandhi signals her down to him. She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear. We intercut their faces, very close, as he speaks. During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion. She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught. Her point of view. The doorway. Nehru stands in it. Kallenbach and Desai are a step or two behind him. It is a victory. Gandhi's face cracks into a tearful grin. And Nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time. He buries his head on Gandhi's hand, clutching it to him. Bright sunshine. A little boy is pulling a goat by a tether. He turns with a bright smile. Gandhi is walking, holding Ba's shoulder for support with one hand, and Mirabehn's with the other. Nehru stares at him and the policemen with growing incredulity. It stops Nehru. He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn. He laughs and Nehru struggles to join in the joke. A quiet hum in a packed courtroom. Armed sepoys line the wall. Featuring Judge Broomfield and the clerk. The Judge is flipping through documents on the case, a troubled frown on his face. At last, he shuts the folder and nods to the clerk. The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice. The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench. The courtroom immediately falls silent. The sergeant-at-arms opens the door -- a moment -- and Gandhi enters slowly. He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly. As Gandhi enters, he lowers his glasses, places them on his desk, and rises, facing Gandhi. Featuring two English court reporters. One nudges the other in astonishment, signaling off toward the judge. The clerk, confused as well as astonished, sees the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands. A disbelieving exchange of glances, the sound of others standing around them. The whole court rises, the astounded reporters the last of all.",
    "814": "He steps forward, and she grasps his shoulder, tossing back her long, straightened hair before stepping back as he steps forward. Her high-heeled, sandaled feet fall in with his dance step, and holding both her hands in his, he twirls her towards him, twisting her arms across her waist. Keeping their heads still, they move around in a circle, and she unravels from his hold, whacking his cheek with her fan and slapping his face with her long, tossing hair. They resume their initial position, holding waist and shoulder, and whirl altogether. She leans back seductively and flicks the fan, and Luke looks both startled and pleased as she flutters her eyelashes at him from behind the fan. He spins her again, and breaking from his hold, she dances an improvised solo, waving the fan in front of her chest, waist, and bottom. Luke smiles awkwardly and claps his hands vaguely to accompany his unpredictable dancing partner. Suddenly, she disappears, only to reappear behind him, swaying wildly from side to side, waving the fan in front of her. He tries to reconnect, but she whacks him again, then settles back in his arms. Later, they walk back to their hotel, where Alicia, sipping champagne on a sofa in the lobby, uncrosses her legs and struts towards him. She strokes and kisses his cheek, while Rebecca turns away, trying to mask her disappointment. In New York, Rebecca sits glumly in the back of a Yellow Cab as it crosses Times Square. Her chin resting on one blue cashmere-gloved hand, she answers her mobile and then dives to the floor of the cab, finding her black and white dress. Suze is propelled across the room and buried under an avalanche of clothes as Tall D. Freak smiles at his neighbor. Rebecca, wearing her sample blue gloves, faces the group. At home, Rebecca runs to the fridge and frantically searches through the freezer, bringing out a huge block of ice with a credit card in the middle. She smashes the block onto the counter and the floor, banging at it with a yellow stiletto heel and then a thicker wooden heel. She holds the smaller block to the floor and wrestles with it, using two hair dryers to melt it down, and eureka! Armed with the card, she goes to the store and spots a cute melon-shaped bag. It's the group leader, and Rebecca waves at Lainley, as the group leader clutches a shoe to her forehead. On the night of the ball, Luke, Alicia, and Rebecca ride up in the lift, with Rebecca in a beaded black and silver jacket. Alicia glances down at her and smiles as the lift doors open onto a sumptuous ballroom.",
    "372": "It's late, and Edward is pensive as the first raindrops hit the windshield, prompting him to turn on the wipers. Suddenly, a deluge descends, and it's like being caught in a waterfall, the rain is that loud. He puts on the handbrake, and just as suddenly, the sound changes from pounding to softly splashing as the world becomes close and echoing with the car underwater. The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is now water, and three catfish swim in front of his headlights. Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm as water trickles in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine. That's when he sees her, The Girl in the River, swimming outside the car. While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her. She puts her hand to the windshield, and he puts his up to meet hers and smiles. It's morning, and the sun shines brightly with birds chirping and trees dripping, the grass shining, still wet from last night's rain. The car balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. He pulls out a key and rubs it off; it's the Key to the City he lost years ago. Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance, passing a rusty sign. Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road with no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's. We look around the town, on and off Main Street, and slowly move through a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching. Two very corporate men in suits stick out among the bidders as Edward pitches his plan to Norther. In various shots, Edward is expressive and passionate as always, talking to Ping, Jing, and Amos Calloway. Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped. Although the sun is shining, it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy. In the distance, he sees a shack so old it's nearly fallen, and he walks toward it, the marshy ground squishing up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers. Edward knocks on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself, revealing an inside nicer than you'd think, a real home. With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano, and without turning, she speaks and keeps playing. Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished, and turns to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her, and hearing it put that way is strange to him. He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.",
    "321": "The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears as Gimli suddenly stands, excited, and rushes forward, swinging his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack, and Gimli falls backward, staring in disbelief at the ring, unharmed. Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him, making him slump in his chair, clutching his forehead, while Gandalf looks at him with concern. Stunned silence follows, and the council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice, and Gimli leaps to his feet. Frodo, motionless, experiences angry faces, shaking fists, accusatory fingers, and his eyes move across to the ring, as the hum grows louder in his head. The screen fills with an image of the Ring, streams of blood flowing across its surface, and flames flicker within the Gold Band. Frodo, breathing rapidly and caught in the grip of his hideous vision, with a huge effort or will, tears his gaze upon the ring and suddenly stands, speaking in a strong, clear voice. A sudden silence occurs as Frodo looks around at the astounded faces. Boromir looks at everyone, then walks towards Frodo, and looks towards Elrond and Gandalf. Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle-earth stand at his side. Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush as an old sword slides out of a shabby leather scabbard, its polished, well-tended blade glittering cold and bright. Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo and unwraps a small shirt of close woven mail. Frodo peels off his shirt, revealing The Ring on the chain around his neck when suddenly a shadow passes across Bilbo, and for a split second, he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and bony, groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked, and the shadow passes. Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands, faltering, his eyes filling with tears as he sobs, and Frodo moves to comfort him. The Fellowship climbs the long steep path out of the cloven vale of Rivendell, and they trek through a land of deep valleys and turbulent waters, with the Misty Mountains rising sharply to their left. Sam is at the campfire as Gimli manages to corner Gandalf. Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand, who then throws down his sword, kicks, and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground, followed by much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant dark patch that darts about the sky like flying smoke in the wind, while Gandalf looks at Aragorn and turns to the others, gesturing towards a high mountain pass. The Fellowship clamber through rock and snow as Frodo slips on some shale and the Ring falls on the ground. The ring gleams in the snow as Boromir's hand picks it up by the chain, and he stands with the ring dangling before his eyes.",
    "108": "Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens as some Alabama policemen and citizens clap their hands while National Guardsmen stand at attention with their weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd, noticing two black students being led toward the schoolhouse. The young black girl drops one of her books, and Forrest steps past the policeman to pick up the book from the ground. He steps out from the crowd and brings the book up to the girl. A coach looks at the television, where Forrest is seen standing at the schoolhouse door. He looks around and waves as an assistant coach looks at the television and then at the other coaches. The football coach and two assistant coaches look as Forrest dries himself off with a towel after stepping from the showers. In color footage, Governor Wallace is mingling in a crowd when gunshots are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter as Wallace lies wounded on the ground. Forrest sits on a bench as a black woman looks at him, with a white woman and a baby sitting to the left. A bus pulls up to the bus stop, and the black woman looks at her watch, then gets up and steps over to the bus. The white woman sits closer to Forrest. Later, Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain holding a box of chocolates, looking at a car that pulls up as a song plays on the radio. Inside the car, Jenny is with a boy, leaning back against the passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable. Billy gets back in the car and pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest. Forrest holds out the box of chocolates, and Jenny grabs his hand, leading him toward the dorm. They sneak to Jenny's door, unlock it, and step inside. Jenny pulls a robe off her sleeping roommate's bed and hands it to Forrest, who sits on Jenny's bed. She picks up a towel and walks back toward Forrest, drying the water from her hair. She takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to Forrest, wearing only her bra and panties. Forrest looks at Jenny as if he's never seen a woman in her underwear before and looks down at her breasts. Jenny realizes he is looking at her, leans over, and puts her head on his shoulder as a song comes over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest, laughs, and kisses him on the cheek. They hug on the bed, while Jenny's roommate pretends to be asleep but listens, horrified, with her eyes open.",
    "817": "She slumps down and gazes miserably at a photograph of herself and black-haired Suze laughing together. In his office, Luke picks up the empty photo frame from his desk and looks at it with a sigh, adding it to the other personal things he's put in a cardboard box. Alicia appears at his door. Graham brings Alette a cup. Jane can't do tiny, and all eyes are on her as she cuts a millimeter slice. Alette's perfectly made-up eyes blink, and she gives a Gallic shrug. Luke is in a bank. At the shopaholic meeting, the door bursts open, and group members put up their hands. At Dantay-West, Allon, the receptionist, gets an email about a sale and auction by the girl in the green scarf. At her desk, Haley looks at her inbox, and her eyes widen as she's holding a piece of paper behind her back. Luke leans over and snatches it from her; it's the attachment Allon forwarded to all employees. He keeps the ad and looks at it with a sober expression while the shopaholics group are getting the auction items ready. With crazed eyes, Haley jumps out of a cab and dashes to join a queue of women standing outside the church building where the sale is taking place. Graham is on door duty, Allon is first in line, and Graham demonstrates a red ensemble. D. Freak is on hats, and Miss Korch produces the green scarf. Haley sends a text. Rebecca suddenly seems hesitant; she grabs back the scarf, walks towards the blonde purchaser, and places it in her outstretched hands, looking at her intriguingly. Jane and Graham look on proudly as the blonde, smiling coyly, waves the scarf at the applauding women. Rebecca looks distraught. Later, Graham counts the takings. Derek Smeath strides into his office, and the staff watches him pass with po-faced curiosity. He looks back at them through his old-fashioned, black-rimmed specs, and his pace slows. An employee, seeing him draw near, ducks into an unseen office. Smeath, scowling, wipes his mouth and turns to the door of his own office, where Rebecca is at his desk, and all the money is in jars of coins. It's the day of the wedding, and a photographer on the decorated front steps of the church snaps the maids of honor arranging Suze's wedding train. One of them wears blue, the other pale green, and the third is in red. A figure in pink hurries up as Suze turns around and looks coldly at Rebecca, who, wearing a pink tulle veil, looks imploringly at Suze. She turns towards the street, where the bag lady, standing with her trolley, twirls around in Rebecca's favorite pattern jacket. Suze's eyes mist over, and with a relieved smile, Rebecca whips off her spotted shrug.",
    "827": "The gentle golden glow of a street light shimmers on the rain-slick road as people with umbrellas hurry into a restaurant where Hannah, her boyfriend, other colleagues, and Liz sit around a table. Whilst her colleagues laugh, Liz signals to a waiter while Hannah looks disappointed. Liz gapes over at the couple with wide eyes and an anxious expression as Hannah eyes her boyfriend searchingly and steps in close to him. He raises a hand, and she grabs a guy's drink and gulps it before heading off, marching out and high-fiving Liz on the way. Hannah strides through the rain to a bar where Jacob is flirting with a blonde 20-something woman. Frowning, Jacob turns and smiles at Hannah curiously. Rain-drenched, she storms over to him, grabs his face in her hands, and kisses him hard. Slowly, Jacob reaches around her waist, pulls her to him, and lifts her gently off the ground, still locked in a passionate embrace. After some time, Hannah pulls away, looks him straight in the eye, and Jacob smiles happily. Hannah nods curtly and kisses him again before Jacob puts her back down, and she drags him out of the bar while the woman he was flirting with earlier stares at them incredulously as they leave. Hannah stands in the living room of Jacob's apartment, watching the rain through the tall glass windows, as Jacob pours liquor onto a sugar lump in a glass, crushes the lump with a pestle, pours in more liquor, and adds some ice cubes, grating some orange peel into the drink. A stylus lowers onto a record, and Jacob goes into the living room carrying two drinks to where Hannah stands in her knee-length black dress, fidgeting nervously. He hands her the glass, and she glugs down her drink at top speed, cringes, shakes her head, and grabs the other drink off Jacob, starting to gulp that down. She gags and hands back both empty glasses, as Jacob heads over to a coffee table to put them down. Hannah does a nervous twirl while Jacob takes off his jacket and sits down, squeezing his hands into fists. He points to himself, nods, and smiles before taking off his top to reveal a tanned, muscular torso with a six pack. Hannah scrutinizes him as he looks down at himself, and she touches and gawks at him. He smiles smugly, and she limbers up, runs at him, and he lifts her up. Her legs flop before she lifts them up, and slowly he spins around, then stops. She lowers her legs, and he lets her fall into his arms so she's pressed up against his body, sliding gently down until her feet touch the floor as he presses his forehead against hers.",
    "858": "On the roof, Kyle watches as the intruders slope off. They trudge away from the diner. Michael clutches on to Sandra, who sinks to her knees. Jeep helps Charlie up. She looks apprehensive as Michael approaches. Kyle leads in the others from the roof. Audrey tries to console her mother. Bob grimly strides forward. Michael stares at the others. He turns to Charlie. Her smile fades when she sees his somber face and steadfast gaze. Charlie closes her eyes. He loads an assault rifle, turns, and walks away from them. Outside, intermittent bright flashes illuminate the horizon. Kyle is on the roof with Percy. Kyle glances down at Percy, who is crouched low, leaning against a ledge. Percy looks around at Kyle. Percy turns away and leans a rifle over his arm. Kyle looks awkward. Percy watches as Kyle places the gun on the ledge. Kyle shakes his head. Percy blinks and glances down. Tears fall from his eyes. Kyle raises his head, then turns to stare at Percy beside him. Downstairs, Bob turned on the grill, then lights a cigarette with his lighter. He takes a deep drag, then breathes it out. He picks up a can and drinks from it. He looks across the room at Sandra, whose hair, which had been pulled tight, is now loose. He sets a beer down in front of her. Having wiped the top of the can, she gazes at it, then drinks. She sets it down on the table. Sandra buries her head in her hands. In the storeroom, Jeep looks at Michael curiously. Jeep takes a claw hammer off a hook. Michael hangs his head. He walks over to Jeep. Jeep stares frowning at Michael, who wears a benign expression. Michael leaves a thoughtful-looking Jeep. Bob stands on the roof, leaning against the wall. He drinks beer from a can and puffs on a cigarette. Wind whips through his hair. The sky is filled with dense, gray clouds. He flinches at the sound and looks out at a bank of gray mist. Michael stands on the roof, looking pensive. Michael stands on a roof, silhouetted against bright sunlight. He has wings. He's with an elder angel, Gabriel. An army of angels flies overhead. Michael slowly steps across the roof of the diner. The two children swings are blown back and forth by the wind. The strings of light bulbs shake. He drops his beer can. As gray mist rolls in, Bob is sitting by the wall dozing. Sandra is lying on the floor next to Audrey. She wakes and looks around anxiously. She sits up. Hearing the voice, she looks around. She slowly walks through the diner with her arms held stiffly away from her sides.",
    "1122": "Harry gets out of bed, covers his eyes, and blows his nose on his filthy garment, then hits his head with the medicine bottle. Harry grabs Dobby, but Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Harry jumps back into bed as shadows appear in the doorway. A patient is carried in on a stretcher and lifted carefully onto a bed. Professor Dumbledore takes the camera from Colin Creevey's stiff fingers and opens the back, and the film explodes. Hermione prepares a potion, and a ghostly girl in a school uniform shouts in Ron's face, then hovers high above their heads, zooms into a cubicle, and dives head first down the lavatory pan. In the Great Hall, a long platform has been erected, and Lockhart strides along it, tossing his cloak to a group of excited girls. Snape steps onto the platform, and Snape and Lockhart draw their wands and solemnly salute each other. They bow, turn, take a few steps away, then turn again and face each other. Lockhart hurtles backwards down the platform, gets painfully to his feet, and beckons to Draco who steps forward. Looking worried, Lockhart passes Harry, and grim-faced, Harry and Draco approach each other, standing face to face. Draco glares, they salute each other, then turn and walk away. The watching students hold their breath in anticipation as Harry and Draco face each other along the platform. Harry is somersaulted backwards, and Draco smirks at his cronies as Harry scrambles up and points his wand, making Draco's smile fade. Draco is spun in the air, and as he crashes onto the platform, Snape hauls him to his feet and pushes him back towards Harry. Draco points his wand, and a large snake appears in front of Harry, uncoils itself, and moves towards him. Harry backs away, the snake flies into the air, then falls again, raising its head menacingly. Harry moves slowly towards it and starts to speak. The snake fixes its gaze on a boy in the crowd as Harry speaks again. The snake moves closer to the boy who backs away, and Harry speaks again. The snake turns its head, staring at Harry, closes its mouth, and is reduced to ashes. Harry frowns and looks around the hall to find everyone staring at him. Harry runs into the Gryffindor Common Room followed by Ron and Hermione, looks from one to the other, and in a classroom, students are working quietly at long tables. Harry looks up from his books to see two girls staring at him curiously, and he glances across at Ron and Hermione, who both give him an embarrassed smile. A group of students at another table look away quickly as he turns towards them.",
    "934": "As the gypsies walk the horses along a narrow track, one of them rears up, and they look up to see Holmes astride his pony on a higher track above them. They gallop after him, catching him up, and they follow him. It's getting dark as they arrive beside a lake, with a town sitting in the distance across the water. Holmes talks to Watson as they stand beside the horses, and Sim, Watson, and Holmes exchange nods before Holmes and Watson head up. They crouch low in the darkness as six armed guards march past, and once it's all clear, they get to their feet. Holmes pulls a face, and Watson takes the folded-up piece of paper from Holmes and sets off. Holmes crouches, takes another sheet of paper from his pocket, and starts to write. Across the complex, Watson lurks outside the closed telegraph office, glances around, then kicks the door in. At the munitions factory, Holmes climbs over a barred gate and leaps to the ground, while in the telegraph office, Watson pushes open a glass-paned door. Holmes scurries through the munitions factory yard and hides behind a wooden beam. People walk past the telegraph office, and Watson dons a cap and taps out the message given to him by Holmes. Holmes walks along the side of a row of wooden crates, passes a rack of large upright mortar shells, goes to a metal door, opens it, steps inside, stops, and stares at the room containing a number of worktables with machinery. He strolls through it, notices something, stops by a shell, screws open its tip, and lifts it up to find a glass container attached to the metal tip, containing a yellow liquid. Holmes sniffs it and puts it down, continues to wander through the machine room, and comes to another metal door with a glass window in it. He peers through it into a command center where an operations tabletop is covered with a map and models on blocks, including a model machine gun and a sniper rifle, and sees drawings of a semiautomatic pistol, a revolver, and an automatic light artillery gun. On the wall map, there is an image of a cannon times 35,500 and an image of a heavy gun times 15,000. Watson leaves the telegraph office and comes down the steps as Holmes enters another room. Holmes closes the door, walks across a balcony towards a metal rail, leans on the rail, and gazes down into the dark interior. In the dim light, he sees row upon row of artillery shells, and as the lights come on, he sees the full extent of the number of shells. Holmes turns to Moran and throws down his pistol.",
    "1247": "Andy goes in and leans on the desk and pokes her forehead, causing her face to brighten, and he reads her smile. In a huge clothes storeroom, made over and looking fabulous with her freshly fringed glossy hair and an elegant black jacket and trousers on, Andy strides past Serena and Emily and gets the phone while Emily glares at Serena. Nate leaves the restaurant he chefs in, pulls on his jacket, and heads down the street, walking straight past Andy, who is leaning against a car waiting for him. He stops and looks back, taking in her new look from top to toe, noticing the Chanel boots, the slinky jacket, the gold necklaces, the lipstick, and the sleek hairdo. Andy walks to the subway wearing a stylish green coat and shades, with white gloves on and a cute bag, and on another day, she walks the same route with a black coat on, an orange hat, and a different designer handbag. Now, she emerges from the subway in a white coat to match her beat cap with yet another desirable handbag on her shoulder. Andy runs into work across the foyer in heels and a chic black coat, her dark hair scooped up in a bun. Now, wearing a gorgeous flowing black outfit with knee-length boots and a long pendant necklace, Andy is arranging magazines on Miranda's desk when Miranda arrives and takes in Andy's outfit before continuing her call. Nate and Lily are in her restaurant, and there is a bag for Lily as Andy's mates giggle, and she walks out. Andy gets out of the back of a sleek black car and makes her way to a loft in a fashionable apartment building, rings the bell, then sashays down the hall in her black outfit with a big pendant necklace and approaches a sophisticated looking couple, who hand her a black portfolio. They go to the bar, where suave James hands her a glass, and a handsome curly-haired guy approaches Andy. Andy puts down her glass, smiles, and takes her leave, while Christian watches her go. Miranda is in her office going through James Holt's portfolio, wearing a crisp black suit and her shock of grey-white hair is expertly coiffured. In the anteroom, Emily points at Andy, who hurries into the office in a smart black mini dress with white colors and cuffs, while Miranda purses her lips at James' red dress. Leaving the showroom, Andy follows Miranda back at the office, dealing with the key as Emily approaches Andy's desk. A car drops Andy off, and Andy falters in the foyer as there are three closet doors to choose from, while various different tables in the foyer have flowers on them. Andy looks up the spiral staircase and sees the twins looking over the banister rail on an upper level.",
    "66": "The Clerk turns away abruptly and hauls down the northwest valley volume, opening it. It's huge and there's a lot to go through, and the print itself makes him squint. The book shows TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, and even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved, with descriptions like '6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded, but in the owners' column, there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners. The Clerk turns sharply around, and Gittes looks a little surprised. The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, and slaps a ruler on the desk. Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler, opens the book, and places the ruler not horizontally but vertically. Beside the OWNER column, he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the sound of the paper being ripped. Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, and narrower roads, Gittes parks at the edge of the field. He is hefted half off the ground by two younger Farmers who spin him around, going through his clothes, tossing his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet, with his back to the Red Faced Farmer, leaning against the back of his car, breathing heavily. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch, causing Gittes to turn sharply and look up at the Red Faced Farmer. The paper's on the ground, and he picks it up. The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes, who kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head, knocking him to the ground where he lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt. Gittes is staring down while lying in the screened-in porch of the farmers, with his wife, the Red Faced Farmer, the Big Farmer, and the dog present. He has dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots. He looks out and says nothing. Evelyn is driving, and Gittes pulls out his cigarette case, takes one, and offers one to Evelyn, who refuses. It's almost evening. He pulls out the obituary column he'd folded up earlier in the day.",
    "794": "Willie and his companion knock back their drinks, and Willie puffs on his cigarette. She nods and looks at his glass, pours him another shot and then one for herself. They down them in one, and she gives him a coy look. Willie gets into his beaten-up old car. After the festive fornication, Willie leans against the car having a smoke, while she gets out and faces him. He half-smiles and nods, and she gives him a smile and heads off. Once she's gone, the moody-looking Indian guy from the bar runs over and shoves Willie, and Curly Head Fat Ass pulls Mr. Not Gay off Willie. Mr. Not Gay marches off into the night, and Willie catches his breath and turns to Fat Ass. Fat Ass turns to him. Sometime later, Willie gives Fat Ass a lift home in his knackered old car. Sitting in the passenger seat, the kid stares at Willie and smiles warmly, but Willie looks away. Apparently unmoved, the kid keeps staring at Willie. Willie turns off his engine and one working headlight, then gets out of the car with the kid. Willie admires the affluent suburban house they're in front of and frowns. As the kid unlocks the door, Willie pulls out a cotch and puts on a black balaclava. Inside, Grandma is watching a TV program featuring dancing fruit. Grandma walks past Willie, apparently unmoved by the fact that Santa is wearing a black balaclava. Willie turns to the kid, who nods. Willie pulls up his balaclava, opens a safe, and removes wads of cash and a passport, then shuts the safe and goes and sits down in an armchair. The credulous kid beams at him. Willie drives away in a very nice BMW. The next day at the mall, Bob, the manager, is doing his rounds and strolls through a woman's wear shop for larger ladies. Some noise emanating from the changing room catches his attention, and Bob decides to investigate. He looks under a cubicle door and sees a woman's feet and a man's feet behind them, with red Santa pants at his ankles. Marcus gives Bob a reproachful look and takes a candy from a jar on Bob's desk as he leaves. Later, Marcus wanders through a restaurant in the mall sipping a Coke and spots Willie putting the moves on a hot-bodied blonde at a pinball machine. Willie thrusts his crotch into the blonde. As he opens the car door, a pile of empties spills out, and he drives off, crashing them under his wheels. Bob is with Gin, the security chief, who eats an orange while Bob winces at the phrase.",
    "869": "Thenardier is down in the sewer and takes Marius' gold signet ring, putting it on. Valjean grabs Thenardier and shoves him down into the sludge, then gets up and hauls Marius onto his shoulder. With the unconscious Marius over his shoulder, Valjean wades up through the knee-deep sewerage as dim light filters through gratings above, washing over the curved brickwork. The sewerage gets deeper, and Valjean is up to his neck, holding Marius up next to him. He shoves a gate open and drags Marius through an outflow pipe into the dark night, where he looks up and sees Javert standing there waiting for him. Covered in sewerage, Valjean holds Marius onto his shoulder and climbs up steps out of the sewer while Javert aims a pistol at him. Valjean turns to Javert, who holds the pistol steady, considers, then turns and walks away. Wearing a troubled frown, Javert stares at the pistol for a moment, then drops it into the sewer and starts to walk away. Javert stands at the edge of a steep drop into a massive swirling sluice, paces at the edge, then leans forward and drops into the abyss, getting washed away into the swirling foam. Marius wakes in a clean bed beneath a ceiling painted with cherubs and angels, with a child's rocking horse nearby, and his grandfather sitting beside. Outside, women clean blood from the battle off the troubles. Marius sits alone in a room, scarred by battle, with his left arm in a sling, staring into space thoughtfully as tears fall from his eyes. He stands and looks around, his brow arched, and his face wracked with anguish. Cosette sits watching him, reaches out to him, and he limps over to her and takes her hand. Cosette walks with Valjean and the limping Marius into his grandfather's mansion as his grandfather watches. Cosette and Marius kiss, and Marius takes a seat in the spartan room with Valjean, who struggles for words, hangs his head, bows, and then Marius, his arm no longer in a sling but still walking with a limp, takes his leave. Valjean carries a large trunk out to a waiting carriage and grimaces in pain. Marius is with Cosette, and on the journey, he leans back in the carriage. On Cosette's wedding day, Thenardier and his wife hitch a ride on the back of a carriage arriving at the mansion, sneak around to the far side, climb inside, and exit through the opposite door as if they'd arrived in the carriage. Dressed finely, they mingle with the guests, stealing as they go.",
    "24": "Wide-eyed with apprehension, Carol looks at her mother, who nods permission for her to let it go, leading to a last defiant snort from Carol before she is overwhelmed. Carol breathes heavily, gaining control and stopping herself on the brink of crying. Slumped and fought out, Carol asks one last, naked husky voiced question, leading to a beat before he hands back the note deliberately. She takes it and walks back to the service area, embarrassed, confused, and messed with, and tosses the note. After Carol leaves, Melvin looks up, wary, as his brain sends a disturbing message. Carol enters the scene, then exits, as Frank prepares to depart and stumbles back, self-satisfied, relaxing. Frank adjusts and exits as she offers him the note, and Carol notes Melvin’s mood, pausing to look at him for a very strange, long beat before taking an old weekend case from the top shelf of the closet. She looks in another drawer, hesitating as if pondering one of the mysteries of the ages, talks to herself, and puts it back. Meanwhile, Melvin is in his bedroom with everything neatly stacked on the bed, waiting to be packed, including a camera. He checks each stack of underwear, socks, etc., four times and adds another check, as the phone rings. Melvin makes a little comment to himself as he moves, surprised by the call as he has almost no recent experience with receiving nighttime calls. As she picks up the phone, Melvin visibly relaxes. Frank starts to leave, but Simon stops him, and they embrace. As Frank moves off, Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes. Carol puts her bag in the car, and off they go, with Simon and Carol stunned by the manners as they turn onto Fifth. The camera follows Melvin going to a rack of carefully labeled CDs, while Carol chats away. Simon and Carol have thus declared their majority, and Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels both strange and moved by Simon's complex trauma, which contrasts with her own meat and potatoes troubles. She looks out the window, kisses her fingers, and touches them to Simon’s cheek in a nice, understated gesture of friendship, visibly disturbing Melvin. Carol walks to Simon, puts an arm on him, gives him a kiss, and then turns to Melvin before exiting the room, leaving Melvin unnerved. Finally, Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main room of the suite, hears the shower running, and sits down to wait.",
    "844": "She empties out a mini bottle and bites the top off another. Shaking his cup, she turns with a playful smile and sashays back and forth. Diana's smile quickly fades, and she sets down the drinks. Diana blinks her moist eyes. He points to her blue gingham blouse. Big Chuck tenses his face and nods. Diana glances off with a sweet smile as Chuck slowly removes his cowboy hat. He gazes into her eyes. She leaps on him. Sandy listens from the bathroom and rubs his face. Diana grips the bed as Chuck thrusts behind her. Sandy covers his ears. She falls onto her back. Sandy turns on the shower. Sandy ties a towel around his ears as Diana yanks on Chuck's neck with his belt. Now, she holds his legs from behind and bounces rapidly. Sandy buries his head in his hands. Lying on the floor, Sandy kicks the wall. Diana spots Big Chuck's wallet and car keys on a small table, and her smile fades. She finishes buttoning her shirt and glances back at the sleeping man. She notices Sandy's wallet and phone by the room key on the dresser. Stepping forward, she collects Sandy's things and grabs Big Chuck's belt off the floor. The plump criminal shifts in place. Sandy's eyes shoot open, and he pulls the towel off his head. Outside, she staggers away. Sandy yanks on the bathroom door handle. On the other side, Big Chuck's belt holds it closed. She crosses the quiet motel parking lot with a backpack in hand. Diana slings the bag over her shoulder, and it slides off as she arrives at Sandy's car. Sliding into the driver's seat, Diana tosses the bag into the next seat and places Sandy's phone in the center console. She leans forward and inserts the key into the ignition. Sitting back, Diana pulls a small amount of cash from Sandy's wallet and sifts through the bills. Grabbing Sandy's cell phone, she admires the photo of his smiling daughters. Diana holds the phone to her ear. Tensing her face, Diana fights back tears. The thief covers her eyes, then shifts her pained gaze around. Diana closes her eyes and places both hands on the wheel. Removing one, she rubs her forehead. Now, she enters the motel room and puts Sandy's belongings back on the dresser. Sandy crashes through the bathroom door. He quickly kneels. She moves across the room with the ice bucket and sets it on the bedside table. Taking off the backpack, Diana lies down next to Big Chuck. She takes all the blankets, revealing his naked rear end. Sandy stands up and eyes the room. The next morning, Sandy waits by the car as Diana approaches with sunglasses and disheveled hair.",
    "380": "Ahead lies a tiny one-street town, smaller even than Ashton, with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling from the line above are two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together. The main street has stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. A group of about 20 citizens spill out to see Edward approach; most are smiling, and all of these people are barefoot. A forty-year-old man named Beamen comes out of the seed store to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor, carrying a clipboard. Beamen checks the clipboard, still looking, still confused, until a helpful woman named Mildred chimes in. Beamen's daughter Jenny, eight years old, hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger. He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone is laughing. Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by Norther Winslow, who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state. Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes. Suddenly, Jenny yanks off Edward's shoes and races for the door, with him chasing after her. As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line with a perfect throw. The gathered citizens of Spectre cheer for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him, and the men shake his hand, all while he is still focused on his shoes. The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward, and Norther grabs his notebook back. Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him, embarrassed to admit it. He starts to wade back to the bank and climbs onto the shore, completely drenched, pulling up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin, eager to get off this subject. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold fiddlers. The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two women grab him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. From farmer to baker's wife, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool, though he is having a blast. Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly until Beamen plucks his laughing daughter away to dance with her.",
    "274": "The Biker approaches, craning down as he draws near. As the crane descends, he momentarily disappears from view over the rise; then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and, with wheels spinning, becomes airborne. He crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars away. The scene shifts from the desert to a twilight street where the Arizona house is located. The roar of the Biker's engine and the clank of his chains recede as he gradually dissolves into thin air, leaving us looking at the empty street and the faraway Arizona house. Eerily beautiful singing, a woman singing a lullaby, emerges as the receding roar fades. Behind the singing, a droning high-pitched noise is faintly audible. The camera begins to float forward very close to the ground, slowly moving toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched drone becomes less faint under the singing, and the camera accelerates. The drone grows louder, revealing itself to be a human scream as the approach to the Arizona house shows a ladder propped up to a second-story window. As the speed of movement increases, the scream nearly buries the singing. The camera rushes to the house, toward the base of the ladder, drawn in by the sustained scream. Without slowing, it hurtles straight up the ladder, propelled forward by the deafening scream. Reaching the top, it crashes through the white curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery, revealing Florence Arizona with her back to us, screaming over the crib. The view rockets toward her as she turns, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek, drawing in for an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and wildly vibrating epiglottis. The scene suddenly changes as the scream is cut off. The singing previously covered by the scream becomes audible again. It is now morning, perspiration beads on Hi's forehead, as Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing the baby and singing it a lullaby. Hi gets out of bed as the orange sun, rumbling, begins to rise perceptibly. The sun's rumble is abruptly snapped off by the high-pitched ba-WEEEEeeee of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken. We see over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, facing a group of press people on the porch. An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in, and various flashbulbs pop.",
    "570": "Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along behind him. Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. Jay and Kay sit across the desk from Zed. There are five video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk. Next to him, his computer screen beeps importantly. Zed looks over at it. Jay and Kay come out the front of MIB headquarters. Rosenberg, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. Rosenberg comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone—an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid-fifties. Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment—and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seem choked with emotion. Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. The driver hands over some documents. The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. Mrs. Redgick is in front, moaning in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast. Mrs. Redgick screams again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried. Suddenly a tentacle whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, cracks the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold. Now a second tentacle whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight. Jay looks down at the creature cooing and nestling on his chest. It vomits on him. Back in the car, Jay wipes the last of the puke off his suit while Kay starts up the car. Close on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed. Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck. He smacks the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming.",
    "668": "Down below, the hijacked car takes a right, gliding behind him and sending water into the air. Still, the police pursued the stolen car. Up above, Spider-Man is gaining on. He comes lower and lower until he can leap out of the roof of his uncle's car. He punches through it. Spider-Man grabs hold of the carjacker, who pulls a gun. As gunshots pepper the roof of the car, Spider-Man leaps up to the roof of a passing truck. Balancing on both feet, he keeps his eyes firmly on the stolen car, and a bridge moves ahead. Spider-Man vaults into the air, across the bridge, and lands back on the roof of the truck. Spider-Man throws himself onto the car's bonnet and punches through the windscreen. The car swerves, hits a bollard, then crashes into a set of iron gates. A posse of police cars builds up behind a smashed vehicle. The carjacker has made his escape from the vehicle and is creeping to a darkened warehouse, his gun held shakily in his left hand. As he reloads his piece, a shadow looms above his head. He's been surrounded. He shoots at the moving shadow. Trying to run from it, he fails to see Spider-Man lowering himself for a better look. At a locked door, Spider-Man catches up with him. He smashes the car thief's head into the glass panels on the door, then sends him flying across the room. The thief lunges with a knife, but Spider-Man kicks it from his grasp, knocking the balaclava off. Peter strides forward and grabs the man by the lapel. It's the thief from the arena. He remembers only too well letting the man pass and reflects on Uncle Ben lying on the ground, then backs away. The thief raises his gun and holds it to Peter's forehead. Peter knocks the hand away and twists the thief's arm, causing the gun to drop. The thief staggers back and trips. A police spotlight illuminates a second-floor window through which the thief has fallen. It moves down to pick out where he has landed face down. Peter gazes down from the darkness. The spotlight returns to the window, and his features lit up, Peter turns in horror. Police swarm all over the warehouse. They creep forward, guns held in one hand and torchlights in the other. They reach the window to find no one there. Peter is sitting with his elbows resting on his knees out in the open air, a light breeze ruffling his short dark hair, his face sad and his eyes moist. Around and beneath him, the lights of New York. He opens the front door of his home. Inside, sitting in the darkness is Aunt May, wrapped in her padded housecoat.",
    "698": "Peter looks up at the vertiginous tower as if he were at the bottom of a deep well, then tears the tattered, skin-tight black fabric across his chest. A slither of Symbiote falls onto Brock's shoulder, while above him, Peter continues tearing the unraveling Symbiote from his body. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the ledge that Peter is on and snakes down the bell tower, where a globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on Brock's shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that push him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar. The Symbiote devours Brock’s face, and like a wild cat with jagged teeth, he lurches forward as Venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with water streaming over his tightly closed eyes, and then they slowly open with a dead, vacant expression. A short time later, he’s sitting on his floor, lonely and leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the door and holds it, which comes off in his hand. He pries the door open with his fingertips as Aunt May looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf and holds out the engagement ring, dropping it into her palm. He turns away from his aunt’s inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows, his mournful face lit by a ghostly blue glow from the city outside. Aunt May puts the ring on the table, and Peter half-turns towards her. As she softly leaves the room, Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skin-tight black Spider-Man-style suit, Venom swings through the city on web-like strands, only to be grabbed by Flint in an alleyway. Venom fights back and tosses Flint to one side. At night, Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater across the street from Mary Jane’s apartment building, where he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane moving about her apartment in a lit top-floor window. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly fill with tears, and he bows his head and walks away. As Peter trudges off down the street, Mary Jane looks out of the window at the deserted corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later, she comes out of her apartment block in her waitress uniform and hails a cab. Meanwhile, armored vehicles are tossed aside like toys by bursts of sand, and Peter is in a crowd outside an electrical store, watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock.",
    "45": "Reggie sits on the floor of the booth, dialing, while an operator speaks into a headset. From the phone booth, Reggie peeks cautiously over the bottom of the window and sees, through the glass, Adam leaving the Sortie area. Carefully, Reggie opens the door and comes out, goes to the corner, and looks around it as Adam walks away from the camera down the platform. The camera pans to Reggie, peeking around the corner. She looks back once more at Adam, makes up her mind, and starts running towards the exit as the bell rings announcing the next train. Adam turns to look and sees Reggie, and this news hits her hard, causing her to stop in alarm. Reggie stands out in the open with the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to, looking at one, then the other, not knowing what to do, and stops in alarm. During the following, Adam looks around, seeking a way out, and moves out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally behind the second. As he aims carefully and fires, the bullet creases, and the deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed. He wheels around with Carson in the background, who fires at him. Quickly, Adam peers back out and throws another shot. Seeing Carson otherwise occupied, Reggie turns and runs toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her, including Carson, who, seeing Reggie running to the door, turns and fires at her, but he is too late as she is safely inside. Carson looks quickly back toward Adam, then takes off after Reggie. He runs to the door, tries it, and enters. As Carson enters the auditorium, he looks around while the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre—boxes, seats, stage—but there is no sign of Reggie. Carson walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats. Meanwhile, Adam appears in a large room lit by a single bare bulb under the stage, moving cautiously with his gun ready. He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces filling the room. As Carson moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for Reggie, the camera pans down to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside, huddling down, is a terrified Reggie, holding her breath as she watches him. Carson moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board, and throws on all the switches, bathing the stage in light, then returns to the stage.",
    "1215": "The men in the boat wear burnt orange robes and have shaved heads. The boat's motor churns up plumes of white foam on the river as Rambo steers at the tiller. The boat enters more populated territories, where there are wooden homes on the riverside and harbors made of timber. A building on the riverside features a sign with a large painting of a cobra on the wall and a Red Cross sign. The boat pulls in at a harbor where two men stop what they're doing and turn their attention to the boat: one man wears a white t-shirt and a black hat, the other a blue shirt and a bandanna. The boat slows to a halt as Rambo and his men disembark, with Rambo bearing a doleful and weary expression. The sun casts an orange glow on the river water. Surrounded by onlookers, a young snake-charmer crouches alone in an open area facing two cobras, one of which rears and strikes at the dark-haired wrangler. A snake merchant approaches Rambo and gives him cash, while Rambo's men are nearby. Rambo walks away in disgust, heads for the perimeter of the arena, and empties a bag containing the cobra into a wooden crate. A group of Westerners arrive, led by Michael, who has thinning hair, and a blonde girl, Sarah. Michael greets and talks to the merchant, who points to Rambo, as Rambo maneuvers a cobra into the crate and slams down the lid. In the arena, the wrangler teases a cobra while Rambo stands near wire and wood snake cages as Michael and his party approach. Rambo throws a rat into one of the cages and scratches his face idly. Michael seems temporarily lost for words, and Rambo leaves. Michael turns to his party, and Sarah, who is in her mid-20s, pretty with blonde, scraggly hair and a high forehead, follows Rambo out. Rambo is washing his face and hair in a water barrel, then picks up a towel, wipes his face, and hangs the towel on a hook. He walks up to Sarah and fixes her with a firm stare before walking away. He toils alone in a darkened workshop where the only light comes from sunlight outside and the flames of the fire. Using a hammer, he forges a piece of broken steel on an anvil, its end orange and white with heat, then wipes an arm across his sweaty brow as his blows on the steel become more intense. In the darkness, save for the glow of headlights on jeeps and beams from hand torches, the army drags people from their homes and marches them away at gunpoint under the supervision of the cigarette-smoking commander.",
    "1335": "Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit. Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again. The hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Café Musain. Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs towards him - CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs. Students and soldiers fight in the café, on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students are falling. Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers. Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window, knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him, the soldiers hesitate. Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head. Valjean meets his eyes. He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps, towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain. He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the night sky. Here he stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river. The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents swirl around the piles of the bridge. He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he wants some angel from on high to save him - and so, turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close over him. And he's lost. Women move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the slums for whom they died, united now in their grief. Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway. There stands Cosette, waiting for him. Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the house.",
    "1309": "He sits as thoughts crash at his head. He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the green army jacket pass behind his car. Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot. Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine. The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step. Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot. He gains on the army jacket. The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot. He disappears into the subway entrance. Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful. He makes it with great strain to the subway. He looks into the entrance. A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears. Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing. Elijah starts his descent. Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility. and then his foot catches on a step. His hand slips away from the railing. He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum-stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a. His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he moves through the turnstile. The silver handle of a gun peeks out from the belt of his pants. David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes. David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game. Joseph runs out from the huddle across the field to David. Joseph nods. David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college-age man in sweats who stands with the other children. David stares at his son. David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep.",

He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. With his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff continues talking with Gunnison. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well-muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build. The man enters the bedroom. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher, and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. He hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman. The salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. For a moment he is hidden by the wall. Jeff shifts his look more to the right. Jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. It gives no relief. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window. We see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. Jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest. Into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation.",
    "116": "Keyes puts the glass down noisily on Norton's desk, and with the doorknob in his hand, Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves before they go out. The corridor door opens, letting light in as Neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, and puts the key in his pocket. He picks up the phone; Phyllis is on the phone and is not dressed as in Norton's office. He hangs up, takes off his hat, and drops the hat and briefcase on the davenport. Neff looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. The doorbell rings, and Neff stops in sudden alarm. For a second, he stands motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes, who walks past him into the room with his hands clasped behind his back and a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes. Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns, prods his stomach with his thumb, and has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment; Neff hardly breathes. Keyes shakes his head suddenly, prods his stomach again, and resumes his pacing. Finally, Keyes continues and goes on pacing up and down. Finally, Neff can't stand the silence any longer, crosses to the corridor door, and puts his hand on the knob to open the door. The hallway is empty except for Phyllis, who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door has just started to open when Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. Keyes is coming out, and Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door, and he pushes the door wide to hide her from Keyes. He pushes the call button and turns, then pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance. She moves toward him, but he does not respond; instead, he pulls her close and kisses her. Meanwhile, two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work, several visitors are waiting in chairs, and among them is Lola Dietrichson, wearing a simple black suit and hat, indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief, and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously.",
    "1342": "Marius rushes down the street, with Eponine following, towards the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's house. Cosette sees Marius and comes up the garden path towards him, holding the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both hands while keeping her eyes on Marius. Marius wraps his hands around Cosette's as Eponine looks on and suffers. Valjean comes to the door, goes to the gate, and opens it. Eponine screams, and Valjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns to the window. Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows as Eponine's scream finally ends. Valjean comes back to Cosette and then runs into her room, taking her in his arms before leaving to start packing. Feverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter, hurries down the garden to the gate, and places the folded letter in the grill where her and Marius' hands entwined. Eponine steps forward, opens the letter, reads it, and hides it in her pocket. She stands outside Marius' door as Marius looks up from inside. Marius is by the empty house, and we see an intercut between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a barmaid, while Madame Hucheloup, the proprietress of the Cafe Musain, sews a red revolutionary flag to help the students. Javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police Headquarters. Monsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar, slyly watching a student smuggle rifles upstairs disguised as a piece of cloth. Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs, where Enjolras and the students have a production line underway for making bullets. Marius enters the ground floor, takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup, who has just finished sewing it, as Joly collects empty tankards on a tray. As Joly ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to give the tankards back, but Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot to make more bullets. Marius enters the first floor to join them at last. Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout, while Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole. Javert is seen in the police station addressing his men, as we pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at the first floor window with the students beyond them to see that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the street and have all joined in the final chorus. Now into view come the leaders of a great funeral procession, followed by an entire battalion of infantry marching with weapons reversed, and a division of cavalry rides in front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a military tattoo.",
    "325": "In the late afternoon sun, a scene gleams green, gold, and silver. Beyond the river, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until it rises far away like a dark and dreary wall. The sun on Lothlorien cannot enlighten the shadows beyond, where one steps onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light, where the walls are green and silver, the roof is gold, and in its midst is the trunk of the mighty Mallorn tree, tapering toward its crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves, with hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. Frodo looks at Galadriel standing silently beside Celeborn. Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face as Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam. Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo, and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. Aragorn kneels beside Boromir, who looks at Aragorn in despair. Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart. Aragorn returns Boromir's smile, betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away. The Fellowship is asleep on their beds. Bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn, and Frodo's eyes flicker open, as if by instinct. Galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her as if drawn by an invisible force. Upon a low stone pedestal carved like a branching tree sits a shallow silver basin. Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug, and a glow rises from the water. Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal and peers into the glossy surface, where the night sky is reflected. Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface and gasps, his face lighting up with hope. Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely. Frodo looks down, clutching the ring in his hand, and then looks up at Galadriel, who suddenly seems to rise in stature before his eyes, making him afraid. Galadriel suddenly laughs, a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. Frodo realizes what her message is. The Ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand, and his fingers close over it. Meanwhile, naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. The Uruk-Hai are smearing themselves in white paint in a creepy ritualistic ceremony, marking bodies, faces, and armor with the white hand of Isengard. Lurtz is quickly armored with a breastplate, leg guards, and helmet, and a sword is thrust into his hand. Saruman addresses a crowd of 200 fully armed Uruk-Hai.",
    "922": "The chief's Land Rover reverses into a wall, which explodes in a fireball, and Bond is hurled against a wall and showered with glass. Huddled beneath a car, Bond fires at legs, the only targets he can see, then he is up and running. He slams a man in a car door, runs to the stairs, and takes down Green's driver. Camille shoots the general's guards and kicks one so hard he flies over a railing. The general gets off the hostess. Camille rips off her shirt and stands ready in a stroppy white top as Green bounds up the stairs. He places his German friend as armed guard, enters the general's room, and the hostess, hands bound, runs for the door, but is batted aside by Camille, who is then attacked by the general. He knocks the gun from her hand and slaps her. Bond runs upstairs and is aimed at by Green's man just as the compound's main fuel cells erupt, engulfing the meeting area in flames and flying glass. The German is consumed in the fire, but Green runs up the stairs, pursued by Bond. Bond is above Green on the flat glass roof and fires down, causing the glass to disintegrate. He drops back into the building, and Green attacks with a metal bar. Bond drops his gun, and Green grabs an ax from a fire point and flails wildly at Bond. The general has Camille by the throat, pulls off the edge of the floor they are on, and dangles in space, with Bond holding him by the hair. Camille struggles desperately under her attacker, grabs his groin, and kicks him in the face. She dives for the gun and breathes deeply, while Bond hauls Green back up by the hair and dumps him on the floor just as fire falls through the ceiling. Bond runs to her aid as Camille sits crouched in terror, with fire and masonry falling around her. The building is collapsing as Bond tries to reach her. He spots her through the flames, puts his arms around her as the ceiling continues to crack with fire and falling rubble. Bond holds her tightly, spots the gun and picks it up, while her eyes are wide with terror, and he is about to kill them. A burst exposes a fuel cell in the wall, and the blast takes out the whole side of the building. Green has got clear, and Bond watches him go as he and Camille clamber down the rubble, dragging his injured foot. A plume of dust appears in the barren, empty desert. Bond is behind the wheel of a car. He stops, gets out, flings Green to the ground, pulls a can of oil from the trunk, and Green stares down at the can and at the car as it drives away across the vast, empty expanse.",
    "497": "Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight. We are in an antique store filled floor to ceiling with furniture and knickknacks. Anna stands with a young couple, and all three lean over and peer into a glass cabinet where an antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand. The young woman looks at her beau, and she places it in their hands. The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue, while the young man throws an odd glance at his fiancée. The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently before they look down at the ring. Anna moves to the back desk where Sean comes out carrying an antique bench in his arms, places it down, and takes a much-needed seat. Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a birthday present sits on his tabletop. Sean looks at her. Malcolm looks up sharply. Cole is crying now during a long pause as they both just stare. Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes, then pushes it across the table. Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes. Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement, leans his head back against the chair, and stares into the shadows. Malcolm's eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the label. A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk, and Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins in the player. Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial, turns it way up, and the static noise from the tape fills the basement. Cole holds up his plastic rifleman, and Malcolm's eyes show he understands now. Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up at Cole, who looks nervous. Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle at the back of the church, and Malcolm moves around the corner on his street. His mind surges with thoughts, and then he glances up. His steps slow to a complete stop. Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his house is Sean. Malcolm's face turns to stone as he watches Sean come down the front stairs and start across the street. Malcolm moves towards Sean fast, but Sean reaches his car and enters it. Sean pulls away into traffic, almost hitting another car as he does, and Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street. Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and overwhelming pain erupting in his eyes. Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent. He stumbles out. A table with a sewing machine fills the other side of the room.",
    "304": "The fellas crack up, and they all mutter equivalents as Joe stands up. Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger, and everybody whips out a buck, throwing it on the table, except Mr. Pink. Everybody laughs, and they all laugh repeatedly while Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together. Joe comes back to the table as Mr. Orange screams, lying in the backseat, having been shot in the stomach with blood covering him and the backseat. Mr. White, behind the wheel of the getaway car, although driving for his life, keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat, and they are the only two in the car. The door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of Mr. Orange inside, who is still moaning loudly from his bullet hit. Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor, and Mr. Orange looks up at his friend. Mr. White then gets Mr. Orange in a headlock as Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog. Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody, and Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. The two men end up on the floor kicking and scratching as the camera creeps along a wall to a corner where a bathroom lies at the end of the hall. Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view, and he turns to leave. Guns are firing, people shouting and screaming, sirens wailing as Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's locked. The shocked woman starts screaming, and Mr. Pink exits the frame, leaving Mr. White alone. The men share a laugh as we follow behind him up to Mr. White, standing over Mr. Orange, and as he gets closer, he sees Mr. Orange is out. Mr. White stands up, walks over to a table, and Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, pulling it out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, and goes for his weapon, resulting in the two men with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another. Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime as Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. Blonde, but Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away. Mr. Blonde stops moving, heads for the door while the other two men just follow him with their eyes, and then walks out, heading towards the car he drove, with Mr. White and Mr. Pink walking behind. In the background, what looks like an office is set up.",
    "217": "Pappy is considering the crowd, and he drops one arm around Everett and the other around Delmar. Everett hesitates, uncertain of what is happening, while the band beams and Delmar leans into Everett with worry. Delmar gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett considers for a moment. Pappy returns a considered appraisal. On the steps of the meeting hall, people stream out of the concert into the warm summer night. Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps with Penny and raises her left hand with his own to display their wedding bands, but her finger is bare, and she walks off. His attention, along with everyone else's, is drawn to a street procession where a crowd carrying torches jogs behind a man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles escorted by four policemen with nightsticks in riot-ready formation. Everett and the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the steps to meet the oncoming criminal, and Delmar cries out. It is George Nelson, grinning despite his heavy restraints, and as he passes, he turns to call back over his shoulder. Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go. In the blackness, we hear snuffling getting louder and closer. Inside a cupboard, a snout noses the door open. As the door swings wide, light reveals several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade next to a bunch of tangled hairnets. Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy walk through the woods and emerge into a clearing where a cabin stands before them. Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind them and push them forward, revealing next to an oak tree three freshly dug graves with rough pine coffins at the far lip of each grave. The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the porch with a drooling hound at his heels. The goons shove them toward the tree, and three shirtless black gravediggers with bandannas round their necks emerge from the graves and look to Cooley for guidance, as does the drooling hound. The goons recover their leering grins and resume their task while the gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their shovels, with sweat glistening on their faces like tears. Cooley gives a faint smile, and Delmar bows his head to silently pray, followed by Everett. The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell, and the song, seemingly rising from the earth itself, is supported by a palpable bass.",
    "1002": "Gatsby surveys the scene and stands, resting on a cane, as he looks at the clock on the mantelpiece and then at his watch. The clock has a robust, angular dark wood surround. Gatsby paces, undoes a button on his white jacket, and sits, frowning. Nick sits, looking quite relaxed, while Gatsby freezes and breathes tensely. Nick goes to look out of the window as a car comes up the drive, prompting him to hurry outside, holding an umbrella. Grey-faced, Gatsby sits with a newspaper. The driver puts down a rug, and Daisy steps out of the car onto it, wearing blue and gold shoes, a flouncy purple and pale blue dress with frills, and a matching hat. Daisy walks in and checks her immaculately bobbed blonde hair in a mirror, looks into the room full of flowers, and walks into the room amazed while Nick waits in the hall, looking unsure. Nick walks into the room to find Daisy admiring the orchids and, confused, looks to the chair and the window, noticing that the French windows are ajar. Nick smiles at Daisy, who hands him her hat. He goes to the front door and finds Gatsby outside, soaked through. With a steely-eyed, determined look, Gatsby marches into the cottage, stops in the hall to smooth back his hair, and walks into the flower-filled room to stop for a moment and look at Daisy, who turns sharply and sees him. They gaze at each other across the room, with Daisy's chest heaving as she breathes deeply, her eyes appearing glazed, looking entranced. Gatsby steps forward and regards her with an earnest expression as Nick watches from the hall, wide-eyed. Daisy continues to gaze at Gatsby, dewy-eyed, and they both nod slightly. Later, the kettle boils, and Nick carries a tray with a shiny silver tea set into the room. As he pours tea, Daisy sits on a couch while Gatsby stands leaning against the mantelpiece where the wooden clock sits. Nick finishes pouring tea through a strainer, and he and Daisy exchange furtive and nervous looks. Gatsby steels himself, turns to Daisy smiling, but accidentally knocks the clock off the mantelpiece, breaking it. He tries to push the bit that broke off back in place but finally gives up and sits across the coffee table from Daisy, resting his chin on his hand. Nick stands between Gatsby and Daisy, handing them cups of tea, then sits on the couch next to Daisy as they all look rather uncomfortable. Nick stares into space, while Daisy and Gatsby steal the occasional glance at each other. Suddenly, Nick springs to his feet, and on the porch, Gatsby holds up a hand.",
    "3": "The Colonel grabs him by the collar and glances toward the window, where Jane peeks out from behind the drape and quickly pulls it shut. Suddenly, deeply shamed, the Colonel stands, still breathing heavily, and leaves. Ricky gets up, goes to his bureau, and looks at his reflection in the mirror. He calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face. Meanwhile, Carolyn, wearing protective headgear, is holding a Glock 19 automatic revolver with both hands and firing it directly at us. She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated, as an attendant approaches with a new round of ammunition, and she starts firing again. Her face loses its usual resolute determination; she is actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is. The Glock 19 sits on the passenger seat amid some CDs as the Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail and we turn into the Burnham driveway, where a 1970 Pontiac Firebird with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage. The room seems changed: sloppier, more lived in. Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a beer and controlling the car, as his remote-controlled model jeep zooms across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing. She just stands there, staring at Lester, whose working out is beginning to produce results. He smiles at her playfully with the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester just laughs, and his face is close to hers, suddenly charging the atmosphere. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him as he smiles and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet, she's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late; his smile fades, and the moment is gone. He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room. Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry. Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top, and glances at us. We're watching the wide-screen TV in Ricky's room, where a cord leads from the TV to Ricky's digicam. Ricky holds the camera, standing naked, and aims his camera at Jane as she gets out of bed, takes his digicam, and focuses it on him. We see his image on the TV as she videotapes, and Jane zooms in on his face, which remains placid. Ricky smiles and grabs a half-smoked joint from an ashtray and lights it.",
    "884": "Lizzie makes her way over to Charlotte, and he shows her into a room where Charlotte and Lizzie are left alone again. Charlotte takes Lizzie into the drawing room and walks over to the window. Later, Lizzie is sitting reading in her room when Maria rushes to look out the window at a carriage that's arrived. The party is later making its way up a wide path leading to a majestic mansion with elegantly manicured gardens. Lady Catherine is holding court in her drawing room, sitting on an ornate, throne-like chair, and looks at Lizzie, who is squashed between Maria and Sir William on a sofa. Lady Catherine raises one eyebrow and turns her attention to Charlotte, and as she turns to Lizzie, her smile fades and she glares fiercely. Maria, Charlotte, and Lizzie are shown walking outside in the gardens, in the house, Darcy rises from his seat, comes to stand over Lizzie, makes no effort to make any further inquiries, and strides slowly and pointedly over to the window, where he stands with his back to the room. Lizzie looks at Fitzwilliam as Darcy turns to look at her and smiles, but then Darcy turns back to the window, poker-faced. It's a bright, sunny day with the wooded green fields of the English countryside stretching out to the horizon, as Lizzie wanders alone taking in the sumptuous view. She idly pats the trunk of a large tree as she passes by, continues on under the shady canopy of leaves, and stares up into the branches that shield her from the sun's glare. Darcy, riding his horse through the woods, is a picture of elegance in his top hat and frock coat, and upon spying Lizzie, brings his horse to a halt, never taking his eyes off her. Lizzie stops, nonchalantly crossing her arms in front of her, staring up defiantly at Darcy, who looks awkward and kicks his horse on. They set off down the avenue of trees at a trot, as Lizzie watches them, not quite knowing what to make of the encounter. Later, Fitzwilliam sits with Lizzie as she plays the piano, while in an adjoining room, Lady Catherine is listening, with Darcy, Charlotte, and Maria sitting on a sofa near her. Darcy goes in to join Lizzie and Fitzwilliam, and they share an intense gaze. At the sound of the front doorbell, Lizzie sets down her pen, gets up from the writing table, and checks that her hair is straight as the maid shows Darcy in. He bows stiffly, the maid curtsies and leaves the room, and Lizzie takes a seat. A rather awkward silence ensues between them, with neither quite able to look the other in the eye, until eventually, Darcy pulls out a chair and sits down.",
    "101": "She looks up at the sky, where the moon shines above. Forrest lies in a hammock on his boat, then stands at the helm and slowly glides by the docks. Noticing something, he bends down for a clearer view as Lt. Dan sits in his wheelchair on the deck. Forrest looks at Lt. Dan and smiles, surprised, while the boat glides and crushes a dock, which they both look at. Forrest's shrimping boat is alone on the gulf waters, and Forrest looks up to see Lt. Dan sitting in the rigging. Later, Forrest empties the net, while an all-black gospel choir sings and claps their hands. Lt. Dan sits at the back of the church, taking swigs from a liquor bottle. A catch of junk is dumped onto the deck as Lt. Dan lowers himself from the rigging. The wind starts to blow strong, water sprays on deck during a hurricane, and Lt. Dan shouts and shakes his fist from the rigging as wind and rain pelt him. Forrest slides back and forth as he tries to steer the boat. An anchorman on TV stands in front of a ruined pier and boats, while Forrest's boat comes down the river. Lt. Dan and Forrest empty their net, and a huge catch of shrimp falls onto the deck. They continue to open catch after catch, culminating in a huge haul, making both Forrest and Lt. Dan smile. A man sitting on a bench listens to Forrest recount this story as an elderly woman sits beside him. The man laughs and walks away, and the woman looks at both the magazine and Forrest with surprise. Forrest and Lt. Dan are seen working on the boat, and despite Forrest's mild surprise, Lt. Dan smiles and looks away before pulling himself out of his chair, jumping into the water. The television shows an assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford as Forrest and Lt. Dan have dinner on the deck. Forrest opens the door to find a doctor standing next to Mrs. Gump in bed, and the doctor looks down at Forrest's legs before leaving and closing the door. Forrest takes off his hat and steps over to her. Back with the elderly woman, she and Forrest sit as she cries, wiping her eyes with a hankie. A bus stops, and Forrest looks at her. Forrest rides a lawn tractor over the football field lawn, takes out a letter, and opens it while the choir and members sing. New furniture is taken inside, and a new cross is placed on the steeple.",
    "79": "A barn is in the background as the sun rises. In the same position, John awakes. He and Rachel, who lie huddled in calm sleep, get up and start into the kitchen, watching a moment. They head for the stove where Rachel places her gun beside it, ready to hand, and picks up a coffee pot while John puts kindling in the stove. John looks at her for a moment. They look towards a sound as two troopers are shown, with sirens loud as they rapidly approach Rachel's house. Without her gun and holding John's hand, Rachel comes down to the fence. Meanwhile, the other children hurry out of the house behind them. The car brakes as the troopers, fanning wide, advance towards the barn. Rachel and the children are grouped a short distance behind as the barn door appears black. After a short pause, a preacher appears. The troopers close in on the preacher from before and behind, just as they did for Ben's arrest, with the same sickly look as at Ben's arrest. One trooper smacks the back of the preacher’s head with a pistol barrel, and the doll he is holding bursts open, spilling money over him. Two troopers gently lift John away, and Rachel lifts him in her arms and turns towards the house, carrying him as his head hangs back over her arm. Perhaps ten faces, most of them frenetic, watch. Our two loafers are having fun amid the general hubbub, which includes a gavel that stops the noise. John looks over his shoulder in the direction of the gavel, then at a finger. After a short pause, a lawyer’s hands gently help him from the chair and consigh him to Rachel. Above John’s head, Rachel mimics pantomime with a watch while everyone in a cafe stands. Rachel gathers her parcels as Icey rushes to the door, opens it, turns to the crowd, and shouts into the cafe, before turning to the street mob. Rachel hurries her children to the door, and Icey leaves the door to yell at the mob. As Rachel leaves the shot, the cashier shuts and locks the door. Mary and Clary come out first and start walking to the left while Rachel comes out and hurries off to the right, followed by John holding Pearl’s hand. The camera pans to Mary and Clary as they turn, and we pan with them as they hurry after Rachel, bringing Rachel into view as she charges away with her brood hustling to keep up. Icey carries a torch, flanked by rabid faces and smiling loafers, one with an axe. As she speaks, a man rushes to Walt with a rope. The camera pans to Rachel and the children past this street as they hurry towards Ruby, who stands alone in the background facing the jail, with Rachel and the children hurrying towards her in the background.",
    "1285": "The heavy-set man notices and follows him as Klaatu walks up to a snack machine. Watched by a child, he studies the mechanism, then places his hand on the selection panel, resulting in a tuna salad sandwich dropping into the collection tray. The little curly-haired lad walks up and stares at Klaatu, who senses the presence, turns, and stares back. Klaatu stands as the boy continues to stare before being ushered away by his mother. Klaatu watches the ticket fight and takes a bite of the sandwich, while the big man collapses. The thief sees his chance and snatches the ticket back off the prone man, prompting a security guard to chase the thief as his colleague attends to the fallen man. Klaatu observes the scene, then walks into the grubby men's room. Standing in front of the mirror, he pulls back his jacket to reveal a patch of blood on his chest seeping through his shirt. He touches the blood, studies his reflection, and touches a finger to the sweat on his brow before he collapses. A reprimanding look is given as a woman takes the phone. The family next door is unloading their car while crowds mob the offices of the New Jersey Transport Police. Helen pushes her way through the throng and is concerned to see Klaatu sitting on a bench, his head slumped forward. As she approaches, he looks up into her eyes. Evacuees file through the city past fences topped with barbed wire. In the pouring rain, she opens the passenger door of her car and Klaatu gets in, with Jacob sitting in the back. Klaatu turns and looks at the boy, while Helen shoots him a mistrustful look and maneuvers her silver car out into the busy street. She pulls out the sample of his fatty birth skin and dips his finger in, rubbing some of the substance on the stitched bullet wound on his chest, which heals immediately. Helen stares in disbelief and gapes at him, open-mouthed, while Jacob looks puzzled and Klaatu calmly adjusts his tie. Lost for words, she obeys. Meanwhile, two heavily-armed fighter drones hurtle through the clouds toward Manhattan, remote-piloted from the base, skimming between the high-rise city blocks. A pilot's eye view is displayed on a bank of monitors. An orange light glows in the huge robot's head as the Reapers approach, and beams of energy shoot out from the robot's eye slit, detonating the missiles. Beams from the robot are locked on the Reapers, which are sent plunging into two tanks, and the robot's light goes out. The Colonel rips off his headset in frustration. Traffic clogs the nighttime highway, and as Helen pulls into a rain-drenched parking lot, an illuminated golden arches sign is reflected in the car's windscreen.",
    "337": "Denethor continues with his meal as Faramir exits. High above Minas Morgul, on a small ledge next to the stairs, lie Frodo, Sam, and Gollum. Sam watches a sleeping Gollum suspiciously as he desperately tries to stay awake, but slowly, inevitably, Sam falls asleep. Gollum's eyes snap open, he sits up, and quietly crawls towards Sam's knapsack. Sam breathes deeply now, heavily asleep. Gollum grimaces in distaste as he pulls out the lembas bread and quietly sprinkles crumbs over the sleeping Sam before throwing the remaining lembas bread over the cliff. Sam's eyes flick open and Gollum spins around, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, Sam turns away and gently shakes Frodo's shoulder. Sam rummages through his knapsack, looking for a bite to eat, but stops rummaging, shock on his face, and slowly turns to Gollum. Gollum slaps his hand against Sam's jacket, sending lembas crumbs raining down. Sam is enraged, throws himself at Gollum, and punches him. Frodo pulls Sam off Gollum and collapses on the ground, with Sam's horrified face showing. Sam attempts to fuss around Frodo, but a terrible light comes into Frodo's eyes as he stares into Sam's earnest eyes. Frodo pushes Sam away, clutching the ring beneath his shirt, and rises to his feet as if empowered with a frightening intense energy. Sam stares at Frodo with disbelief, tears well in his eyes, and spill down his cheeks as Frodo turns and leaves with Gollum. Sam is in complete misery. Meanwhile, Faramir leads a column of 200 knights through the streets towards the city gate, with people rushing forward, throwing flowers over the knights. Gandalf hurries alongside Faramir's horse, reading the pain in Faramir's eyes, and calls after him, trying one more time to stop the young man. From a high angle, Faramir leads the 200 mounted knights through the gates of Minas Tirith and across the Pelennor Fields towards the ruins of Osgiliath as the people of Minas Tirith watch. Faramir's knights fan out to form one straight line of 200 horsemen as Gothmog and his men watch them approach. Suddenly, fast pushing into Pippin, who looks on as Denethor eats, Gothmog rises amidst the ruins. Faramir's knights thunder towards the camera, 75 yards away, and Gothmog turns to camera and raises his hand. Behind Gothmog, 5,000 Orc archers rise to their feet, black arrows already strung on their bows. Faramir yells defiantly, but in wide profile and slow motion, his 200 knights ride straight into a black wall of flying arrows. At normal speed, fast cuts of screaming orcs are shown, and throughout the above sequence, Denethor continues to eat.",
    "1348": "The boys are scared as they watch the creature hold Woodward tight, lift him, and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose, ears, and mouth. Joe stands and looks intently at the screen. Just then, a muffled shatter-crash occurs, and suddenly, boom, the doors burst open with armed commandos. Donny gets stoned in his car and doesn't notice the movement in the distance behind him, which is the military coming in. In the locker hallway, the boys are handcuffed and scared as they are led out by armed soldiers. Nelec moves to them while Overmyer checks their pockets, and Nelec takes Cary's backpack, opens it, and pulls out some fireworks. Joe is terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple of coins, half a pack of Bubble Yum, and his mother's necklace, dropping everything but the necklace. Joe reacts panicked and is on the verge of tears as Overmyer pockets the necklace. The terrified boys are ushered away and put onto the bus. Boom down to Donny's car in the foreground, where we realize that we haven't been the only audience to this; Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus drives away, his stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to channel 9, grabs the mike, and speaks quietly, frantic. Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area. Preston reads Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine when suddenly Jack is there, grabs him, and pulls him up. The scene pans as Nelec moves back; we push in on Overmyer, who sits near the front, putting on his dark gloves. Nelec sits, which takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus where another airman, Hernandez, 40, sits too. We push past them toward the four boys, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired safety glass, all looking toward us, terrified. Glass shatters as the entire bus is rocked, Charles screams, hurt, and at the front of the bus, Nelec falls and hits a bench. The bus was hit so hard it rides for a moment only on its wheels. The military driver struggles with the wheel as the bus slams back onto the road loudly and a tire blows. The kids panic as the hobbled bus still drives. We push in on Cary, to close-up, looking past the camera, terrified. Charles scrambles to unlatch his seatbelt. Baaam! The bus is slammed so hard that windows shatter, and Charles and Cary, seatbelts removed, land on Joe and Martin. The three soldiers hit the window-floor painfully, Hernandez so hard he's instantly hurt. Nelec rises, scared but pissed. The rear wheels of the bus scream in rotation as we countermove with the creature as it comes around the other side, climbs onto the exposed side, made of metal and window.",
    "331": "All is quiet as Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room when suddenly a large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for him. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free, and spins around to face his assailant as Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight with paranoia blazing in his eyes. Gandalf's clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling, and his hair and beard are much longer and unkempt; he is suspicious and alert. Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest, and without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. Flames instantly consume the envelope, revealing the ring as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs, lifts the ring out, and drops it into Frodo's hand, who reacts to its weight. The gold band of the ring has fiery letters that begin to appear, and a tiny inscription glows red as if burning from within, emanating from the ring. Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it: Mordor. The ring lies between them on the table as Gandalf looks at Frodo, sadly. A teasing glimpse shows Gollum being tortured by the Orcs. On a dark country lane, a Hobbit bounder lifts his watch lantern in alarm as two Black Riders thunder out of the darkness, and a lethal sword swings down at the small Hobbit bounder. Frodo thrusts the ring at Gandalf as he throws clothes into a knapsack, and Gandalf watches him, making plans. Frodo is preparing to leave, and Gandalf looks at the young hobbit, moved by his courage. Gandalf freezes and moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension, as he raises his staff above the window and slams it down on the intruder, resulting in a yelp of pain. Gandalf hauls a small figure into the room, revealing Sam Gamgee sprawled across the floor, looking up in terror as Gandalf looms over him. Hobbiton is shrouded in a white veil of mist, revealing Gandalf, Frodo, and Sam hurrying across a ploughed field, away from Hobbiton. Gandalf leads his horse as Frodo and Sam are carrying knapsacks, guiding them under the cover of woods. Gandalf takes Frodo to one side, and Frodo nods, patting his pocket. Frodo and Sam hike over the gentle Shire countryside, wading through a shallow stream. Sam stops short, taking stock of his surroundings, then takes a deep breath and steps forward, his brown, furry foot hitting the ground as Frodo and Sam continue their journey. Meanwhile, Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible as Gandalf gallops through the gate into the fortress of Isengard, a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, enclosing beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains.",
    "651": "The boys burst into the room. Jamal stares dumbfounded at Latika. She smiles in recognition. Maman and his henchmen stand at the door. Punnoose's face is now badly scarred. She avoids Maman's eyes but doesn't move. He reaches over and grabs her roughly. Salim draws a revolver from behind his back and points it at the men. Jamal looks astonished at his brother. Maman draws closer. Maman leers at Salim. Salim places a cushion over the gun. Jamal recoils in horror. And the men tremble. Latika rushes to take Maman's money from the floor. Jamal is rooted to the spot. The three children flee the scene. On the game show, Jamal looks deep in thought. The host points his hand at Jamal mimicking holding a gun. The scene of Maman's death replays. The host looks down at his computer screen. Young Salim, Jamal, and Latika sneak past the sleeping guard and break into a brand-new but unoccupied hotel. They run up a deceased elevator into an atrium door with an enormous gold chandelier. Inside the hotel room, Salim gleefully pours two bottles of spirit into a pot while Jamal picks a towel out of a cupboard. Jamal shakes the dusty towel and takes it to the bathroom door. Salim gulps down some beer. Salim suddenly looks solemn and leaves the room. Salim steps out onto the street. Jamal has his eyes closed and head turned away from a semi-naked Latika. She smiles as he squeezes his eyes tightly shut. She goes back into the bathroom. He keeps his eyes closed for a moment more then slowly opens them. Salim crosses a road busy with tuk-tuks, cars, bicycles, and carts. He approaches a cinema kiosk, hands over a coin, and receives the ticket. On a large balcony above the cinema, six men are drinking and playing a gambling game. None of the men notices Salim as he steps onto the balcony and swaggers over. They ignore Salim as he takes out his gun from behind his back. He points it at one of the men's heads. Salim slowly turns to face Javed, he nods. Javed beckons to Salim. In the hotel room, Jamal and Latika lie on a mattress on the floor. Latika makes graceful hand shadows on the wall. Her arms are painted in intricate gold and henna designs. They stare at each other for a long time. Salim returns to the room. Jamal and Latika snoozing on the mattress. Salim stands over Latika. Both Latika and Jamal wake up. He holds out his hand for Latika. He leans towards Latika. Jamal rushes Salim. Salim eventually overpowers the smaller Jamal and ejects him from the room. Salim emerges, pointing a gun.",
    "1096": "Zus holds a protective hand in front of his face while people watch in mute shock; Tuvia, with a livid scowl, drops the stone on the ground and gets to his feet, as Zus sits up and wipes his mouth. Straightening his jacket, Zus looks around at the assembled people staring at him, and Benzion picks up his gun. Zus addresses Asael, who's standing with Chaya; the two young people look at each other, and Zus affectionately pats Asael on the cheek. Zus then turns to find Bella standing behind him; without a word, he grabs his machine gun, and with a line of volunteers behind him, strides off past Tuvia. At Nowogrodek, Nazi soldiers stand guard as Jewish men and women wearing yellow stars file into the ghetto, while Tuvia and Asael stride purposefully past the ghetto entrance. They carefully tread along a low-tiled roof, climb down at the far end, and hurry towards the interior of the ghetto. On an unpaved woodland track, the army general Panchenko, astride a tall black horse with Gramov at his side, rides at the head of an infantry column toward Zus and his men standing by the side of the track. Panchenko nods at Zus, who nods back. As the Russian commander moves on, Zus and his men fall in with the Russian foot soldiers. Inside the ghetto, a Jewish elder addresses a room packed with smartly dressed, solemn-looking people. Tuvia addresses two women in the room, then looks despairingly at Asael. A beautiful young woman steps forward. Under a cover of darkness, as people stream out of a house tearing off their yellow stars, one Jewish man hiding in a doorway peers toward the floodlit square where German guards are on duty in front of the barbed wire entrance to the ghetto; he beckons to Asael across the dark narrow street where the people have gathered. Asael ushers them out through a hole in the wall and into the street, leaving behind a pile of yellow fabric stars. At daybreak, carrying bags and cases, they walk in single file across the wintry landscape towards a windmill and on into the Birchwood forest. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin sit behind a makeshift desk on which people are putting their valuables, and she and her parents hug each other. Shimon addresses an elderly man, while Tuvia shows the man a loose trigger on a rifle; the watchmaker hands back the rifle and the trigger works. Tuvia sits on his horse, and young and old listen with rapt attention as Malbin nods approvingly. A curly-haired boy turns to Lilka, the beautiful newcomer, while Asael supervises shooting practice. Elsewhere, women are sitting at sewing machines.",
    "35": "Sam begins to play it very softly and then prepares to move the piano away. For a long moment, he just looks at her. Meanwhile, Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar, and as Rick sees Ilsa, he stops short, appearing shocked. Sam stops playing. Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other, and Rick sits down as he and Ilsa look at each other. Laszlo signals the waiter, and Rick takes the check. Renault leaves, and Ilsa smiles as they join Renault at the curb. Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood, and Sam sits down at the piano, starting to play softly, improvising. Suddenly, Rick pounds the table and buries his head in his arms before raising his head, trying to regain control, holding his head in his hands. Rick just stares ahead as orchestra music slowly joins Sam's playing. Later, Ilsa fixes flowers at the window while Rick opens champagne. Rick drives a small, open car slowly along the boulevard with the background scenery changing to a country road as she snuggles close to him and puts her head on his shoulder; he puts his arm around Ilsa. On an excursion boat on the Seine, Rick and Ilsa stand at the rail, seemingly transported by each other as Ilsa laughs. They see the Arc de Triomphe from a distance, and she walks over and joins him. They drink inside a swank Paris cafe, and Rick and Ilsa dance, appearing to be very much in love as the music plays. Ilsa flips a coin, then tosses it over to Rick, and they kiss passionately. During the backdrop of the rubble of a burned-out, demolished building, German troops cross a river as tanks roll down the road toward Paris and German war planes fly overhead. A man sells newspapers to people crowded around him, and there is much excitement. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table, buy a newspaper, and begin to read it while nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a loudspeaker on a wagon. At the bar, Rick gets glasses and a bottle of champagne, walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano, and pours the champagne. Ilsa seems unnerved, evidently having something on her mind, while Rick's manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness seen in Casablanca. Sam looks at his glass, and Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window. She smiles faintly and looks at him tenderly. Rick takes her in his arms and kisses her hungrily, and while locked in an embrace, they hear the dull boom of cannons, to which Ilsa reacts worriedly. Ilsa looks at Rick, and he chuckles, then chuckles again.",
    "85": "John turns his back and looks out the window beside the bureau and then throws the hairbrush, striking Preacher's head, and he is sure now Pearl knows. Preacher's hand locks the door as Willa, in outdoor clothes and not dressed for work in the parlor, enters with her back to us and stops, smiling benignly. Willa keeps smiling and, still smiling, shakes her head in disbelief as she makes for the house while Pearl screams. In a narrow screen setup similar to an earlier corridor scene, Preacher and Willa's eyes meet, and he turns. Willa is calm and immobile with the ecstasy of a martyr as Preacher hits her across the mouth. Preacher then hears the voice and starts to move out of the close shot, moving over to the coat on the back of the chair. His hand goes into the pocket and brings the knife out, the same coat and pocket as in the wedding-night scene. He pulls down the blind and moves toward the bed as the knife clicks open in his hand, and he raises his arm to strike. Later, he is scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch, looks up, and moves towards her as Walt enters the shot with a pipe. They enter the kitchen, where Walt clucks his tongue and moves towards the kitchen cabinet, pours, and snaps it down in weak defiance, then looks towards off-screen. He sits at a table with his back towards us, mumbling over his Bible, closes it, and turns to them with weepy eyes and a brave little smile as Icey smiles sideways, happy to let her mouth fall open and let out a gasp. We pan with slowly streaming weeds and bring in Willa in close profile; the current coming from behind her drifts her long hair across her throat, and she is in profile as before. It descends, catches on the windshield, and the line tautens and tugs. We start to follow the line up, continue to follow the line, and bring in close the stern of Ben Harper's skiff as he sits back, tugging unconcernedly at the line. Then he leans over to see what's wrong, peers over the side, and we start moving before he does. With a low camera angle capturing his full figure, we tilt to frame him from the waist downward and follow close behind him as he leaves the tree and walks along the side of the house. We tilt downward and close in, following only his feet as he steps past a tiny cellar window and we pan and tighten in close on it, where their noses are flat against the glass, their cheeks touch, and their window isn't quite big enough to hold both their heads; it is on the ground, and we don't see their chins.",
    "1010": "The Queen gives the corgis food, and the corgis look up at her before running through the clearing. Video footage shows crowds of people lining up in a queue, and a sign is seen. All around, the ground is covered in floral tributes. Later, Charles talks with Steven, and Tony looks at Cherie before leaving her with her paperwork. Elsewhere, the Queen sits at a desk writing in a book, but she suddenly stops writing. The next day, three Land Rovers drive away from Balmoral. On Wednesday, Robin stares out of a window, with a blond woman sitting behind him, and a man sticks his hand up as Tony stares back at them. The Queen signs the letter, and Robin looks from Prince Philip to the Queen. The Queen walks over to a desk, sits down, picks up a phone, and glances at the sun. The Queen puts Tony on the speaker and glances at Prince Philip, then arranges pens and a magnifying glass on the desk. Tony casts his eyes skyward, stands up, and looks out of the window, still gazing out before picking up the phone on his desk. Tony puts down the phone, pauses, then leaves his office, stroking his chin thoughtfully and stops beside a female secretary who sits behind a desk. At Balmoral, the Queen exits a Land Rover and enters a building. The Land Rover drives through the hilly and woody countryside with the Queen in the driving seat, continuing along a long, bumpy, and barren road parallel to a river. The road runs down to the river's edge, and the Queen plows into the waters. As she heads across the ford, rocks and potholes on the riverbed jolt the car, and the Land Rover comes to a sudden, violent halt in the middle of the river. The Queen steps out of the car, into the mountain waters, and inspects the underneath of the vehicle, continuing to examine other parts of the Land Rover. The Queen holds a mobile phone and dials a number. Back at Balmoral, Thomas sits at a desk, and the Queen hangs up the phone, then removes the headscarf she is wearing. She gazes at the serene countryside surroundings, shuts her eyes for a moment, looks down, frowns, then looks up. The vast landscape dwarfs the figure of the Queen, who sits on the riverbank by the vehicle. The Queen remains seated, her back turned away, and her body gently rocks as she starts to sob. After a few moments, she turns to her left and sees a stag on the opposite side of the river, which stands still.",
    "212": "The whistle of an approaching train is heard as the train comes to a stop, and Harry is among the first to get off, followed by an attractive girl about the same age as he is, named Ruth Dakin. In the excitement of greetings, Ruth is momentarily forgotten, standing and smiling, waiting, as George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded, with George thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand and kisses her. The camera moves with them down the platform, but George stops with a sinking feeling while Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot, and Harry stops with George before running out of the shot as George watches him. George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth, thinking deeply, as the camera moves with him when he comes into the scene. Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn, nodding and smiling. Cousin Eustace takes a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch, and flash bulbs go off as the group breaks up, with the crowd entering the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch, the latter tipsy and feeling very high. Uncle Billy looks around for his hat, which is on his head, and George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him as they descend the porch steps and George turns his uncle around, heading him down the street. George stands at the garden gate, obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events, as he takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them, and throws them away. His mother comes out of the house and kisses him, nodding toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the music of a phonograph, and are seen through the front door as they kiss. Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head, and George stands in the middle of the street, hands in pockets, obviously undecided about what he wants to do. As a girl passes, he turns to watch her for a moment, while Violet is locking up for the night, with a couple of men crowding around her, each intent on taking her out. She looks up and sees George standing there, and the camera pans with Violet as she crosses the street to George. Violet, who takes her beauty shop seriously and is an eyeful, is sensed by George to be far from immune to her attractions, as she links her arm in his and continues down the street with him until they stop walking and face one another, with her eyes seductive and guileful as she looks up at him.",
    "1148": "Harry smiles. As evening falls, they join the excited crowds in the magnificent Quidditch stadium. The spectators take their seats in the stands, many of them wearing colorful national costumes. He stops Harry with his walking stick and then smacks at him. Spotlight beams illuminate the packed stands. Hermione and the twins wear green and white scarves. Mr. Diggory takes them to the highest level of the stadium. The seven Irish players zoom out in formation with green and white smoke streaming from their broomsticks. Fireworks explode in the shape of a spirited leprechaun dancing a jig. The opposing team in black and red fly high above the pitch, and one turns a somersault. A gigantic image of the handsome Bulgarian player is projected onto the towering stands. He hovers in front of a waving flag proclaiming the name Krum. Krum raises his fist confidently. Cornelius Fudge uses his wand to amplify his voice, and a bright ball of light springs from his wand and plunges down towards the arena. Back in the tent, George and friends celebrate the Irish victory. Mr. Weasley lights a lamp and hurries them out of the tent. The camp is in chaos, many of the tents are on fire, with flames leaping high into the darkness. Harry sees ominous cloaked figures with skeleton masks and tall pointed hats, carrying flaming torches. He starts to run, and wrestled away from Hermione and the others, Harry dodges through the panicking crowd. In the confusion, Harry trips and falls. As he struggles to get up, flying feet knock him aside. Light from the burning tents flickers across his face as he lies unconscious on the muddy ground. Everything goes black. A full moon shines down on the devastated camp. A lone figure strides between the smoking tents, kicking the smoldering remains. The figure points a wand into the dark sky and casts a spell. A huge, ghostly, green skull appears with a snake emerging from its mouth. It floats above his head. The young man bears his teeth with an evil smile of satisfaction. Harry slowly regains consciousness and sits up. He sees the shadowy figure approaching through the smoke. Harry gets to his feet and runs away from the dark figure, and the figure runs off. Seeing the skull, Harry clutches his scar. A group of Ministry wizards gaze up nervously at the ghostly skull, a dark mark still hovering above their heads. Ron counts his money. Harry nods to a young Chinese girl, and she gives him a shy smile. Harry scratches his eyebrow. Hermione leans forward. Harry addresses an envelope to his godfather, Sirius Black, and puts the letter into Hedwig's beak. The snowy owl flies out of the train window and sows away over a lake as the Express steams on towards Hogwarts.",
    "845": "At the front desk, the attendant hands him a clipboard. Outside, Diana opens the car door as Sandy pours himself a cup of coffee and a brown utility van pulls into the motel parking lot. The skiptracer walks around and sees Diana sitting in the open passenger side. Inside, Sandy stirs his coffee while the skiptracer pulls Diana from the car, and he notices the abduction through the window. Sandy runs outside as the skiptracer pushes Diana into the van, locks the door, and hurries to the wheel. Sandy runs over and watches the van speed off, then he quickly shuts the passenger-side door and gets behind the wheel of his rental. Sandy backs out of his parking spot and speeds away from the motel. On a narrow country road, the skiptracer talks on his cell phone as Sandy comes up on the van. He moves into the oncoming lane and pulls up beside the van. Diana opens a window, and spotting an oncoming car, Sandy hits the brakes and swerves behind the van. Diana pushes against the gated partition while Sandy pulls up beside the van again. The van speeds toward an intersection's red light, cars whiz by as the van turns sharply, and Sandy follows, barely dodging the oncoming vehicles. His sedan skids up alongside another car and he peels away onto a two-lane highway. Sandy speeds up beside the skiptracer's van, but the skiptracer swerves at Sandy, sending him into a grassy median. Sandy recovers on the other side, facing oncoming traffic as speeding cars swerve out of his way. Guardrails lie on both sides of the road, trapping Sandy with the oncoming traffic. The skiptracer peers out of his window, watching the businessmen at their numerous vehicles. An 18-wheeler speeds towards Sandy and he swerves toward the median, launching the sedan off a mound of dirt so it soars through the air and lands on its tires in the grass as Sandy rejoins the van on the right side of the road. In the van, Diana pounds a cylinder against the partition lock and breaks through. The skiptracer elbows her stomach and holds her back, but Diana punches him in the throat and he falls limply against the steering wheel. Sandy slows down and lightly hits the back panel of the van, barely nudging it. Diana notices a merge up ahead, and Sandy eyes the runaway van, gripping the steering wheel as he takes a breath. He speeds into the side of the van, causing it to flip over. Sandy stares wide-eyed as the van continues to flip into the median, then stops the car and watches the van land right side up. Sandy unbuckles his seatbelt and slowly emerges from the car. In slow motion, he hurries toward the van with his mouth dropped open.",
    "707": "Peter smiles and looks at the ring, then slips it into the pocket of his jeans before opening the door to Mary Jane, who holds up a newspaper. He gives her a warm, guarded smile as she sits down. Peter smiles feebly, and Mary Jane nods sadly, then looks down dejectedly. Peter, in his Spider-Man suit, gives her a little smile before putting on his head mask and leaping out of the window. Mary Jane stands up, gathers her bag, scarf, and newspaper, and goes for the door. Across the room, the black spider-like tendril crawls across a cabinet behind her but freezes when she looks around. She leaves the apartment, and the slimy, black mass drops to the floor. On a city street, two cops look up to the sky as a huge, towering jib crane swings around, its driver struggling with the controls. Meanwhile, Gwen is part of a photo shoot in an office, and the photographer checks his shot. Gwen and the other two models turn to the window as an enormous steel girder hanging from a chain swings towards them; they throw themselves to the floor as the girder smashes through the window, ripping out the supports along one corner of the building. A desk and other debris plummet to the ground. Captain Stacy arrives on the scene as, in the devastated office, Gwen helps another model up. The huge yellow jeep of the crane swings back towards the office, smashing out the supports beneath it. The office floor gives way, and desks and furniture tip out through the smashed windows. Gwen slides down the tilting floor and just manages to hang onto a telephone cable, but the cable snaps, and she clings onto the very edge of the floor. A blonde-haired young guy runs up behind Captain Stacy and starts taking photos, but Stacy grabs the guy's camera and looks up at his daughter through the telephoto lens. Gwen's eyes widen in horror as a desk slides towards her; she releases her grip on the floor but manages to grab onto a long metal rail just below. As Spider-Man approaches, swinging from building to building, the metal rail falls loose from the wall and buckles, swinging Gwen out above the streets hundreds of feet below. As Spider-Man swings and leaps towards the skyscraper, the crane's jib rips out through the building, sending huge chunks of metal toward him. Dodging the debris, Spider-Man just manages to catch Gwen, saving her from being crushed by two clashing slabs of concrete. Spider-Man swings down to the pavement with Gwen in his arms, and Gwen hugs her dad. As Spider-Man swings away, Gwen gazes after him. In his office at the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson is in a meeting with a marketing guy.",
    "1086": "Tuvia, weaving his way between the trees, is knocked off his feet by an exploding shell. As he groggily struggles to raise his head, his blue eyes seem dazed. Behind him, a bunker explodes, throwing bodies in all directions in a cascade of debris. In slow motion, a man runs through the trees amid the dust and flames. Tuvia, clutching a slender tree branch with his body position dazed, watches a bomber fly across the sky about to drop another bomb. Malbin appears out of the haze and pulls him towards a shelter just as Asael arrives. Tuvia slaps down against the wall of the bunker as the planes fly away. Asael breaks from Tuvia while Malbin herds people out of the bunker. The survivors run through the trees, some carrying bundles and others armed with rifles. Chaya clings desperately to Asael, and he and Tuvia take up gun positions behind a bunker. Asael glances sideways and sees Chaya positioning her rifle. He watches his young wife being urged away. His nose bleeding, Tuvia walks away from the burning remains of the camp, leaving a few men and women, including Lazar, Lilka, and Asael, standing behind the mossy roots of their bunkers with weapons poised, keeping their sights fixed on the woodland ahead of them. Deeper in the forest, the rest of the community hurry through the bare trees. The shooters leaning on the roofs of the shelters scan the horizon, and one woman is hit. Asael fires at the unseen enemy. Tuvia stops to listen to the sound of gunfire as another man goes down. Asael, keeping his head low, scurries to a new position, and a machine gunner falls to the ground while Lazar runs on. The others give Lazar cover as Asael scrambles sideways, firing as he runs, and the bunker behind him is blown to smithereens. Asael pulls an injured woman, Layla, to safety. Lazar, with rifle in hand, ducks behind a tree and reloads. Seeing Asael crawling towards him with Layla hurt, he propels himself out from behind the tree and runs towards the enemy, but his body is tossed into the air like a rag doll. Asael looks behind him and sees a female shoot a hit, her arm still clinging to her machine gun; her head goes limp, but the gun goes on firing. Deeper in the misty forest, Tuvia, at the head of his flock, strides on with a machine gun held across his body. Further on, with Malbin, Bella, and Shulman behind him, he comes into a clearing, but his pale blue eyes scan the horizon. Stretching ahead of them with no end in sight is marshland. Aron and Rachel, along with Tamara cuddling her baby, look up at the sky.",
    "1244": "Don sits in the chair to Brian's left, the presenter to Brian's right. Brian shoots a scathing look at the presenter. Don smooths out his tie. The floor manager points at the presenter. Brian's grin sticks. Brian fades to silhouette as the lights dim. Brian nods bitterly as Don and the presenter rise from their seats and stroll away across the studio floor. Still sat in his chair, brooding introspectively, Brian glances over at the TV crew who wander out of the cavernous studio as the lights go out. Brian sits in the darkness on set, the switched off cameras pointing away from him. Brian drives past Elland Road in his Blue Merc with Nigel and Simon in the back. The lads read comics and annuals as Brian broods at the wheel. He looks in the mirror at them. The boys swap wide-eyed looks on the back seat. Brian smiles as the boys stifle giggles. The boys huddle close behind Brian, excitedly. The chalk cliffs of the south coast. Girls wheel over the Brighton Promenade in the sunshine. Brian stops the car outside a large red brick house. Peter's wandering among the shrubs and plants in his front garden. He looks over at Brian in his car. He stoops over a flowerbed. His eyes fixed on Peter, Brian gets out wearing a heavy frown. Still bent over the flowerbed, Peter glances over at Brian then carries on weeding. Brian puts his hands in his pockets as he strolls up the drive. Peter shoots Brian a withering look. Peter looks down at his plants. Then, he steps back with his hands on his hips, admiring them. Eventually, he turns to Brian with disdain. Peter turns back around. Peter takes a step closer to kneeling Brian, scrutinizing him. Peter points at Brian. The boys exchange puzzled looks in the car. Peter walks closer and stops. Peter strolls towards his house, then turns back. Brian fixes Peter with a sincere, imploring look. Peter looks at Brian, then hangs his head and shakes it. He rubs the finger of his clenched fists together. Then, he raises his open hands out towards Brian. Brian stands and walks towards his old friend. Brian throws his arms around Peter and hugs him close. Peter screws his eyes up and returns the embrace. Then, he scowls. Brian is wide eyed as he speaks into Peter's ear. Peter blinks slowly and shakes his head. A tender smile spreads across Brian's face. He tightens his embrace and closes his eyes. They step back and look at each other. Peter thumps Brian's shoulder playfully. Peter nods over Brian's shoulder towards the boys in the car. Brian beckons to them. The boys scamper to Peter.",
    "646": "Jamal's mother screams at the boys as the attackers bludgeon defenseless men and women, and Jamal watches as his mother is clubbed in the face. She falls back into the water, and the boys help each other out of the pool and run. Jamal looks back for his mother, but Salim urges him onward while a man falls and is stamped on by a mob. Salim and Jamal run past another man throwing a Molotov cocktail at a door, fleeing down an alley where they come face to face with a young boy dressed as the Hindu god Rama, covered in blue paint with his hair bound up on his head. Both of them run, passing the girl, Latika, hiding in an alley as a man sets another man on fire. The boys run towards a police station, with Latika falling behind. Inside, the policemen are playing cards while a man runs into the street with his clothes in flames, and the policemen do nothing. The boys run again, beckoning Latika to follow, and Jamal's mother lies face down in the pool. In the present day, back in the police station, Jamal remembers seeing the young boy dressed as the god Rama. The boys had been frozen to the spot momentarily, staring at the bow and arrow in the boy's hand. Back on the show, Jamal is lost in thought. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on high ground looking down on their slum burning amidst the riots, while Latika stands some distance away. In the street, Latika stands drenched in the torrential rain as Jamal and Salim sit in a shelter; Salim rolls onto his side, and Jamal looks at Latika in the rain for a moment before lying down. Jamal and Salim's mother screams as flames explode, and Jamal wakes up as Salim lies with his back to him, wide awake. Jamal looks at Latika still out in the rainy street, seeing her squat down tracing letters in the puddles; he calls out to her, and she stands up, runs over to the shelter, and squats next to Jamal. Latika shakes her head while Salim's eyes remain wide open, and she lies down next to Jamal. The three children lie on the floor out of the rain, shivering in the cold. In the present, Jamal sits on the studio stage opposite the host as people scavenge on mountains of rotting rubbish while lorries offload more refuse sacks. Jamal appears pensive in the studio, while on the rubbish tip, Latika picks through scraps with a stick. She looks up when a minibus arrives, turns, and shouts as two men emerge from the minibus and approach a makeshift tent, counting two pairs of feet. Inside, Jamal and Salim lie dosed in the tent amidst the rubbish.",
    "604": "Hermione puts one arm over Harry's shoulder, the other over Ron's. Ahead of them, Katie Bell lies on her back in the snow, her body wrenched from side to side. She shoots up into the air and hovers with arms outstretched, her mouth open in a muted scream, then crashes down onto the snow and lies on her back, her head shaking. Hagrid arrives on the scene, and they step aside as the giant Hagrid picks Katie up. Harry walks towards something on the ground, a necklace of blue stones lying on the snow, tipped out of its box. Harry folds back the wrapping paper, and, back inside its box, the necklace lies on a desk. Professor McGonagall studies it and then turns to Leanne. Hermione, Ron, and Harry face McGonagall as Snape arrives. Snape waves his wand, and the necklace rises into the air. McGonagall looks at Snape, the others stare at him, and Harry is the last to lower his gaze. Harry lies on his bed with the Marauder's Map and sees Malfoy moving on it. Ron lies in bed with his hands behind his head; both boys look uneasy. Harry takes off his glasses and puts them on the map on his bedside table, and Malfoy disappears from the map. At Professor Slughorn's supper party, twin girls look around at Hermione, and everyone's enjoying dessert. The door opens, and Ginny comes in, having been crying. Harry is the only one to stand as Ginny approaches the table, grinning politely as he bends down to retrieve his napkin, with Hermione watching him. Cormac, eyes fixed on Hermione, sucks his little finger suggestively, causing her to turn away in embarrassment. Slughorn turns, eyes wide, as Harry stares at the photographs. Taken aback, Slughorn stands rooted to the spot while Harry gives a faint smile. The sand in the hourglass drifts slowly from top to bottom, held upright by snakes with green glass bodies and golden heads. Ron, in his Quidditch gear, including his leather helmet, enters the Great Hall looking totally miserable. He sits down in front of his breakfast, a fried egg on a square of dry toast surrounded by four toast triangles, as Hermione smiles knowingly and Harry turns away. Lavender bounces up and goes, leaving Ron looking even more miserable. Harry passes Ron a goblet; Ron looks at Hermione and Harry, then lifts the goblet to his lips and drinks. Hermione glares as Harry smiles, and Ron smiles broadly. The two friends clasp hands over the table. The game is played in a snowstorm, as a bound leather Quaffle zooms through the air, caught by a Slytherin Chaser, whose green cape flaps behind him as he joins his teammates, flanking him as they charge for goal.",
    "433": "He turns on his stool to watch the game. Eddie goes back to his bottle of beer. Some bills drop on a ragged, beat-up pool table. Two men, dressed in work clothes, stand around looking disgruntled. They go to the bar. Eddie sits at a table, smoking, waiting. The paper bag with the whisky is on the table. He mashes out his cigarette in the ashtray. Sarah, dressed in a dark suit, limps toward him. When he looks up, he sees Sarah standing nearby. She seems cold and suspicious as she limps toward the table. She pauses and looks at him. They stare at one another for a long moment. He gets up, puts his arm around her shoulder, and walks away with her. As they walk, she hesitantly puts an arm around his waist. A hand reaches up to open the wooden shutters. As they open, we see Eddie, in his underclothes, on the bed. Sarah, in a robe, walks up and joins him in bed as they both peer out the window. She hands him her cigarette. He starts to put on his wristwatch. He kisses her on the cheek. He kisses her again, this time on the lips. He reaches out and closes the shutters. Sarah emerges from a neighborhood grocery store loaded down with a Cheese Doodles carton full of food. A woman runs out of the store to give her a parcel she left behind. He pulls her schoolbooks out of the carton and takes her purse. She unloads liquor and canned goods from the carton, then goes to join Eddie by the window. Sarah takes a cigarette lighter out of her purse and hands it to Eddie. He takes it. She smiles, then she gets up and returns to the kitchenette. He comes up behind her and puts his arms around her. She cuts her hand opening a can. As he rummages through the closet for his bag he pulls out his leather cue case. They kiss. Someone knocks on the door. Sarah goes to open it. We stay on Eddie, who examines the lighter in his hand. He enters the room, awkwardly, toying with the rim of his hat. There is a long silence. Charlie sits. She starts to make the drinks. Eddie leans up against the wall, listening. Sarah watches them both, curious, confused. Suddenly Eddie becomes tense. Sarah turns to fix the drink. Eddie signals her to stay where she is. He moves forward, confronting Charlie. Eddie walks off. A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek as she hears this. She stands near the door, with her back to both of them. Charlie gets up and moves toward the door. Sarah, her cheek wet, says nothing.",
    "967": "She grips two high heels, a coat, and an open champagne bottle which she sets on the counter. Her unblinking eyes stay on him. The woman sits on the counter. David straightens, his gaze fascinated. As David faintly nods, the smiling woman shakes her head. Their amused smiles relax as their stare lingers. David breaks the gaze. The two strangers gaze at each other, and then converge abruptly in a deep kiss, caressing each other passionately. As their kiss ends, their faces still hover close. A second onrush of kissing overtakes them. The woman jogs out barefoot. Charlie smiles. David follows her. She peers back. Two men approach. She loosens his tie. She hurries off. Now in the ballroom. Backstage Charlie and other aides applaud. David peers at his supporters, then briefly bows his head. He glances back stage. He holds up a shoe. Numerous flashbulbs pop. Now dark clouds drift over Manhattan. On a pleasant city street, largely devoid of activity. A shiny black town car stops by Madison Square Park. A rear passenger door opens. The oldest member of the mysterious four-man team from the rooftop gets out of the car in his fedora and overcoat. He confidently enters the park. Farther along, the mustached stranger sits on a bench. The older superior sits beside him. His superior walks away. The mustached subordinate peers after his boss with a faint smile. Across from the park, a well-kept residential building shows beyond a few trees. Inside David sleeps. He wakes and turns off his alarm clock, which reads six o'clock. Later, David sips coffee. Later, David carries a to-go cup of coffee as he crosses a park. As David and his fan go their separate ways, the mustached stranger remains on his park bench, his head bowed and his fedora brim tilted to shade his face. David hurries across a street. A clock on the side of a building reads 7:05. Sunlight glows through a tree's branches, bathing the stranger's face. He awakes. Blinking, he glances around, then pulls out his hardcover book and checks a bookmarked page. He jumps to his feet, spotting David, who boards a bus. The stranger races after it. David notices him through a bus window. The stranger keeps sprinting, as David looks for a place to sit. He smiles. The lovely woman from the election night sleeps with her head leaned against a window. As David takes the seat beside her, she stirs. David checks out her thighs and miniskirt. She notices him and beams. Outside, the mustached stranger still sprints after the bus. She stares at him. David grabs his phone. A car speeds past the running stranger. The bus pulls up to a stop.",
    "210": "Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. George and Mary are dancing. They mistake the screams for cheers. George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool. Spotlights concentrate on them. The crowd is watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. George and Mary are still trying to dance in the water with the crowd on the edge cheering them; some of the crowd leap into the pool; the principal tries to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver, and leaps in himself. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in a jersey sweater and oversized football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bathrobe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera, we hear them singing. The camera moves with them as they proceed down the street. He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on. In his confusion, George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bathrobe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm. George looks after her, then picks up a rock from the street. It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent. George hurls the rock at the house. We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass. As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand. The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the sound of breaking glass. Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after her. George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street. Man on the porch of the house is listening to George and Mary. They have stopped walking and now face one another.",
    "1323": "Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes. Charlie tried hard to push, and there it is a baby's cries. Audrey stood stunned, standing wide-eyed and holding up the child. Audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out of the static, the haunting sounds of Bing Crosby singing \"Silent Night\" fill the room. The quiet before the storm. Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up. She stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes. Those words provide her little comfort. Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much. Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael. The baby cries louder. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey. Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie. Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. Michael cocks his gun, points it at Sandra. Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes. Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core. A brilliant spectral light pours into the diner. She raises a hand to block the light. And that's when Michael fires. BLAM! Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead. Michael fires again, blowing Sandra's body back through the doorway. Jeep watches the baby sail slowly through the air. Jeep dives for the baby, catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground, and then he looks up to see the dark silhouette of a man approaching from out of the spectral light, a man with wings. Jeep's eyes grow wide as the fierce angel steps into the diner. The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision, and now that we see his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical-looking mace in his powerful hands. The world returns to normal speed as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep. Jeep rolls, clang! The weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally cracking the ground. Gabriel brings the mace up again. With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. Michael grabs Jeep's hand before the boy can rush back into the fray. Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words. And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the keys to Michael's police cruiser. Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey, and the baby.",
    "1265": "Snape bends down and picks a plant with two leaves, which flutter like wings, and he guides it to Lily. The red-haired Lily smiles at the boy Severus, and he glances at her. Then, they both look up at the Willow tree above them as the wind rustles the branches and the leaves fall flying like tiny birds. The fluttering leaves skim over the water. The image changes to Lily wearing the Sorting Hat, and she glances at Severus as she walks down the hall. At the dining table, another boy sits beside her, while the pale-faced Severus looks at her, doe-eyed. James smiles at Lily, who gazes back at him. Lily and James kiss and dance. Voldemort kills Lily, followed by an image of Wormtail, and Snape's face softens. Dumbledore's blackened hand, Draco and the vanishing cabinet, and the night of Dumbledore's death, which Harry witnessed on the Astronomy tower, appear. There are images of Voldemort, and Harry, restless in his sleep, and the night of Lily's death. Snape enters the bedroom in the house in Godric's Hollow and finds her dead beside Harry's cot. Snape is overcome with grief, and he gazes at her lying lifeless on the floor. There are tears in baby Harry's eyes and a raw, jagged scar on his forehead. Teenage Harry peers through a doorway as Snape raises his wand and completes two circles in the air, creating white wisps of cloud that gather to form a Patronus in the shape of a beautiful silver doe. It leaps out through a window, and longingly, Snape watches it leave as Dumbledore spins around, mouth agape. Snape rocks Lily's lifeless body in his arms, his face somber. In the forest, Harry sees the doe approach, and the black swirls and the Pensieve return. Harry lifts his head out of the bowl, his eyes wide and anxious. Dazed, he slowly backs away, holding his hand to his heart, then sits down on a step, his face unshaven and dirty, staring ahead blankly. He sits motionless, then walks downstairs along pathways cleared amongst the rubble. He turns on a landing and sees Hermione and Ron sitting together on a step further down. He pauses, stares at them, and descends. They start to follow him, and Hermione holds Ron's arm, fighting back tears. She rushes forward and flings her arms around Harry's neck. Over her shoulders, Harry glances at Ron, who lowers his gaze for a moment. Hermione unwraps her arms from around Harry, and they separate. Harry takes his leave, and Ron moves over to Hermione. Side by side, they watch as Harry slowly makes his way down the stone staircase. Outside, Harry walks slowly across the deserted courtyard, where the remnants of flickering fires cast his shadow before him. He enters The Forbidden Forest, treading carefully, and stops by a tree.",
    "1365": "Debbie gets out of the shower, followed by Pete, who sneaks down the hallway and kisses Sadie (13) to wake her, but she wants to be left alone as Pete breathes all over her while talking. Pete lifts a sleeping Charlotte (8) out of bed, walks her downstairs in a ridiculous manner due to her being too tall to be held like a baby, and they set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table, decorating the room with birthday balloons and streamers, with Pete occasionally sneaking bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth. The house appears more cluttered and messier than previously depicted in Knocked Up. Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette while Sadie watches Lost on her iPad and Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen; Pete clears the breakfast dishes, turns on the faucet, and pours water on a cupcake. Meanwhile, Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard, and Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes. Debbie is in workout gear when Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit with multiple logos. As Debbie leaves, Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the sink and takes a bite. Debbie then runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer Jason while her friend Barb trails behind. We then see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente with his friend Barry, narrowly avoiding a collision when a car makes a right turn in front of him, prompting him to bang on the back of the car. Meanwhile, Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down, with Barb stretching on a yoga ball in the background and Jason demonstrating exercises. Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, enjoying some alone time to delay returning home. The family is driving with Sadie watching an episode of Lost on an iPad, and, during a violent scene, Charlotte grabs for Sadie’s iPad and starts trying to lick her. Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street into a store where they see their two employees, Jodi and a new, gorgeous employee named Desi, who is up on a ladder. Debbie goes behind the register, looks at Jodi, while Pete is still staring at Desi before he walks over to Debbie. Desi then comes down to help a customer at the front of the store. We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside, doing a full flip and landing on her feet, with Pete nowhere to be found. Finally, Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking.",
    "422": "The Kentucky-bound train rolls down the track while Bert and Eddie finish their breakfast coffee in the dining room. Sarah is in the washroom and then makes her way down the aisle to join them at the table, where she stands silently, absorbing an insult. Bert gets up and reaches into his pocket for his billfold as Eddie and Sarah just stare at him. Later, they are at a table sipping drinks, with Bert shuffling a deck of cards as he talks and Eddie, like a schoolboy, listening intently, while Sarah sits apart, watching them both. Eddie glances at Sarah, who stares mutely at Bert, and then he reaches across to light Bert's cigarette with the lighter Sarah gave him while Bert's own lighter is on the table before him. Sarah sees it, picks it up, and sparks it into flame as Bert goes back to shuffling his deck of cards. The lobby is thronged with gamblers, their women, sportsmen, and tourists, all there for the Derby, with a jazz combo audible over the din of their voices. Eddie, looking excited, leads Sarah through the crowd with Bert behind them, his face now shaded by dark glasses, as he follows a bellhop to the main desk, forcing his way through people to get there and displaying a neatly folded wad of money in his hand. Eddie laughs and moves toward the open door leading to the billiard rooms, his face glowing as he watches the flow of men moving in and out of the crowded room, and hears the sound of clicking pool balls while tucking his cue case under his arm. He then turns to Bert and Sarah, who join him, before Sarah turns toward the elevators with Bert behind her, jiggling his keys. The bellboy unlocks the door, allowing Sarah to enter as the doors to the other suite are open. As she catches sight of Bert arranging things with the bellboy, she closes one door, and the bellboy leaves as she moves to close the other. Bert comes to the door, holding it open, and then turns away, leading to a long pause as he glares at her before going back into his room. Sarah closes the door and leans against it as screams are heard while the horses jerk out of the starting gate to begin their runs. Eddie cashes in a winning ticket and moves through the ornate racetrack bar to join Sarah at a table, where she has been drinking. As she puts the money in her purse, Bert sits down, and we see Findley studying his program and holding a drink, appearing tall and refined, with a pale, debauched, yet oddly youthful face that some men over forty sometimes have, while a cork-tipped cigarette dangles from his fingers.",
    "1270": "Harry and Ron are standing by Dobby's grave when Bellatrix approaches them, and we find that Hermione has transformed to look exactly like Bellatrix. Reluctantly, Griphook slides the sword into her bottomless bag as she joins Harry and Ron, who is disguised as a long-haired, bearded Death Eater. Ron holds out his hand, palm upwards, and Hermione and Harry grasp his outstretched hand; Harry then turns to Griphook, who places his hand on the others. They apparate in a dark and gloomy street by Gringott's Bank, where a cloaked man spots Hermione, who walks ahead of the others, but the cloaked man moves away. Harry bends down, and Griphook climbs on his back as Ron flings the invisibility cloak over them. Standing in the imposing banking hall, Hermione glances anxiously back at Ron, then stares wide-eyed at the rows of goblin tellers ahead of them, teetering in her unaccustomed heeled shoes. As a goblin teller looks up, she tries to look austere as she swaggers along, with Ron, wearing a long, black coat, walking behind her with his head bowed, and hidden under the invisibility cloak, Harry and Griphook follow. Harry spots an armed guard, and we note that Hermione, like Bellatrix, has a strand of long black hair over her right eye as she stops in front of a wizened old goblin behind a high desk. The goblin continues to write in his ledger as she regards him haughtily with arms folded. He looks down at her, then turns and leaves his desk while a teller looks up, and Griphook whispers to Ron, who sees an armed guard slowly pacing toward them. The old teller returns to his desk with Bogrod, a bespectacled goblin, and under the cloak, Harry and Griphook have moved nearer the desk and stand beside Bogrod. Harry casts a spell, and Bogrod's demeanor changes as he smiles benignly. Griphook is driving a cart along a twisting rail track, hurtling through dark, underground tunnels, with Harry and Ron sitting on his right and Hermione on his left, and Bogrod, in his happy, mesmerized state, sitting behind his fellow goblin facing back of the track. Traveling at incredible speed, the cart's single headlight illuminates a waterfall gushing beneath the track. Griphook brakes desperately as the track twists down towards the waterfall; they pass through the cascade, and the rail-cart comes to a halt, activating an alarm. They're tipped out of the cart and plummet, but they stop falling, then land safely, and all five get to their feet and look up at the cart as it trundles away. Harry turns to Ron and Hermione, and Ron recast the spell on Bogrod, who smiles benignly again, as Ron leads them in semi-darkness towards a cavern where a huge, gray, spiky dragon lies chained on the ground, and Griphook takes something from an opened wooden crate and hands it to Ron.",
    "1260": "Two safety guys stand by as Carl dives off and free-falls hundreds of feet towards a river, then gets whipped back up by the heavy-duty elastic. Waving his arms, Carl swings back and forth beneath the giant, curved bridge supports and takes out his phone. Meanwhile, Wes is on a golf course and hands his phone to a caddy. At Norm's, there's a Sparta-themed party where Norm wears a red cape, holds a shield and spear, and later sits weeping with Carl beside him, looking anxious with his hand on Norm's shoulder. Norm wears a false beard and mustache, which starts slipping, and Carl sticks it back in place before looking down humbly. At home, Carl checks his answer phone. At the Bigfoot Lodge, the sign shows an ominous figure in a forest, and Carl stands outside the entrance looking pensive. Peter and Lucy walk up, and Carl leads them inside where he and Peter dance. Janet offers a piece of cake to Lee, and Faranoush looks again. Norm leans against the bar, looking morose, and Carl taps him on his left shoulder and leans round to his right, at which Norm bows. Norm dances around with his hand on Soo-Mi's shoulder as they walk off, and Lucy is with a group of friends. Carl catches her eye, smiles, and waves. Lucy points around the room and gives Carl a big thumbs-up, and they share a fond smile. Sitting alone at a table, Carl makes a phone call while Allison is at an exhibition of her photos, opens and then closes her phone as a woman looks at a photo of Carl sprawled on the ground. Allison smiles tightly, and the woman raises her eyebrows. Peter sits next to Carl and smiles. Meanwhile, Rooney stands at the bar alone, and Tillie walks up and smiles at him broadly, while he looks at her warily and then has a drink, knocks back a shot, and ushers her out of the bar, looking back cautiously as he goes. Carl arrives home, she kisses him, and he responds, kisses her for a moment, then pulls away sharply, looking pained. Carl gets into an elevator, presses a button, the doors close, and as the elevator descends, the light flickers. Carl looks up, the elevator stalls, and the doors open to reveal it's stuck below the level of the floor. Carl clambers out, walks off along the hall looking around cautiously, and as he walks across the forecourt, a black cat runs past behind him. Carl stumbles onto a car bonnet and sees a guy hooking his car up to a tow truck, realizing the guy is himself. Carl runs from his hallucination as Terrence drives away from a hotel with Carl popping up in the back of the car, and Terrence hits the gas.",
    "1340": "Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses, and then Valjean sees a nearby lamp bracket. The narrow street turns and opens out onto the river, but they follow it around a corner to find a dead end, so Valjean stops. A high wall is before them and they are trapped. Valjean looks around, and once on the top, he hauls Cosette up by the rope. A cloister appears as he sings, he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights reflected in the river below and then up at the great city. The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world. Gavroche, bounding over their heads and evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs or taunts the rich. Still running with Gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, he hitches a ride on the back—one or two of his gang hop on back of the carriage with him, while others run panting after to hear his political lecture. The carriage reaches an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd made up of citizens of Paris, student revolutionaries, the poor, and beggars. The students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd, and a student, Enjolras, stands on a raised step making an impassioned speech with fellow student Marius. A priest is seen hurrying into the house accompanied by two altar boys. In the crowd, a young street girl, Eponine, has her eyes fixed longingly on the handsome Marius. The occupant of the stopped carriage is Monsieur Gillenormand, Marius' grandfather, who is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity. Mounted police ride in to break up the crowd, and Marius turns to see his grandfather staring him down, furious. Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage. Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty mattress in a tiny hovel of a room, taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His eye is caught by the family crest ring on his finger, and close on a signet ring, Marius stares at it then takes it off his finger.",
    "1253": "Rows of film studio buildings are reflected in the shiny gold surface of a shield with the letters WB at its center, followed by a series of 3D metallic Vs, one inside the other. A brown-haired guy in his 40s, Carl, rejects a call from an unknown caller, stares down blankly, tenses, takes the phone out again, hangs up again, then takes his phone out and fumbles, accidentally answering it and sighing. He holds it to his ear, turns to the window, and sees Peter wave. Carl moves his mouth, grumpily hangs up, and is then at the Bigfoot Lodge where a ring causes everyone to turn and gawk. The guy nuzzles her as Carl eyes Rooney, with Ted and Stephanie frowning at him. He bashes into a waitress and slips, ending up on the floor with a tray of drinks. He stands up, stiff as a board, and trudges off past a crowd of staring people. At home, Carl dons a suit jacket and studies his reflection in the mirror, pops a name badge into his pocket, then smiles at himself. As he leaves his apartment, a small white-haired woman creeps up behind him and smiles. Outside a cafe, a guy bins a flyer as Carl sits at his computer and spots a colleague springing out of his chair, with Norman hanging up. Carl swallows and, outside the bank, he rejects another call from an unknown caller, sits down on a wall, and takes out a leaflet. Carl frowns as Nick leans over him, lobs the rock, and is open-mouthed as two security guards run out of the building, one taking him down and the other leaping on top. Nick leaps over a wall as Carl is in his car rejecting an unknown caller and winds up his window as a guy selling oranges approaches and then passes the man outside the cafe. At his desk, Carl browses DVDs in the video store, sits alone on the sofa in his smart apartment, and watches a film. He frowns, pauses the film, goes to the door, and peeps through the spyhole as Peter hurries off, shutting his door with a worried expression. Peter and Rooney enter Carl’s flat, Rooney goes to the fridge, and Peter heads over towards the sofa, furrows his brow, and studies something. Carl is contorted but stiff, a fly lands on his eye, and he wakes from his nightmare and sits up with a start on the couch, wide-eyed and disheveled. He stares into space miserably, swallows, frowns, and thoughtfully gazes down at something on the table, examining it as he makes his way towards the rows of seats and sits down. On two screens, Carl jumps out of his skin.",
    "974": "She glances around and frowns to herself, her lips parted. She answers her cell as the front door opens and David enters. She waves at David and nods at the phone; David hands her a cup of coffee and then fixes his own coffee in the kitchen of the one-room flat. She hangs up, noticing her phone shows four missed calls from Adrian. David looks up knowingly, his thoughtful gaze drifting as she glances aside and her lips spread into a sad smile. David blinks and moves to a chair at her bedside, as she meets his gaze. Swallowing hard, Elise averts her eyes. As she looks at him again, she smiles wistfully while David gives her a contented look. Her eyes glimmer with tears as she meets his gaze and David crooks a smile. Elise's smile fades as she stares into David's earnest eyes, and they gaze tenderly at each other before blinking and David looks away. He juts out his jaw, then locks eyes with her. Now Elise sits in a green room as, in the studio, David shakes Jon Stewart's hand and waves to the audience. Meanwhile, a guy in a ball cap enters the green room, Elise's shoulders sag as the man leaves, and she collects her belongings. Now as David leaves the studio, the man in the ball cap opens the door for him. David texts as he walks through the doorway, and lifting his gaze from his phone, he finds himself in the Adjustment Bureau warehouse. He whips around to the closed door but finds it locked, tries another one, then attempts to lift a loading bay door. Now David sits with his back against a support beam, and as he stares off, a figure appears—the steely-eyed adjustment officer approaches. Rising, David stares at him and looks Thompson in the eyes as Thompson paces away from him. David follows, observing Thompson standing still, his thoughtful eyes blinking, shifting his gaze to a bay door which begins to rise. With a determined look, David hurries past Thompson to the exit as the adjustment officer blinks his disapproving eyes. Meanwhile, at Cedar Lake, dancers perform on one section of a low, L-shaped stage, twirling gracefully while male dancers leap across the other section, drop to their knees, and spin. David rides in the back of a cab, his eyes shifting to his window as the city's glimmering lights glide past. The taxi slows in front of Cedar Lake, and now David enters the dance studio, joining a group of patrons standing near a tiered section of stage. Elise sits on the top platform, her feet resting on a bench below it; as she hunches forward, a group of dancers gathered behind her lifts her into the air.",
    "710": "Spider-Man hits wreckage and glides off it as if it were a ramp, landing on top of the van and hitting Flint with a volley of wet balls. Flint punches Spider-Man off the roof, and although Spider-Man clings on, Flint punches him into the truck. As the van heads for a collision, Spider-Man pulls the guards out, firing a thread out of the back of the van, which flints and crashes into a parked truck. Flint watches from the edge of a building above as Spider-Man staggers out of the red van, looking around frantically. As Flint moves off, the rescued guards drop from a web spun across the street. Spider-Man wheezes up to the ledge of a building, pulls off his mask, and shakes sand from his hair, then pulls off his left boot and shakes out some more sand. Later in the evening, Peter, dressed smartly in a sober suit with his dark hair swept across in a neat side parting, stops a few feet away from the entrance of the restaurant constellation and pulls Aunt May's ring out of his breast pocket. Looking agitated, Mary Jane strides up alongside a newsstand and storms off with a face like thunder. Inside the restaurant, Peter takes in the opulent splendor as diners and waiters flip past him, walking across the reception area where he's summoned by a maitre d' behind a small counter. The maitre d' has brought a pen on a silver platter, examining it with dark, beady eyes as Peter hands him a note. Clenching his fist, the maitre d' then leads Peter to a table before scurrying away. Peter snaps out of his role play as he sees Mary Jane coming towards him in a little black dress. He shows her to her seat and chivalrously pulls out her chair for her, then spots simpering blonde Gwen waving at him and waves back. The maitre d' summons the champagne, but Peter hurriedly shakes his head, leading the maitre d' to wave the waiters away. Gwen waves at Peter as she walks away, and he waves back again. The maitre d' takes this as the signal, and helpless waiters are called off again as Peter shakes his head. The maitre d' bringing the champagne glasses passes Mary Jane as she storms out. Peter stares after Mary Jane in shock as the maitre d' sets the glasses down on the table and the waiter brings a champagne bucket. As a violinist serenades him, Peter picks up Mary Jane's glass and fishes the ring out of it with a fork, then dries the ring with a napkin.",
    "240": "He starts to scale a wall, looking as though he's getting away, but there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle that flares into light, swivels, and finds the man. A volley of shots follows, and the man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies. Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent and shocked, with the only sounds being the weeping of the people opposite and, nearer, Mother crying softly. Szpilman, as if in another world, plays the piano in a cafe full of customers, although the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously, and the mood is sombre. A doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the cafe entrance, and the doorman lets her in. Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing Halina, in a state of great anxiety, beckoning urgently across the heads of the customers. Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps off the platform, and threads his way through to Halina, who is shivering and almost unable to speak. Szpilman starts running through crowded streets filled with corpses, sweating and dodging, sidestepping people until a woman, the Feather Woman, bars his way, her brightly rouged cheeks and thickly painted eyebrows beneath an unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. He tries to dodge past, but she grabs his arm. Szpilman manages to free himself and runs on to a mob of men in front of a building, being herded by Jewish policemen. More and more captive men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos), and the mob constantly swells. Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd and scans the mob, seeing the Jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men. Szpilman becomes alert, as he's seen someone he recognises—Heller, with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton and driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller, who glances around and shoves someone aside so Szpilman can approach while he continues to beat and manhandle people. Heller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away, leaving Szpilman standing, jostled by the crowd, uncertain and forlorn. Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building where there are comings and goings, with German soldiers in evidence, and the mob is smaller now. Szpilman waits and watches as a poor woman passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper, followed by a ragged old man dragging himself along. The ragged old man, shivering with cold and showing his purple feet through the holes in his shoes, suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman.",
    "268": "A hand grenade pin hangs, glinting, from one of his fingers, as pawing at Lenny's chest he must have hooked his finger through its ring. Reacting and reacting to Hi reacting, he looks down to see the bandoliers across his chest with silver pins glinting in all the grenades except one, where its squeeze-lever juts at a right angle. Hi's jaw drops and the lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots. Scrambling to his feet and trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands, in his panic his fingers tangle in the trigger guards. Starting to run, he finally frees his hands and dives behind the parked car. His hands fly in to wrap around the grenade, but too late, bright light blows sky-high. There is a roar, as if the earth were cracking open, and flame, as if hell were slipping out. We pan the fire to the sky where a white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness, clanking softly. The top of the ladder arcs toward the camera. Late at night, the nursery is dark and empty, of the unpainted crib with the burned-in names: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan Jr. As we pull back from the headboard, Ed's arms gently deposit the sleeping Nathan Jr. into the crib. Hi puts the singed copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care next to the baby as he and Ed look sadly down at the baby. The silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze-me toy as the lights are snapped on, startling Hi and Ed. Nathan stands in his jammies, hair disheveled, holding a gun and squinting against the light, keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed as he slowly raises a pair of eyeglasses to his nose and advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his gun. Hi and Ed back away from the crib as Nathan peers in, studies the baby for a moment, lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby, and holds him to his chest with a tear forming at the corner of his eye. Hi and Ed quietly move back towards the ladder as he bounces the baby, studying Hi and Ed, and Hi shrugs. Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib, turns around with a thought, and Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity. She stands looking into the crib, and Hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib, and Hi murmurs something to comfort her. Nathan is studying the two of them as Hi turns to face him and speaks in a rush. Nathan looks at her, finally nods, and sighs.",
    "255": "A disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt is launched into frame by someone offscreen, as the hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height markers. His picture is taken, and it is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it. HI obliges but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye, on his eye-skewed profile, as Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell. At the far end of the corridor, a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor, and the Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes. Panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs, the pan starts on Hi. At this point, the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back; he is addressing one of the Cons. The huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting his brow in consternation. Three PAROLE OFFICERS - two men and a woman - face Hi across a table. A beat-up Chevy pulls into the all-night store's empty parking lot, and Hi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding a pump-action shotgun. He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the store. Full-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot wall. Hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is obviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the camera, on Hi's profile. He turns back to Ed, looking up through her tears as Hi is led away, as another police officer starts to lead him away, struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out the door. The door slams, as Hi is once again escorted toward his cell. The Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw him as Hi passes, and Hi looks sheepish. Two convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE, appear to be friends. Hi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling, Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. He spins and grabs his car-door handle, locked. He tries the back door, locked. As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. On Hi against the mug-shot wall, we see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet.",
    "1118": "The car heads straight towards the ground as they both wrestle with the gear stick and Ron waves his wand desperately, but it snaps. The car heads towards an ancient willow tree standing in the school grounds and plunges onto the top branches. High in the tree, the car rocks precariously and falls backwards, getting stuck halfway down. Ron holds up his broken wand as hefty willow branches attack the car, causing the vehicle to rock and the windscreen to shatter. A branch smashes through the back window, and branches attack from all angles, showering them with broken glass. The car suddenly tips forward, bounces from branch to branch, and falls towards the ground, landing on the grass. Ron presses the accelerator and the car zooms away. The tree lunges after them, but they escape its clutching branches. Clear of the angry willow, the boys breathe a sigh of relief. Suddenly, the car doors fly open and they are hurled out onto the grass. The boot opens, throwing out their trunks and luggage. Harry catches Hedwig's cage, and Ron peers anxiously at his pet rat. The car starts, the doors shut, and the battered car drives itself across the grass towards a stone archway. Harry and Ron race after it as it rolls down a cobbled passageway and zooms away towards the forest, leaving Ron and Harry far behind. Later, they haul their luggage into school and leave it on the landing before running upstairs. Filch, the caretaker, with his cat Mrs. Norris, is standing at the top of the stairs. Hogwarts School is housed in a handsome castle surrounded by stone outbuildings and long Victorian greenhouses. In one of these, a class of students stands waiting around a long bench filled with rows of potted plants as a short, plump woman with curly, gray hair in a brown smock and a matching tall, pointed hat enters wearing a pair of earmuffs. The root looks like an ugly baby as they cover their ears. A boy collapses as they pull out the screaming roots. Showing off, Draco Malfoy pokes his finger into his Mandrake's mouth and it bites him; furious, he throws it into a pot. Later, in the corridor, the ghost of Sir Nicolas floats into the Great Hall where the students are sitting at long tables while Ron is trying unsuccessfully to mend his broken wand with sticky tape. A boy takes a photograph as a tatty gray owl flies down into the room, swooping low over the table towards Ron but colliding with a bowl and scattering crisps everywhere. Draco and his cronies snigger as Ron takes a red envelope from Errol's beak. Ron nervously breaks the seal on the red envelope, and to his embarrassment, it starts to scream at him.",
    "1059": "At school, young women walk with books balanced on their heads, lead to dance, and circle the hall in pairs. Later, they use whisks in the cookery class. Heavy snow is falling as a teenage girl with long dark hair walks down a suburban street in school uniform. Girls play hula hoop in the playground, breathe on a cold window, make foot shapes in condensation, and play lacrosse. Inside, the girls daydream and doze in class, while one girl scratches the back of her ankle with her other foot, and a graphic paper plane flies into a bin. The girls continue to daydream and look bored. At home, her father sips his juice. Jenny attends orchestra practice, where a young boy next to her on violin stares at her, and she waves to an older fresh-faced lad in the violin section. The youngsters tease, and Jenny sighs in frustration. Jenny and the violinist exchange glances as they play. Later, Jenny frowns at the sky as she leaves orchestra practice, stands getting soaked at the bus stop, and a car speeds past, nearly hitting a woman with a pram and a young boy. The car pulls over beside Jenny, and she avoids eye-contact with the handsome driver who gets out, runs around to put the cello in the back seat, and gets back behind the wheel. He drives beside her at walking pace, and she hops into the passenger seat. David changes gear, and they arrive on Jenny's tree-lined street. A large black car overtakes them, and David nods, giving a tight smile. Jenny smiles and gets out of the car. Lying on the floor of her room, Jenny sings along with the record which spins on a small player on the floor. She winces as Graham flounders, resorting to his tea. On another day, Jenny finds a card in a large bouquet of flowers; her father frowns, while her mother smirks as Jenny strides off on the garden path. David crosses the road in front of them. Jenny agonizes, but they shake hands, and she heads back to her friends. They sit awkwardly in the living room, where Jack studies David, who gallantly kisses Marjorie's hand. David and Jenny run through the London rain, up stone steps to the concert venue where men and women pair up and go in. Jenny admires glamorous blonde Helen and touches her fur stole as the pair walk off together, with Helen tapping Jenny playfully on the shoulder. Jenny and David listen with rapt attention to the concert, while Helen looks unimpressed and sleepy, and Danny concentrates serenely. Jenny smiles to herself as she listens. Later, everyone files out of the concert hall, and they walk to the nightclub, where a platinum blonde singer fronts the band.",
    "613": "A flustered man looks down at Elizabeth, then lifts his chin, flutters his eyelids, and steps over her. Alison gives him the A-OK and he walks on. In a staff meeting, his coworkers look on stony-faced. He prods Alison's arm. Clayton rises from his seat at the head of the table and walks out. Alison raises a palm to Sidney. Clayton eats edamame beans and sushi at the desk in his office. He tries to ignore Sidney, who's tapping a notebook with a pen. He nods. Bill's eyes narrow and his expression hardens as a sheepish-looking Sidney sits opposite an indignant Clayton. Sidney's hopeful smile wanes. Clayton stares at Sidney, who furrows his brow and points at the door. Clayton nods and Sidney leaves. Alison reads as models pick outfits from a rack. Sidney plunks himself down beside her and sighs. Alison stares at him, scoffs, stands up, and flounces off with her nose in the air. Sidney makes eye contact with Lawrence and waves. Sidney's nose is taped up like a pig's snout. As Eleanor and Sophie approach, he tears the tape from his face and hides under his desk, then emerges from beneath the table with Sellotape stuck to his left ear. Sidney frowns and obediently toddles off. He fills a plastic container from a water cooler and stares at Sophie, who's cradling Cuba, screwing up his face slightly. Slighted, Eleanor gives him a piercing look and stomps off. His eyebrows twitch as he looks around, and Lawrence and Sophie follow Eleanor from the office. Sidney cautiously opens the door of an office and peers in to see Cuba staring back at him. He tosses the little red ball, which bounces out through an open window, and Cuba scampers after it. Sidney dives for the window and closes it, then smiles and looks up to see a large stone ornament. Sidney's eyes widen at the weighted, polished stone and, horrified, he bites his fist. He calls an elevator, and as she points, they grapple for it. A white paw sticks out as Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence are in reception. Sidney runs off and Alison follows to find Sidney leaning out of a window. He turns minus the bag. She turns to look at Sidney, who shrugs with arms folded. The search party heads off, leaving a relieved Sidney slumped against a wall by the window, as Cuba's nose sticks out of the leather handbag drifting up behind him on the window cleaner's rising platform. Sidney stands in the doorway of Clayton's office, sips whiskey, flings the blue shirts onto a desk, and peers down his nose at them, gesturing with a raised hand. Smiling, Clayton strolls up to him. Sidney leaves, then steps back in.",
    "908": "Purvis sits at the wheel while Anna averts her gaze, and Purvis stares at the helpless informant. She gets out of the car, and Purvis' gaze follows her as she walks around his vehicle. Holding a gun in his pocket, Dillinger peeks around a tree, wearing a straw boater hat and sporting a trimmed mustache. He steps out to meet Piquett, and they sit on a roadside park bench. Piquett reaches into his coat, and Dillinger unfolds the page to reveal a handwritten message that reads, \"I am too well guarded. Two years is not a long time anyway.\" Dillinger folds up the note, stands, and walks away while Piquett puts on his hat and heads off in the opposite direction. Now at a stone wall, Dillinger, Alvin Karpis, and other men look down at an idling steam locomotive as Alvin turns away from Dillinger, who stares ahead. Anna sits at the kitchen table fanning herself with a magazine, and Dillinger enters, crossing the room. Anna's fanning motion slows as her knowing gaze follows him. Dillinger glances around the living room, then returns to the kitchen, goes to the sink, and washes his hands. Anna glances at the door as Polly emerges, and Dillinger dries his hands with the towel and leads the way through the house to the front door. They leave, and our view returns to Anna, who remains at the table, covering her mouth with her hand. Madala crosses the field office to Purvis, who sits on a desk, and Purvis eagerly talks the call. As he listens, Winstead looks up from a newspaper, and Purvis lowers the phone, turning to his peers as the agents gather, with all eyes turning to Winstead. Madala checks a newspaper. Dillinger pulls up to a building with Polly, and they enter the building through a set of double doors, where she goes off, and Dillinger steps forward, casually chewing gum as he glances around. An elevator door opens, and Dillinger steps aboard among a few other men, including a uniformed officer, and he glances at the elevator operator as the door glides shut. He enters the quiet office, passing a row of empty chairs against the wall of a waiting area, with daylight shining in through a window. Dillinger hikes up his pants as he enters the main office, turning to a bulletin board where multiple mug shots of familiar criminals hang posted. He crosses to a desk and holds briefly by a secretary busy typing, and a couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of Dillinger's presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings, seeing a mug shot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses Dillinger's lips as he passes through a brilliant shaft of sunlight.",
    "432": "She looks at Eddie anxiously as she digs in her purse for the coins. She pays, collects her purse and book, and rises to leave. The public address system bleats over the noise of the crowded luncheonette. The waitress leans over and slaps Eddie on the shoulder. He wakes up with a cramped neck. The bar is nearly empty when Eddie comes in. As he looks around the bar, he sees Sarah, alone at a back booth, sipping a highball. She seems amused by their encounter. He takes his drink and joins her at the booth. Sarah nods. There is a long pause as she tries to read his face. Eddie finishes his drink, rises, crosses to the bar, pays the bill, and returns to the booth. As they go out, Sarah stumbles, and he catches her by the arm. Eddie pauses a moment to register this as she limps off, then follows. Eddie goes into the liquor store. Sarah waits outside, stiff and uneasy. Then he comes out with the scotch and they walk off down the street together. They walk slowly, with their eyes pointed straight ahead. He tries to ignore her halting gait. They pass under the awning of the neighborhood's elegant Parisien restaurant. As she searches through her purse for her keys, he reaches out and puts his hand on her shoulder. She closes her eyes, then draws back against the door, fearful, like a threatened animal. He takes her head in his hands and kisses her. She responds but, as he holds her tighter, she starts to struggle. She pushes him away and shakes her head. They stand there for a long moment: she looks away; he looks down at the floor. Then Eddie takes the bag of scotch and places it underneath her arm. He leaves her there in the hall and walks off. A door opens. A hotel manager shows Eddie into a dingy, barely furnished room. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out some bills. Eddie removes his bags from the locker. The sight of the lunch counter reminds him of Sarah. But the lunchroom is empty; only the janitor is there, mopping up. Eddie picks up his bags and goes out. Eddie, on his way back to the hotel, stops at the same liquor store for a bottle. He enters his room, puts down his bags and the liquor, and sits on his rusted brass bed. From his pocket he pulls out the few crumpled bills he has left. He looks at the money, shakes his head disgustedly, and closes his eyes. It is a friendly, neighborhood bar for business people and cocktail drinkers. Eddie walks casually by the pool table and over to the bar.",
    "359": "The boy continues running as one by one the trees transform into tall white pillars. The boy now stands within a vision of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of Minas. A silhouetted figure appears in the distance and moves towards the child. The boy runs to the figure. Arwen watches as the figure holds out its arms, swinging the laughing child into the air. The figure turns to reveal Aragorn, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a Gondorian noble. The child, now in Aragorn's arms, looks directly at Arwen. It is a quiet look filled with infinite sadness. Arwen's eyes drop to the child's chest, where the Evenstar hangs around the child's neck. Arwen realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the child she and Aragorn will never have. Elrond is speaking to his daughter. Arwen shuts her eyes, and when she opens them again, the vision is gone, and she is staring at dark trees once more. Arwen turns towards her companion, who stares at her, concerned. Arwen wheels Asfaloth around, riding away. Arwen's horse gallops over the bridge and through the gates into Rivendell. Elrond is seated alone as Arwen runs up the steps towards him. Elrond stands, stunned, as Arwen, breathing hard, walks towards him with a fierce light in her eyes. Elrond's face is grim. Her father turns away, staring into space as the fight seems to go out of him. He won't look at her, so Arwen gently takes her father's face in her hands and turns him toward her. A hooded figure ascends a curved staircase towards a gallery, stopping before a statue that holds the broken shards of an ancient sword in its arms. The blade, shattering in several fragments as Isildur brandishes Narsil at Sauron. The hooded figure looks up into the sorrowful face of the statue and the figure is revealed to be Arwen. Elrond stares at his daughter, unwavering. A broken sword glows with red heat, its blade in several fragments as a heavy hammer pounds the red-hot blade on an anvil while Elven-smiths temper the steel. Elrond's face is lit by flickering fire as sparks fly in the Rivendell forge. The sword is withdrawn from a pool of steaming water, light shimmering as the water drops slide down the blade of Narsil, the sword that was broken has been remade. Pippin is asleep with Gandalf's protective arm around him as Shadowfax thunders through the night. Shadowfax powers along the countryside, with Pippin huddled in front of Gandalf, the wind sailing through his hair. Shadowfax gallops up onto a low ridge, where before them is the dark mass of Mount Mindolluin, its tall white face whitening in the rising sun. Upon its outthrust knee is the Guarded City: Minas Tirith.",
    "1271": "The dragon rises and breathes fire, then cowers as Griphook shakes a bell. Ron shakes the bell given to him by the goblin, allowing them to ease past the dragon. They continue along a narrow passageway and reach a door, where Griphook presses Bogrod's hand into the locking mechanism, causing Bogrod to grin inanely as the door opens. The dragon belches flame as they enter the vault and close the door. Light appears at the tip of their three wands, revealing a vault filled with treasure, including gold and silver goblets, candlesticks, jewels, and stacks of coins. Harry walks further into the vault, moving ahead of the others, until he stops, turns his head, blinks, and stares up at a gold cup with two handles. Hermione dislodges a ring, which replicates, causing other objects to start replicating. Hermione throws the ring to Harry, who, catching it, wades through the growing mass of treasure. Up to his knees, Harry scrambles over the treasure towards the cup, which has now risen to waist height. Harry stretches the sword high above his head, reaching for the cup, but he disappears from sight, lost in a mountain of gold and silver treasure. The others remain stock-still as he stumbles and drops the cup. Griphook grabs it as Harry tosses him the sword and flings the cup to Hermione. Griphook presses Bogrod's hand against the door, and replicating treasure tumbles out through the open doorway, burying the three inside the vault. Griphook rings the bells to keep the dragon at bay. Harry struggles out of the vault and runs to a balustrade, while Griphook runs off, leaving the grinning Bogrod alone with the dragon, which raises its head and breathes fire, incinerating Bogrod. Armed guards rush in, throwing explosive bursts from their wands, as Hermione destroys the balustrade and, taking a run-up, leaps through the opening onto the dragon's back. Clinging to its spikes, she hauls herself up as the beast belches flame and goblins take cover. Ron and Harry are still by the vault and leap onto the dragon's back. Hermione's spell releases the dragon's chains, and it breathes fire, looking up towards a pinprick of light high above. The three friends cling on desperately as the dragon climbs towards the light, while a guard shoots from an approaching rail cart, which the dragon knocks off the track with its head, causing the cart and its passengers to plummet. All is quiet in the banking hall as rows of tellers pore over ledgers, and above their heads, a chandelier starts to sway. A teller looks up as the dragon bursts through a grating in the floor, causing guards and goblins to flee the flames. The dragon's head hits the chandelier as the three cling on while it bursts its way through a glass dome onto the roof.",
    "784": "Kevin arrives and stares at Jane before starting to sneak off, but George spots him, prompting Kevin to turn and feign surprise as Jane's smile fades. Meanwhile, an aging Volvo speeds through the rainy night with its headlights blazing, swerves alarmingly, and slides backward down a grassy slope, narrowly missing a tree. It comes to a halt, leaving the occupants frozen in shock, and as the tires spin in the wet ground, they stick their cell phones out the windows, trying to get a signal while not looking at each other. Kevin and Jane arrive soaking wet at a bar, where Jane checks the public telephone but indicates with a roll of her eyes that it's not working, so they head to the bar. Kevin flops onto a barstool, and two empty glasses hit the bar as Jane grins at him and gawks, causing Kevin to be taken aback. They grin tipsily as the locals enjoy their goofy performance, urging them on as they dance on the bar with Jane barefoot and Kevin coming up with wacky dance moves. Kevin jumps down, leaving Jane dancing wildly to the crowd's delight, then helps her down as she lurches drunkenly, and he stops her from falling. They stare into each other's eyes, and Jane kisses him hard and passionately. They continue kissing in the Volvo, tearing off each other's soaking wet clothes. The next day, Kevin strolls down the grassy slope with two coffees, while the early sun reflects off the car windows, and Jane is still asleep in the mud-spattered vehicle. He looks around nonchalantly before they go to a diner. Kevin's expression freezes as Jane crumples up a paper, throws it at him, and leaves, staring at him with bitter disappointment before turning on her heel and leaving. Kevin walks back to the diner with his face in his hands and later strides into the newspaper offices to approach Maureen, leaving angry and frustrated. Jane arrives at her apartment, overturns a chair, throws the phone, screws up the paper, stomps on it, and sits staring miserably into space. At the office, she picks up her messages, runs her hands through her shoulder-length hair, and throws her arms defensively. Casey comes in, and they exchange a worried look before Jane walks slowly toward George's office, where he places a caring hand on her shoulder to escort her out. Tess is at the bridal shop, and Jane is puzzled as she walks over to Tess looking horrified, while Tess looks puzzled as Jane walks out. Tess pouts and flounces back to her fitting room, tripping over her hem as lights begin to decorate the evening cityscape and a taxi drops Jane off at the restaurant where guests are gathering for the engagement party.",
    "1378": "Harry sees something shining in the distance and moves towards it as Viktor tries to zap him but misses, and then Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand and points his wand at Viktor's body as if to finish him off. Harry runs up and intervenes, and they struggle before the two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground, causing Harry to look back and see Cedric is pinned down with no means of escape. Harry zaps the plant life, helping Cedric wriggle free, and then assists him up. The wind starts blowing again, and Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard. Harry lets out a shout and holds his head in pain, as Wormtail and Voldemort appear nearby. Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric, leaving Cedric dead on the ground. Wormtail pulls Harry closer and a statue grabs hold of Harry, trapping him. Wormtail drops something into a cauldron as Harry watches, and a bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, dropping into the cauldron. Wormtail slashes his arm over the cauldron, and then takes the knife to Harry, cutting at his arm, prompting Harry to shout. Wormtail lets the drops fall into the cauldron, which bursts into flame, and a reformed Voldemort emerges. Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply, looking concerned but doing it anyway, before Voldemort sticks the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes as others are summoned, and Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures before granting Wormtail a new hand. As Harry struggles to get free, Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head, making him scream, and then forces Harry to bow with magic, casting at him so he wriggles in pain. Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, and as Harry begins to move away, he takes steps toward Voldemort. They both cast and their streams of magic meet, and they struggle as shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. The connection breaks and Harry runs over to Cedric's body, summoning the cup over to them, and in an instant they port out. Voldemort looks angry as Harry appears with Cedric's body back at the arena, where Harry weeps on Cedric's body as Amos breaks down wailing and the crowd looks on distraught. Mad-Eye Moody enters, closing the door behind him while Harry is still sobbing in the room. They sit, and Harry nods as we see his arm marked with a skull and snake. Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, reaching for his empty bottle before rushing to a chest with other bottles, struggling to find one. A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.",
    "715": "He snaps his fingers and points to the car, then yanks open the car door, revealing empty seats. Smiling, Rose and Jack run onto the forward well deck. Rose places her hand on Jack's lips and gazes at him. They kiss. Standing at the bridge rail, Murdoch glances down at them, smiles, and walks off. Watching from the crow's nest, another man, Fleet, looks down and taps his comrade, Lee, on the arm. They stare down at Jack and Rose. The men turn and gaze past the ship. Their eyes widen as a large iceberg looms, straight ahead. Fleet rings the lookout bell three times and grabs a telephone, which rings on the bridge. The quartermaster at the wheel glances back at the phone. Officer Moody steps onto the bridge and answers the phone. Moody hangs up and turns to Murdoch as he runs to the bridge door. Quartermaster Hichens turns the wheel to the left. Murdoch rushes over to the engine room telegraph and shifts the handle to full speed astern. Hichens turns the wheel quickly. In the engine room, the chief engineer spots the telegraph shift and drops a pot of steaming soup. He turns the wheel until it stops. Murdoch hurries to the bridge rail and peers at the iceberg. In the engine room, an engineer yells. Other engineers scurry around. A red warning light flashes. Engineers slam the furnace dampers shut. Underwater, the ship's main propeller slows. An engineer pulls down a thick lever. All the propellers stop. An officer pushes an engineer out of the way and turns a wheel quickly to the right. The propellers spin in the opposite direction. In the crow's nest, the men stare at the iceberg as the ship heads straight toward it. Murdoch stares at the iceberg. Nearing the iceberg, the ship veers slowly to the left. The ship's propellers turn and reverse. Sweat trickles down Murdoch's temples. The ship's bow shifts to the left of the iceberg. At the bow railing, a man runs toward it. The ship scrapes along the side of the ice. Jack and Rose stop kissing as the ship trembles. On the bridge deck, Murdoch glances down at his hands, resting on the shaking rail. Above, Fleet holds onto the rim of the crow's nest, while Lee sits on the floor. In the bridge, Hichens keeps the wheel turned hard left. Below deck, Fabrizio sits up in his bunk. In the cargo hold, water shoots through a long tear in the hull. In the cabin, Andrews sits at his desk. He glances up at the trembling crystal chandelier above. In the crow's nest, Fleet and Lee gaze at the iceberg. On the bridge, Hichens turns the wheel to the right.",
    "172": "He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest. Bo Catlett notices this. Bo Catlett eyes him a beat, then pushes out of his chair. Bo Catlett nods, gets up. Ronnie sits up straight. Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt. Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look. Bo Catlett glances once more at Chili then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him. Chili looks at Harry. Chili shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, fumbles for his cigarettes. Chili's minivan is parked out front. Obviously losing it now, rubs his eyes and quickly walks off to a row of payphones. Chili sits at the desk on the phone. They consider each other a moment until Chili finally checks his watch. Karen looks caught, doesn't answer right away. Chili lets that sink in a minute. Leo sits down in the armchair, stares sadly at the briefcase. Leo nods. He picks up the briefcase as he rises from the sofa and Leo gets out of his chair. Chili reaches for the door, opens it and looks back at Leo. As Chili starts for the elevator. Chili drives a dark road up into the park. Chili pulls in behind a row of trailers. He gets out of the car and heads for the set where Harry is now looking up at the sky and yelling at someone. He rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead as we come upon. As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut. Leo steps into his doorway. Chili shakes his head, starts back for the elevator. Chili stops, turns around. Chili says nothing, sits down in one of the red leather chairs. Bo Catlett smiles at him, doesn't give up the script. Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script, begins flipping through it. Chili flips through the script, sees a name. Karen smiles, decides to wait a moment. Chili, lost in the movie, keeps mouthing the dialogue. As Tanya/Marlene Dietrich resumes her slow walk away, Karen sits down at the end of the row. People start getting up to leave. Chili turns to a guy a few seats away from him. The guy gives Chili a look, puts his arm around his date, and quickly starts up the aisle so that Chili can now see Karen sitting there at the end of the row. She gets up, they start up the aisle together. As Karen and Chili exit the theater, stand there a moment.",
    "831": "He goes inside, where Nick and Kurt are playing video games. The next night, a laid-back Nick strolls along a walkway at a Travel Inn. Clean-shaven with short dark brown hair, he wears jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He comes to a room and knocks gently on the door, which Dale answers, leaving the security chain fastened. Nick grabbed him. Dale and Kurt run to the window and see a man dressed in black get out of a black muscle car, and Kurt and Dale share an excited look and clench their fists. Kurt pauses to compose himself, then opens the door and speaks as a sharp-suited man wearing dark glasses enters the room, takes off his shades, and throws a plastic sheet down. The guys are in Kurt's car as they drive into a rough neighborhood and near a bar. They enter the bustling bar filled with a shady clientele. Kurt nods to a musclebound guy as they head to the bar, to a Latino, and finally to the heavyset black barman, who bridles. A guy eyes them as they leave—the same guy from inside. They follow the black guy, who has a shaven head and several tattoos. Jones glares at them as Harken smashes his office wall down with a sledgehammer. With his extended office now complete, Harken removes a strip of clear plastic from a plaque on the door and buffs it with his sleeve. Nick glowers and then withdraws money from his bank account. Meanwhile, balding Bobby Pellitt is partying hard with three Thai hookers in skimpy underwear, snorting a line of cocaine from one's stomach as they writhe in orgiastic abandonment. He's in his office while Kurt's in the main office and frowns as Bobby's bare torso presses up against the window. At home, Kurt raids a private stash of money. In the main office, Bobby looks over at Kurt, gives him the finger, and smooches with one of the women as Kurt frowns. Bobby's shirt is open, exposing his bloated stomach, and he holds up Hank's handicapped parking pass. At the dentist, Julia licks the back of Dale's neck, then sucks his left earlobe and jams her tongue in his ear. Dale furrows his brow as she tweaks his nipples, then grins and slaps his ass. Wearing a black hoodie and dark glasses, Dale withdraws money from a cash point in a gas station mini-mart. Later, the guys sit opposite Jones at a table in a dingy bar, pushing a large briefcase towards him. Jones opens it to find it empty apart from a small bundle of bank notes, snaps it shut, sips his drink, and beckons them closer. They lean forward as he reaches inside his jacket.",
    "322": "Aragorn warily approaches Boromir, who is motionless and stares at the ring as if transfixed, seemingly growing in stature as if absorbing its power. Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair, and Aragorn unhands his sword. Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, there is a vista of industry with hundreds of Orcs and writhing birthsacks flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden gantry. The Fellowship is struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the Pass of Caradhras, while Legolas the Elf moves lightly across the top of the snow, suddenly pausing. Merry and Pippin shiver in Boromir's arms, and Frodo meets Gandalf's eye, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. The Fellowship is walking along the far shore of a dark lake directly below great looming cliffs, where the footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees, and slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. A large moon rises over the mountains as the lines grow broader and clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. Gandalf raises his arms and eyebrows, and with that, the rock face silently divides in the middle, and two great doors swing outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enters the blackness, something in the water stirs. They step warily into the darkness of Moria, a dank cavern with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. A glow from Gandalf's staff suddenly lights the chamber, and the Fellowship recoils in horror as many dwarf skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle, with rusting armor and shields peppered with arrows and axes. The Fellowship draws swords and backs away towards the entrance, but Frodo is suddenly pulled to the ground by a long sinuous tentacle wrapped around his ankle, dragging him towards the lake. Frodo cries out, and Aragorn and Boromir rush forward. Aragorn severs the tentacle holding Frodo and pulls him to safety, while Boromir hacks at the other writhing limbs. Twenty more tentacles ripple out of the lake as the dark water boils and the hideous beast lashes out at the Fellowship. Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, flinging Frodo in the air as the Fellowship battles the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle, releasing Frodo, who falls into Boromir's arms. Legolas shoots an arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo. The Fellowship hurriedly backs away from the creature, retreating into the Moria chamber as many coiling arms seize the large doors. With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the cliff face.",
    "834": "Nick watches from his car as Bobby jumps around by the window in silk pajamas, flailing a pair of nunchucks, and after considering for a moment, Dale sneaks through Harken's house carrying a jar of peanuts. He puts a light on in the bedroom, goes to the door of the on-suite bathroom, opens it, and a cat leaps out at him. He falls against the shower, picks up a bottle of shampoo, and his eyes move between the shampoo and the peanuts. Nick sees Bobby's bedroom lights go out, heaves a sigh, looks at his box of Rat Attack, and answers his phone. Bobby answers the door to Harken, who hands him his phone and shoots him in the chest. Nick ducks down in his car as Harken flees the scene in his 4x4, yanks his seatbelt but it won't budge, and panicking, Dale tidies Harken's shower soaps and legs it with the peanuts. A speed camera snaps a picture of Nick as he hurtles through a red light, and the guys meet in a bar before getting in Nick's car, only to have a squad car block them in. A black officer strolls over, taps on Nick's window, and peers in, leading to them being in the back of the cop car at the precinct where Dale, Kurt, and the two detectives stare at Nick, who frowns while Kurt's face drops as he recalls scrubbing his backside with Bobby's toothbrush. The guys find Jones drinking in the bar, and after Jones cocks an eyebrow and shoots them a look, they huddle closer as Jones smirks and sips his drink. They then ride in Kurt's car to Harken's house, sneak in, and Kurt squats by Rhonda, who smiles at him before Harken enters and stomps out of the room. Kurt heads for Rhonda, and as Kurt emerges from the bathroom with Rhonda close behind, Nick and Dale are in the car with cops nearby. Kurt drives off, and Harken rams them in his SUV twice, causing them to weave around a car. Julia is naked in a bath and masturbates, while Kurt accelerates, swerves wildly through traffic, and hangs a sharp left into an empty street. Harken smashes into them in his 4x4, setting off the airbags, and taps on the window with his revolver, which Kurt lowers. They get out, Harken holds them at gunpoint and then shoots himself, sinking to the floor and clutching his leg, as Dale tosses the gun down. The guys high-five, and as Harken goes for Kurt, Nick smacks him hard in the face, knocking him to the ground. Luke smirks, pats her, and she pulls the patient's trousers down.",
    "258": "At the same time, the little Cashier emerges from the 7-Eleven with his gun, and the two begin to shoot at Hi's retreating figure, with the Policeman's revolver popping and the Cashier's Magnum booming. Hi is huffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies as the cop car careens onto the street in the background, its siren wailing. The PASSENGER COP leans far out his window, one hand gripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun at Hi, shooting away, as bullets whizz past. Suddenly, the Huggies box pops forward out from under Hi's arm, hit by a bullet with a soft pthunk! Still running, Hi reaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it, tips it, and loses it. He overruns it a couple of steps before bringing himself up short, turns to pick up the box, but PING-PING, bullets chew up the road near his hand. Leaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured yard as the police car proceeds down the street to catch him around the corner, with the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker. Tracking behind Hi, he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door, runs through the living room where a middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV and looks up as Hi rushes by, then plunges down a staircase, and as he does so, we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock. He emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping-pong and runs out the back door, followed by OFFICER STEENSMA, who plunges down the stairs. Outdoors now, Hi runs, crosses the street behind the house, and enters the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side, as a pack of dogs thunders in with the lead Doberman and about a dozen neighborhood dogs. The dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs as Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something, he turns up one of the last lanes, races along it, and grabs a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run. He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end, and he fires. Hi keeps running as the Policeman runs along the front aisle, keeping pace with Hi running along the back aisle, squeezing off shots at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity. Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the Policeman.",
    "252": "Butch pulls on his tee-shirt, and Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement as he looks at her license. We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside, then hangs up the phone. Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill, causing Esmarelda's eyes to light up. She goes to take it, but Butch holds it for some time before giving her the bill. Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again, and climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind. When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk. Fabienne rolls over, and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss, and Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch. Fabienne reacts, lies her head back, and Butch continues to massage her crotch. Butch kisses her on the mouth and then his head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame; she finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head, handing him a towel as Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth while Butch keeps on talking from the other room. Fabienne brushes her teeth, and as we watch her for a moment or two, she remembers something. She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed. She looks at him for a moment as Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. Fabienne enters the room, laughs, and gives Butch a sweet long kiss. Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought. Butch is finished dressing as he goes through the suitcase. By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase, throwing clothes. Fabienne can hardly speak, as she’s never seen Butch this way. Fabienne is crying and scared. Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing, and he bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor, then rises as Fabienne is still sniffling. Butch goes to the closet, puts on his high school jacket, and rises from the floor. The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as its little engine will take it. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. Everything seems normal, more or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place, basically looking like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.",
    "1298": "Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood, while Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof, keeping a hand on his nephew as Morgan raises the monitor above his head. There's movement right next to him, causing Graham to spin and aim the flashlight at the crops to his right, but the light only penetrates a few feet into the crops. Graham holds his breath, turns, and drops the flashlight at the same time, causing the beam of light to turn off when the flashlight hits the ground. Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness, searching with his hands over the ground in all directions until they finally touch the flashlight. He tries to get up but stumbles backward into the crops, tangled as he struggles to rise. He gets up and starts running, with leaves and stalks slapping him from all directions and something coming behind. Graham makes a sudden right turn, putting his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes, then makes another sudden turn left, and keeps running across the yard until he steps into the kitchen. His hair is messed and his shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it, but the children don't notice his presence. Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat as the children splash each other at the sink while cleaning the dinner dishes. His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind, his breathing a slow controlled pant. The children stop playing and look up to Graham, following his stare to the kitchen table until Graham looks up at them. Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the television stand, grabs one, and Bo snatches it as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR. Morgan stares at his sister, while Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa with the same dazed, slow movements. Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically, finds one, and reaches for the VCR, breathing heavily and wheezing. He moves to the sofa and takes a seat between his father and his uncle, as Bo walks over and squeezes in also. The four of them stare at the television as Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales. The family room lights are off now, with a couple of glasses of Bo's water on the television. Bo is asleep on Graham's shoulder, and Morgan is asleep on Merrill's lap, while Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill, who looks his brother in the eyes and then at the TV screen.",
    "744": "A petite black woman with long plaits comes towards Skeeter, passing beneath the long, wispy branches of the willow. The black woman, Constantine, smiles at her warmly as she sits down next to her. Constantine grips Skeeter by the hand, bringing a grateful smile to her face, and Skeeter nods with tears in her eyes. They walk out of the willow glade, and Constantine slaps an arm around Skeeter's shoulders. Skeeter walks back the same way she came, with a more relaxed pace and a thoughtful look on her face. Later, she is on the phone, and Charlotte has traced the phone flex to the kitchen. Elegant, slim Ms. Elaine Stein is still on the phone, and Skeeter replaces the receiver, grinning as if she'd just won the jackpot. Meanwhile, Hilly is on Elizabeth's back porch with a contractor. Aibileen glances up at a windy sky. Skeeter waits for Hilly to drive away and then looks pointedly at Aibileen, who hurries in with the laundry basket. They come into Elizabeth's kitchen, and Elizabeth's husband, Raleigh, sees Skeeter sitting with Aibileen. Aibileen gets up from sorting the washing, and black storm clouds release heavy rain on Jackson. At Hilly's house, Minnie is fanning Mrs. Walters with a newspaper. She and Minnie glance towards the window and the storm raging outside. Mrs. Walters sits up in her chair, in awe, and fixes Minnie with a look of confused comprehension. Hilly, who has been lighting candles on the dining table, sits fanning herself. Minnie puts down the paper and sidles to the window, looking out over the terrace and the outdoor toilet beyond it. She sees a sun chair being buffeted in the wind, shifts awkwardly from foot to foot, and the pool umbrella has gone the way of the chair. Minnie beats a hasty retreat, and Mrs. Walters lays out some cards. Her daughter's eyes narrow as she watches Minnie disappear down the hall. In the bathroom, as Minnie softly raises the toilet lid, Hilly puts her ear to the bathroom door. Minnie, caught with her knickers down, freezes, but then defiantly flushes the toilet. Minnie stands with her arms folded, then slams down the lid. Mrs. Walters looks up from her cards without expression. Minnie, carrying her handbag, strides out of the front door into the pouring rain. A child's bedroom is turned upside down, and Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley on her lap, sheltering under an upturned mattress. In Elizabeth's sprawling bungalow the next day, Aibileen, in her maid's uniform, is sitting on the toilet. Flies buzz around her; she brings a hand to her mouth, her face perspiring, her expression world-weary. Elizabeth, holding Mae Mobley's hand, stands outside the wooden toilet on the back porch, and Aibileen picks the child up. Aibileen shuts the toilet door with her free hand.",
    "454": "As the scene freezes with Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence, the Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him, and on these words, as we saw before, Buttercup emerges. The crowd suddenly goes to its knees, wave after wave of silent kneeling people, all of them down. Buttercup is touched as before but then seems stunned as she advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. Buttercup comes out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom, and as she frantically grabs a robe, she starts to run. She bursts into the Prince's chambers where Count Rugen stands nearby, just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk, and she nods. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. Humperdinck and Rugen walk into the grove of trees, deeper into the grove now as Rugen searches around. Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. Count Rugen drags Westley up alongside the thing—levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. Westley has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself, and then opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going. Westley is lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. It keeps on coming as we finally see he switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, and sits in a chair. Westley is in anguish so deep it is dizzying, and helpless, he cries. Count Rugen watches the tears, then starts to write in his quarters, swamped, with piles of papers strewn all over. Now Yellin, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man, appears in the doorway, entering. The Prince and Yellin turn to her in the doorway as she glides out. A lot of hollering is going on as the thieves are being rounded up by the Brute Squad, a large group of large men, with Yellin standing on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling, and his wagon starts, and as it does, Inigo, drunk as a skunk, sprawls in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He looks dreadful, unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. Inigo feels a hand on his back and compares it to his own smaller hand, and as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, Fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch.",
    "491": "After a second, he enters. Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a female teacher kneels next to him and makes final adjustments. Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham, who looks around the room and then directly at Cole. The female teacher looks to Cole and nods. The group of villagers on the stage laugh and mock. Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume and hops around, clearly embarrassed. He smiles a true friend's smile. Cole hesitates, and it takes him a moment before he steps forward. Cole steps up to the stone, places his hand around the handle, and begins to pull. The sword starts to come out, and Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his head. Merlin and everyone on stage bow. Malcolm watches his client standing unafraid in the spotlight for the first time. The villagers rise and rush to Cole, scooping him up and carrying him around the stage in celebration. Cole chuckles and then starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try unsuccessfully to keep him up. They slowly sag and collapse, with all the students laughing as they try to untangle themselves. Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable among a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying themselves on stage. The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass window. Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby, and Cole walks back and forth in front of him, still holding the sword from the play. Cole glances at Malcolm, who exhales very slowly as he gets up. Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance. Lynn glances over to Cole, who sits in his seat silently. The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill. Cole takes a long time. Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights, looks over slowly, and eyes Cole. Lynn becomes upset and nods with grave understanding. Cole watches her, and Lynn's eyes move to Cole. Cole gazes at her intense expression and smiles a tiny smile. Lynn glances down and drowns in her thoughts. Lynn looks up sharply and becomes still, her face unreadable. Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's, and she brings her hands to her mouth, beginning to cry. Lynn covers her face with her hands, and the tears roll out through her fingers. Lynn looks at her son, barely getting the words out, and Cole moves closer to Lynn. She cradles him in her arms, and mother and son hold each other tight. Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home, enters the living room, and smiles at what he sees.",
    "1075": "Nullah notices and drops in after her, and she eyes him coldly. He studies her and smiles as the Drover rides up while they pull away, in the tank. Nullah brings Daisy to the surface, and as the truck drives away down the dusty road, Drover hauls Daisy's body from the tank. Sarah sprints over, and Nullah desperately hugs his mother while Drover hangs his head as Nullah clings to the body. Bandy runs out of the house, and the cop's truck continues down the long, straight, dusty road into the vast scrub lands of Faraway Downs. The windmill turns slowly at sunset as Sarah looks tearfully out towards Daisy's blazing funeral pyre. Smoke drifts from the top of a rocky summit nearby, and Magarri signals to the hilltop, waving to King George who starts to chant. The body is carried towards the fire, with the old man looking down on the homestead from his hilltop in the soft glow of dawn. Sarah steps out of the house as Drover sits down on the fence and lights a cigarette. She looks distraught, and he frowns as she avoids his gaze. She walks to where Nullah is grieving, lying curled up on the ground on a mattress, while she's completely at a loss. She crouches down next to him, laying newspapers from a pile on the ground to kneel on, as she kneels and thinks, with the nearest front page having an advert for a film. He looks up and sees the smoke on the hilltop while she looks perplexed, and he holds up his hand with a cloth tied around it as she's not sure how to proceed. He watches her expectantly as she finishes with a self-deprecating flourish, and her eyes fill with tears in the blazing sun. Sarah faces Drover in the saddle, and Nullah looks up as a twister starts to form in the dust in front of the house. He looks unconvinced while Flynn salutes and eyeballs Sarah, and Bandy and Flynn nod as Sing Song winks and Nullah grins. Sing Song's chop wagon moves on as Drover opens the gate to the cattle pen, and Drover marshals his motley gang of riders as the huge herd moves out of the pen, raising a massive cloud of dust. The army of cattle moves off, while King George follows their progress from his rocky mountain top. The herd approaches a wide river as Drover and Sarah ride ahead of the cattle, and the others ride behind and alongside, keeping them together. Sing Song drives his wagon into the water, and the crossing is successful. Crowds fill an open-air cinema in nighttime Darwin as Carney stares grimly and drops a curtain down between himself and Fletcher, who turns angrily away. The drive moves on through the soft light of sunset, approaching a range of jagged vertical cliffs.",
    "921": "He flips a dangling leg back into the lift as the doors close and intercepts M, then vaults a balustrade into the balcony above the lobby, avoiding the squads of agents looking for him. He is back past M, and she gives a half smile as Bond leaves the building. In a dingy building, two men are carrying a heavy box downstairs. In an office, Felix swigs from a bottle and puffs on his cigar as Bond hangs up. In a rundown part of town, men are drinking, smoking, and playing games in a bar. Felix walks in to join Bond who is at the bar, while a guy in a leather jacket walks to the bar and a soldier in armor is present. He sprints upstairs and takes out a waiting soldier with an elbow to the face. Another opens up, sprints off, and jumps from one building to another as Felix observes the chaos dispassionately and sips his beer. Beam looks concerned as Felix gets in the car, and Bond emerges from the shadows of a balcony onto the rundown street. The sun blazes down on a rocky desert, and the general, police chief, and guard sit on a cool balcony surveying the arid scene. The general leers after the slim hostess, and the police chief wags a knowing finger at him. Behind a rock overlooking the geometrically laid out compound, Camille expertly assembles and loads an automatic as two cars approach. She stares at him, then looks coldly at him to an underground entrance. Parties converge along metal walkways and staircases and arrive at a meeting area surrounded by clear glass panels where there is a display of shiny metallic balls nearby. Greene's party arrives, his grim-faced driver carrying two metal attache cases, and Greene grins at the general. The hostess brings the general's beer, removes the beer, a document is placed on the table, and Greene slides it over to the general with a pen. Camille vaults over the edge of the compound's main building and drops onto the balcony. The general eyes Greene grimly and grabs the paper as the second case is placed in front of him. He opens it and examines the wads of banknotes inside, then leaves the table as Greene and his men grin smugly. Inside the building, Camille is heading in their direction and hides in a doorway as the general and his bodyguard approach. She composes herself as the police chief heads downstairs to his four by four and dumps the money on the backseat. The general's men stand guard at his suite as Greene's party heads for the car park. Camille rips her clothes, breathes deeply, and drops onto the police chief's car, where he shoots the chief in the head and clings to the bumper as the driver reverses.",
    "139": "Gandhi has remained seated, pensive, while Charlie studies him for a moment. A little grin appears on Gandhi's face, but his mood stays pensive and remote. Gandhi looks up with anger and determination, which is then broken by a hopeless sigh, leaving Charlie stunned and obviously hurt. Gandhi proceeds more gently, and now Charlie understands. Gandhi smiles, showing warmth and sadness, then speaks with determined purposefulness and a friend's trust. He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie. He nods, meeting Charlie's eyes with a smile that shelters his vulnerability and returns his love. The very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain his emotions. The courtroom is packed to overflowing and restless as Gandhi sits in the dock. The English magistrate surveys the courtroom and signals his English clerk to him. The magistrate frowns, seeing the front row from his point of view with two or three Indian journalists and one European, which he receives with some alarm, and he indicates that the clerk take his place. Gandhi stands, and the courtroom is silent, but the sound of chanting outside is still audible. The magistrate stares as the journalists write and the clerk swallows. The magistrate is only too aware of the mob outside as he looks around the courtroom. The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches the distant wall, the top of his desk, and his twitching hands for an answer, then stares again, along with the journalists. The magistrate wets his lips, and the court explodes into chaos with cheering and delight. The magistrate rises, looks around the room, and heads for his chambers as the journalists scribble furiously. Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom, steps down from the courtroom to the balcony, and a huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below. As he smiles down at them, he is turned by surprise and caution, followed by even more caution on hearing something that sounds casually ironic but is determined, even angry. Inside, the Governor, Sir Edward Gait, with a portrait of the King prominent behind him, feels cornered for different reasons while the desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of identically covered folders and some folded newspapers on one corner. He taps one of the folders irritably with his hand as Sir George looks at him, half defensive and half defiant. They are old friends from the same school and social class who have been together a long time in India, arguing as friends who accept the same premises, although the Governor feels the game has not been played quite fairly.",
    "97": "A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, recuperating. Forrest turns the TV off and is hit on the back of the head by a ping-pong ball, so he shakes his head. The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle, and they step toward the ping-pong table. The player holds the ball up and moves it back and forth as Forrest keeps his eyes on the ball. The player tosses the ball down onto the table, and Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other player. Forrest hits ping-pong balls that land in a bedpan positioned on a chair as a group of wounded soldiers sit and watch him play by himself. Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side of the table while Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep, then a hand reaches and grabs him. Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, holds him down, looks at him, lets go, and rolls away. Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him, and later Forrest plays ping-pong by himself when an officer walks up to him, holding up an envelope. Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed and stops in mid-sentence as he looks down to see a heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lying there. Forrest turns and looks at the nurse. The television reveals Forrest being awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson, with color footage showing President Johnson placing the award around Forrest's neck, shaking his hand, leaning, and whispering into Forrest's ear. The television then shows Forrest dropping his pants, bending over, and showing the bullet wound on his bare buttocks as President Johnson looks down and smiles. Three men in a barber shop look up in disbelief, and Mrs. Gump looks up in shock. Hilary leads a line of vets toward a large anti-Vietnam War rally and pulls Forrest up onto the stage; the other vets follow and push Forrest toward the microphones. Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly, and Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman sneaks over to the audio circuit board and pulls the patch cords out, so Forrest continues to speak into the microphone even though no one can hear him. Hilary notices the policeman, rushes over to the audio board, pushes the policeman away, and grabs his nightstick. Another protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away as Isabel, Hilary, and another protester try to plug the tangled mess of wires back into the audio board.",
    "1008": "The others stare ahead, dazed and incapable of movement, as one man wipes tears from his eyes. Another man approaches the front of Buckingham Palace and places a bouquet of flowers at the gate, and more people arrive with bouquets of flowers to place at the railings. Tony and Alistair watch Earl Spencer read a statement on TV when a woman enters. A smiling Alistair puts down the phone, and the woman hands Tony another phone. Tony's hand covers the receiver as he waits a moment, then raises the phone to speak. As a servant arranges cutlery on a table, Robin enters the dining room. The Queen strides down a corridor with stags' heads mounted on the walls, and two maids stand aside to let her pass. In the study, the Queen picks up a phone from a desk and sits behind the desk. Cherie enters the room behind Tony, and Prince Phillip enters the study wearing a kilt. Tony sits on a sofa while Cherie stands close by; he puts the phone down, and Cherie moves around and catches his attention. The Queen and the Queen Mother, dressed in black, walk to a nearby car while the Royal Family staff watch the broadcast, and Robin stares impassively at Tony's image on the TV. Charles, accompanied by Stephen and various men, walks through a vast lobby with high ceilings and huge windows, then strides down a corridor and suddenly stops outside a room, pausing for a moment before entering. Charles slowly enters the room, and a glass door shuts behind him. He stands before a casket, waits a moment, then walks around to the head of the casket. Seen from outside the room, Charles's view is obscured by the frame of the glass door, and a priest can be glimpsed speaking while Charles has his hand over his mouth, looking in grief at the casket. Later, Tony sits in the backseat of a car driving down a motorway at daytime, hands the phone to his female assistant, then glances out the window. Charles descends from a plane down some stairs, shakes hands with Lord Airlie on the runway, and walks over to meet various uniformed men standing nearby. A line of soldiers carries a casket above their heads, and Charles approaches Tony; they both look at the soldiers with the casket. Nelson Mandela appears on TV while the Queen fiddles with her pearl necklace, and Phillip picks his fingernails while the Queen scratches her wrist. At nighttime, two Range Rovers pull into the courtyard at Balmoral, and the Queen looks at the vehicles from an upstairs window. She watches as two men exit from the lead vehicle, then turns away from the window.",
    "1358": "Izzy opens another car hood and sees pieces missing. As Jack heads back to his car, three residents walk with him, ad lib, but he stops when he notices four military trucks driving past slowly, with antennas atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area, which disturbs him. Meanwhile, Joe rides along a hillside, parks his bike, and walks toward the edge, moving into the doorway where his dad and others convene. Joe hears something, drops his flashlight, and the men all turn silent, putting Joe on the spot. Later, Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room while watching \"In Search Of\" and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie. In the middle of nowhere, a wooded area sees an Ohio Power cherry picker truck drive up and park beside a utility pole. Rooney, 49, with a cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a weathered clipboard, glances at the power line, and doesn't understand what he sees as we push in on him. He radios in. At a loud town meeting, two hundred frustrated citizens crowd the auditorium. Jack is at the podium with town officials, including the local mayor, sitting on stage as Mrs. Babbit, 52, speaks into the microphone on the floor. The town roars its approval, and Jack tries as the town erupts in agreement. A short, bald man of 65, Mr. McCandless, speaks, and the mayor takes over as Jack has a sidebar meeting with someone and continues into the office. We dolly fast with an exasperated Jack as he writes, tailed by someone, heading for his office, where he sees Louis being escorted out by an officer across the room. Louis heads out, and Jack holds on as he turns and enters his office. As that door opens, we cut to the door of Joe's messy, motherless room opening as Joe and Alice enter. Joe could not be more self-conscious as he moves stacks of comics, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed, and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. Alice looks around as she enters and sits on the bed. Joe takes the five-car train model, and Alice moves close, holding it as Joe watches her. She really looks at it, but their tension is interrupted by an out-of-breath Charles. Jack is with Officer Tally, 24, who puts a map on his desk showing 28 dots in a circle, anywhere from a 20 to 150-mile radius, with Lillian at the center, stunning Jack. Officer Rosko is at his desk with a young woman and a ham radio beside a reel-to-reel tape deck, taking notes. Cary is behind the camera, with Charles beside him, as we see Alice behind the camera, watching Joe and smiling.",
    "980": "He stares at her for a moment then lets go of the screen door and purposefully walks across the porch to embrace her. She flings her arms around him with a big smile. They sit indoors. She leaves. Daisy leans across the dining table. Benjamin carries two of Daisy's suitcases as they walk side by side through the silent shadowy corridors of the home. They enter a bedroom decorated with framed landscape paintings. Daisy puts her coat and hand back down on the double bed which has tall elaborately-carved bedposts. She closes the door and turns around. Their eyes meet across the dimly-lit room. Stepped closer and Benjamin firmly clasps her torso. Daisy arches her back slightly as their lips meet in a slow kiss. Benjamin unfastens her belt then unzips the back of her dress. She carefully rolls down her stocking, revealing a scar beneath her right knee. He slides off her dress and kisses the back of her neck. Her hand meets his as he grasps her right thigh. She turns to kiss him. Her long sleek red hair draped over one shoulder. Benjamin pulls his sweater off and climbs onto the bed as Daisy reclines, wearing a sultry black slip. A clock ticked from Queenie's old dresser. Benjamin and Daisy are silhouetted against the lilac sunset on the slowly drifting boat, the Bottomup. Benjamin looks up to see a space rocket rise over billowing mountainous clouds on the horizon. Daisy wrings out her wet hair. Benjamin playfully engulfs her in a stripy towel. They lounged together beneath palm trees on golden sands. Standing beside her on the ocean, Benjamin watches Daisy as she raises her head from the still waters. Night, they make love on the deck. They dive off the prowl of the boat as moonlight plays on the glittering surface of the sea. They swim gracefully beneath a brilliant full moon. They remained seated at the picnic branch as people flee from an advancing storm. They lie on the floor close to bed. He lies face down with his eyes closed. Daisy rests her chin against his shoulder. Lightning flashes. The wind rattles the windows. The doors rattle in the gale. Pale diaphanous drapes and close them in their bed. Daisy rolls onto her side and smiles as she gazes at him. He props himself up and looks at her. She strokes his cheek. He smiles. He inches closer. They kiss. A ceiling fan turns beneath the slipping raft over their bed. In the hospital, Caroline stares down at the diary. Looking tanned and healthy, Benjamin and Daisy carry luggage up the front steps of the retirement home. Benjamin enters ahead of Daisy to find it deserted.",
    "355": "Frodo materializes as he drops to his knees, clutching his bleeding hand, and screams. The fires below roar in anger, red light blazes, and the cavern is filled with a great glare and heat. Legolas sees Aragorn fall to the ground as Gollum triumphantly holds the ring aloft, dancing gleefully, perilously close to the edge of the chasm. Aragorn turns to see huge troll feet moving closer, and Legolas races toward him. Gollum remains triumphant on the edge of the precipice, with the fiery lava casting an evil light. Frodo rises slowly, his eyes lock on Gollum, and time seems to stand still as they regard each other, with the ring glinting in Gollum's hand. Suddenly, Frodo lunges at Gollum, thudding into him and lifting him off his feet. Frodo and Gollum, locked in struggle, plummet over the edge of the chasm. The huge foot of the cave troll lands on Aragorn's chest, and he stabs at it ineffectually. Gandalf is in despair as Sam watches in horror while Frodo and Gollum disappear into the chasm. Gollum falls into the Crack of Doom and is instantly engulfed in the churning lava. Sam leans into the Crack of Doom, seeing Frodo clinging onto the rock face with his one good hand. The caverns shake violently as Sam desperately reaches for Frodo, who is too far down. Frodo looks at Sam, his face impassive, and struggles to reach him but can't with his bleeding hand, falling back and clinging to the rock with his good hand. Frodo looks at Sam imploringly, reaches up once more, and this time Sam grasps his hand tightly. The ring sits on the river of lava for a brief moment, then sinks away. The Eye of Sauron and Mount Doom are clearly seen from the great plains, and on the battlefield, all eyes turn to Mount Doom. The cave troll, with Aragorn at his mercy, is distracted by the sounds emanating from Mordor, turns in terror, and runs off. The Fellowship turns to watch as the massive dark tower of Sauron shakes itself to pieces. Towers fall, walls crumble, and vast spires of smoke and spouting steam billow up as the foundations explode apart. The black gates collapse in a huge cloud of ash, and the Orcs flee in all directions. The company watches as Mount Doom explodes, realizing the reason for their misery is clear: Frodo and Sam can never survive the cataclysm. The volcano erupts, fire belches from its riven summit, sending lava streaming down its sides. Frodo and Sam stagger out of the Sammath Naur as ash and molten rocks fall all around, and the skies burst into thunder, seared with lightning.",
    "392": "He is gone. She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut. The Dude stops between two albums and pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a picture of three young Germans, their foreheads looming below slicked-back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany. They are wearing severe but modishly retro suits. A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cover. The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot. Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette. It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman. Larry, a fifteen-year-old, looks at the two men. Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag. He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry. Walter is still holding out the homework. Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him. As he shoves the homework back in the attache case, he is heading for the door. Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman, without looking back at the Dude, who follows. He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase, and takes out a tire iron. CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters. CRASH! He takes out the driver's window. Lights are going on in houses down the street. A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter. He finishes hammering, rises, and grabs a straight-backed chair that stands nearby. When the door is opened—outwards, the chair clatters to the floor. Out of the blackness something is falling toward us. It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy. She is topless. She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky. A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion. It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters. A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck. Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears.",
    "920": "She looks out of a side window as rocks and crags skim past. Daylight falls through holes punched in the fuselage by another burst from the fighter. Bond nurses the stricken aircraft as the hunter swoops in for the kill and eases the floor throttle forward. The dying engines belch smoke, enveloping the fighter's cockpit. The transport moves to avoid the smoke, trapping the fighter between the larger plane and forcing it to slow. The fighter turns to avoid a collision and hurtles straight towards the rocks. He throws her a parachute. A red warning light shows generator failure. She opens the outside door for Bond, who gropes for his chute, then hauls on the stick to get out of the plane over the hill. As the two aircraft nearly collide, Bond raises the nose, gaining as much height as possible. Cargo strains in its straps, which snap back towards Camille. Both propellers give out under the strain. Bond drops down the vertical fuselage to Camille, grabs her, and they tumble out into space. He lets go of her parachute and dives for her as they and the plane continue to fall. M sits stony-faced. They are in the sunless steps of the sinkhole. He puts his jacket around her shoulders, stands, thinks for a moment, and then turns to her. They stare at one another until Bond breaks eye contact. She gives a small nod. He holds out his hand, she takes it and pulls herself up. They trudge through the chilly, rocky shadows and come to a rockfall. Bond kicks at some of the stones and picks one up, starting to climb up the rockfall. He comes to the top and pauses, seeing a huge underground lake. They walk down a tunnel with the roof held up by wooden supports. People cluster around, queuing for water, and argue amongst themselves. A man climbs up to peer into the well, but it is dry. A standpipe stops dribbling. The bus arrives at the dying town. A small group of people, joined by Bond and Camille, get on board. The bus's red tail lights shine through the dusty environment. Covered in dust, they arrive at the Grand Hotel. He heads unhurriedly upstairs, makes his way across the landing, and approaches the door of his room, pushing it open. He bursts into the bedroom, finding Fields' body on the bed covered in black oil. He is frisked and escorted out but then breaks another's knee and lays out a third. He grabs the keys, unlocks his handcuffs, and frisks his would-be captors. As the lift doors open, he cocks the automatic and calmly slips it into the waistband of his trousers at the small of his back.",
    "1256": "Peter and Rooney go to Carl's aid and prop up the smiling Carl, who then punches a random guy in the face. A burly guy knees him in the gut before the burly guy is restrained. Carl's face falls, and he looks as if he's on the verge of tears. At home, Carl lies beside his toilet with his legs wrapped around the toilet bowl and his head near the door. He stirs, opens his eyes, and they flit from side to side before he smiles. Carl leaves his apartment and locks his door, turning to find elderly, white-haired Tillie holding a hammer; she smiles and shrugs. Carl puts up shelves at Tillie's while Tillie knits. Tillie shakes her head. Carl's shirt is trapped in the door, and he tugs at his shirt, yanking it out and rolling backwards down a flight of steps. He sits up to see a scary dog charging towards him, but the dog's chain stops it just short of Carl, who is frozen in terror as the dog snaps its jaws inches from his face. A look of pained realization comes over him. Tillie pushes Carl back onto her bed and puts her false teeth into a glass. At work, Carl looks at an invitation on his computer. In his office, Norman receives the response and, beaming, gawks at the screen. Norman springs out of his chair excitedly and gives Carl the thumbs up through the glass wall of his office; Carl salutes him, and Norman salutes back. Carl pulls a silly face, and Norman hides behind a wall then jumps out. Carl pretends to look away, then looks back at him sharply. Norman turns his glasses upside down and flaps around like a bird, crossing his eyes and holding his hands out without his glasses on. Carl winds sticky tape around his head and tapes his nose up so it looks like a pig's snout, causing his face to look deformed and lumpy, and he sticks out his teeth. Norman looks uncomfortable and retreats, taking out cash. A bed is delivered, and Carl jumps on his new bed, where he's balanced a glass of wine on the corner that doesn't fall over. In a guy's room, Carl learns to play guitar, then takes off in a light aircraft with an instructor beside him. Carl sits at a desk in a Korean class, where his classmates laugh, and the teacher gives him a withering look. He ladles soup for homeless people while the vagrant is on his phone. Carl snatches a flier from the guy outside the cafe, pauses, checks his flier, then inside, Carl walks up to the bar and sits. It's the guy from outside the cafe, who walks up to the barman.",
    "720": "Rose swings the ax and hits the cabinet door, missing the first mark by several inches, and then approaches Jack. Rose grips the axe handle with both hands and moves her hands apart. Jack stretches the chain across the pipe and closes his eyes as Rose closes her eyes, swings, and cuts the handcuff chain in half. Jack lifts his hands and smiles, and they move into the corridor. Rose points to the flooded stairway, but Jack pulls her toward the opposite end of the corridor. Outside, passengers paddle two lifeboats away from the Titanic, and in one lifeboat, Molly and Ruth stare at the ship, now tilted forward with its bow nearly submerged. A flare shoots up from the bridge deck and explodes. On the boat deck, passengers crowd around the remaining lifeboats, and as Lightoller seats people in the lifeboat, one woman toting luggage tries to climb aboard. Lightoller pulls a sobbing gray-haired woman away from her husband and puts her in the boat. An auburn-haired woman cries and kisses a brown-haired man. Cal turns toward Lovejoy as he approaches. Rose follows Jack, who uses the axe to break through the door and into the corridor. A steward addresses them and follows Jack and Rose, but they glance back, causing the steward to stop in his tracks. Lightoller picks up a woman and places her in a boat as Andrews rushes over. Lightoller gazes out at several partially filled lifeboats moving away from the Titanic and motions to waiting passengers while several full lifeboats are lowered to the water. Fabrizio and other passengers pop open the third-class gangway door and peer out along the ship, but two seamen pull the passengers back in and close the door. Tommy and others stand at the locked gate atop the third-class stairwell as two stewards unlock the gate. A woman and several men rush through the open gate, and the stewards push back the men, punching them and hitting them with axe handles. One steward pulls out a small handgun and points it at the crowd now contained behind the closed gate. Jack and Rose reach the bottom of the third-class stairs, and atop the stairs, Tommy grips the gate and glares at the armed steward. Tommy glowers, points at the steward, then runs downstairs where Fabrizio rushes over, and Jack hugs him. In the suite, Cal removes the heart of the ocean, along with some cash, from the safe and puts it in his jacket pocket before glancing at Lovejoy, who opens his jacket, revealing a handgun in a shoulder holster. Cal closes the safe, locks it, and walks out. Elsewhere, Jack and the others run along a crowded corridor, and Jack leads them down another corridor, where they pass a mustached man flipping through a book and studying a sign on the wall.",
    "664": "Flash glares as Peter walks out of the swing doors, causing a tray to be trapped on the swing shot. Later, Peter strides towards his locker, examining his wrist as he goes. Flash marches after him, pushing students out of his way. Peter stands staring at his unopened locker when he hears a paper airplane zooming down the corridor towards a fly hovering by the fire alarm bell. In slow motion, he hears a spit wad being propelled from a blowpipe, followed by a fist. He swerves to his side as Flash's punch lands on the locker door. Flash, using his left hand, aims two punches at Peter, who dodges them. Then, in slow motion, Flash throws another punch, which Peter narrowly avoids. A punching white follows, and Peter arches his back as if doing a limbo dance to evade it. To avoid Flash's colleague, Peter flips into the air, somersaults, and lands on his feet. Flash charges again but fails to connect. Peter grabs Flash's arm, then punches him. Flash slides on his back down the corridor, collides with a teacher carrying a tray, and ends up with more food on him. MJ looks at him in wonder, Flash's crony and Harry seem awestruck, MJ is unsure, and Peter looks confused and a little frightened. He races off, running across a street intersection and coming to a gateway leading into an alley. Out of sight of passersby on the sidewalk, he scrutinizes his wrist where the web shot from, then turns over his hand to examine the swollen bite mark. He looks up and sees a spider's web woven around the coils of barbed wire above the gateway entrance and moves his hands closer to his face, noticing barbed bristles beginning to grow on the pads of his fingertips. Peter stares at the brick building behind him and, placing his hands on the surface, starts to climb. With ease, Peter scales the high-sided brick building, his fingertips almost sticking to the surface. Halfway up, he stops and looks down. Peter runs across the roofs of tall buildings, leaping across the gaps between them. Two children playing with a skipping rope are oblivious as Peter launches himself into the air above their heads. He lands on another roof and comes to a halt at the edge, once again scrutinizing his wrist. Opposite him, across the road, is a crane. Peter thinks for a moment, then loops from his wrist to the crane, thrusting his arm forward towards the jib.",
    "1153": "Filch fires the cannon by mistake as Cedric swallows hard and takes a deep breath, while in the competitors' tent, Harry sits alone in nervous trepidation. Harry walks out into a circular arena hewn from the rocky hillside and surrounded by a stone wall. High in the wooden terraces, Ron and Hermione stand amongst the cheering spectators. Harry resembles a gladiator in a Roman arena as he glances around cautiously and moves towards a gleaming golden egg standing amongst the gray rocks. He is knocked off his feet by the force of the dragon's tail, the massive head and body of which are covered with sharp, lethal spikes, as it blasts flame. Harry leaps for safety up a high rock, while the tethered dragon flies to the end of its long chain and lashes out angrily, giving Harry a vicious blow with its tail, flinging him onto the rocks below. The Hungarian Horntail flaps its huge leathery wings as Harry scrambles to his feet and dodges another burst of flame, causing the crowd to flinch and Karkaroff to laugh. As the dragon flaps towards him, Harry climbs out of range, but it lunges after him, baring its teeth. Taking shelter behind a huge rock, Harry sees his trusty broomstick zooming towards him while the dragon belches out another burst of flame. Harry leaves the rock, leaps away from the dragon, and jumps onto his Firebolt as it swoops down into the arena, with his friends cheering him on. The angry dragon stretches out its neck, breaking the chain, and the creature flies free. Followed by the furious dragon, Harry zooms around the arena, bursting out through the stands over the heads of the startled onlookers, wings tearing through the canopy and scattering professors who scramble to their feet as Rita Skeeter straightens her spectacles. Pursued by the dragon, Harry flies over the valley towards the school, narrowly avoiding colliding with a tall stone tower. The dragon launches after him as Harry swoops low over Hogwarts, with a faint mist rising. As he flies, Harry checks over his shoulder, but the dragon is nowhere to be seen. As Harry rounds one of the towers, the dragon appears and knocks him off his broomstick, causing Harry to fall onto a stiff roof and hurtle downwards, stopping his fall by grabbing desperately onto a narrow parapet. The dragon settles on a nearby turret as Harry dangles from the parapet, his gloved hands clutching a spiked pinnacle, seeing his broomstick far below. The dragon scrabbles across the turret onto the roof above Harry, and as the pinnacle snaps, Harry plunges down onto a windowsill, hanging on desperately as the sill collapses under him, while the dragon claws its way across the roof towards him, dislodging tiles like a colossal bat.",
    "1033": "Alex is already dressed, and he looks at her, bleary-eyed, as she leans down and kisses him, causing him to beam before Alex goes. Ryan and Natalie have breakfast at the hotel's outdoor cafe, sitting at one of many tables under a blue umbrella while she stares at him. They walk along a pier where Natalie has the photo of Julie and Jim. Natalie holds up the photo, which blows into the water. Ryan kneels on the edge of the wooden pier and reaches for it but falls in the water. In his hotel room, wearing a white towel and robe, Ryan dries the cut-out with a hair dryer. Ryan drags his case through the airport, with Julie and Jim poking out of the top, looking a little wrinkled and worn. In Detroit, the airport is shrouded in a snow storm as Ryan and Natalie drive along an icy road, glancing at each other awkwardly. Ryan parks in an office car park, and he and Natalie get out as she holds an arm full of strategy packets. A security guard leads them through a busy, open-plan office into a smaller office where Craig is on a computer screen via a video feed. Ryan looks at the screen and frowns while she smiles nervously and prepares the packets. A thickset bald man appears on a computer screen in front of Natalie. Ryan sits with her, and they look up to realize Mr. Samuels is in the next office on the other side of an opaque glass screen. In distress, Mr. Samuels' chest heaves as he picks up the packet, looks down, and starts to sob. Ryan frowns and looks between Natalie and Mr. Samuels on the screen, as the heavyset man shakes with grief. Natalie's eyes rove, she licks her lips, and Craig watches on his screen. Mr. Samuels looks down, startled, gets up, walks out, and Ryan and Natalie watch him wipe his hand across his face as he walks past the office therein. Natalie looks unsettled, nods slightly, looks down at a list of 40 names, flitting her eyes nervously, with number one being Mr. Samuels, and she crosses it out. In the snowy car park, Ryan talks to Craig on his cell phone while Natalie leans on the car. Ryan frowns as he listens, hangs up, and turns to Natalie. Later, in the north terminal of Detroit airport, Ryan and Natalie stand silhouetted against a large window with the nose of a jet looming outside. Standing on a moving walkway, Ryan looks at the wedding invitation with Natalie behind him, her smile fading. Natalie walks ahead, and Ryan stares thoughtfully at the wedding invitation and the RSVP slip before stopping, turning around, and heading back the way he came.",
    "548": "Indy and Henry run down the mountainside to the shoreline, where Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the gun's chamber and swings around as a Messerschmidt comes in for another pass. Henry hands his case to Indy, then suddenly spins around, screaming and shouting into a flock of sea gulls with his umbrella. Thousands of sea gulls take to the wing, and the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades shred them into a feathery white puree that splatters against the cockpit and clogs the engine. The engine sputters, causing the Messerschmidt to fall from the skies and explode off camera. Indy stands stunned like a statue as Henry walks back to him, and Indy wears a proud expression as he watches Henry walk down the beach. Meanwhile, the Sultan is seated in his royal chair, flanked by Walter Donovan and Vogel, and surrounded by his minions. Donovan holds the missing Grail Diary pages as he and the Sultan walk together through an archway. The Sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk, only to go past it and inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby. He points to the engine under the hood, and it is revealed to be Kazim, the spy at the court. Elsa comes down the stairs toward Donovan and Vogel as Sallah drives his car through the crowded streets with Indy beside him and Henry in the back seat, while Sallah waves his arms and shouts to a camel herder. Henry removes his hat and hits Indy with it. Elsa and Donovan's party, consisting of a supply truck, tank, and various other vehicles, move along through the box canyon, with Elsa, Donovan, and Vogel traveling in an open car. The tank is a vintage World War I model with enormous treads, and the Turkish soldiers wear native dress, carrying both carbines and sabers. Brody sits alongside Elsa in the rear of the car carrying Donovan. Henry and Sallah are at Indy's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance, with a car containing all their supplies parked nearby. Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills, and at that moment, the tank fires a shell in their direction. It whistles overhead and blows up the parked car, causing Indy, Henry, and Sallah to cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them. Kazim peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below, as bullets explode off the vehicles and cliff. Donovan and Elsa duck as a Nazi soldier falls from the tank, with bullets exploding around him, while Kazim's men, members of the Brethren of the Cruciform Sword, continue to fire.",
    "189": "Annie calculates a moment while Lindsey is back watching the TV Horror-thon and her eyes light up. Annie and Lindsey come out of the Wallace house, with Lindsey carrying a bowl of popcorn and Annie having a coat over her negligee. They walk down the street to the Doyles, the wind blowing strong and whipping the negligee around Annie's legs as they make their way down the street. The SHAPE steps into the glow of the streetlight and watches them. Tommy runs to answer it and opens the door, where Annie and Lindsey stand. Lindsey sees the TV and runs into the living room, taking off her coat, sitting in front of the TV, and eating her popcorn. She glances at Annie's coat as Laurie glances at Lindsey. Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the door. Laurie closes the door and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey engrossed in the Horror-thon. Annie hurries across the backyard and steps into the garage, walks to her car, tries the door, then quickly turns and walks out of the garage. Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse, finds it in the front room, takes out her brush and lipstick, and stands in front of the mirror primping. She glances up at her image in the mirror. Meanwhile, Tommy hides, preparing to jump out and scare Lindsey. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for Tommy and turns around looking for him. For a moment, he glances out the window and sees the figure of a MAN carrying what seems to be a BODY across the Wallace's backyard. Tommy SCREAMS and jumps out from the curtain, scaring Lindsey, who also SCREAMS and begins crying. Laurie rushes in from the kitchen, finding the children in tears. Tommy points out the window, and Laurie bends down to comfort her. Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and walks over to the couch in front of the TV set, and almost instantly, Lindsey stops crying and follows him, sitting up next to Tommy and hugging him. Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen. Meanwhile, the old Myers house looks ominous and foreboding silhouetted against the dark, whishing trees. The camera tracks behind the hedge where Loomis sits waiting. Suddenly, there are noises from the street, and three boys, Keith, Richie, and Lonnie, creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old house, staring fearfully at the dark, tomb-like structure. Loomis parts the hedge in front of him and stares. For a moment, Lonnie hesitates, then slowly moves through the front gate up toward the porch, while Loomis watches the young boy walk toward the house, unsure whether he should interfere or just watch.",
    "42": "Everyone at the table stands together at the rail watching. A woman rises on tip-toes and kisses a man gently; he only looks at her. She kisses him again, and he responds a little better. As she starts to kiss him again, he stops her. The man hangs up the phone, swings his feet out of bed, spears his slippers, and reaches for his robe at the same time. He shuffles sleepily to the door as Gideon exits his room and goes to the elevator. The cage is there; he opens the door, enters, closes the sliding grill, and presses a button. The cage starts down, but Gideon begins sneezing. Suddenly, the elevator stops between floors and the lights go out, then just as suddenly, the lights come back on and the elevator resumes moving down. Gideon shakes his head and leans back, whistling again until the cage comes to his floor and starts past it, leaving him confused. The night porter, asleep behind the desk, does not notice as the elevator continues past the lobby level toward the basement and out of sight. Silence follows as the motor stops, then a series of sneezes ends with a terrifying shriek. Rudely awakened, the night porter runs to the elevator shaft as his shoes squeak. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down, presses the call button, and the motor starts. An instant later, the cage appears and stops; the night porter opens the gate, pulls back the grill, and the camera rushes past him to pick up Gideon. Gideon's body sits on the floor of the cage in a grotesque, sprawling attitude resembling a puppet with its strings cut, except Gideon has no strings to cut—only a throat cut from ear to ear. In a close shot, Grandpierre appears doubly apoplectic as the camera pulls back to reveal Reggie and Adam in their bathrobes. Reggie shrugs, and she and Adam exchange looks before Grandpierre turns and leaves. Reggie and Adam start down the hall toward their rooms. Before hanging up, Adam reflects on Tex's words, then looks behind him, smiles softly, hangs up the phone, and heads for Reggie's door. Reggie slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door, undoes the bolt, and opens it for Adam to enter. He takes a bag to the bed, dumps out the contents, and begins examining the items one by one, taking one out of an envelope before putting on his glasses to read it. He hands her the glasses, and she looks through them.",
    "44": "After she hangs up, she briefly looks at Tex's body, shudders, and then hurries to the door. As Reggie leaves her room and goes to the elevator, she notices that it is in use after pressing the button, so she goes to the stairs and starts down. Between the landings, the stairs curve around the open elevator shaft, and as Reggie comes down the stairs, the cage with Adam inside rises into view. For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet before Reggie starts running downstairs. Adam pushes the emergency stop button and starts the cage down. As Reggie comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate, and starts toward the lobby, the cage is a few feet behind her. Reggie continues to run between the first landing and the lobby, with the elevator following. A taxi stands by the curb as Reggie leaves the hotel and runs to it. Adam tries to look past him to see Reggie but gives up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run. The camera leads Reggie as she runs through the nearly empty passageway, her footsteps echoing against the tile and concrete walls. The jumble of advertising posters passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons, and colors. Reggie pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, with an arrow for each. The camera pans sharply, 180 degrees, to pick up Adam rounding the corner in hot pursuit. Reggie starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps, and suddenly looks up in surprise to see Adam across the tracks on the opposite platform; he has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. They stare at each other for a moment before a bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train. Adam turns, running back through the exit behind him, as the approaching train can be heard. As the train pulls in and comes to a stop, the gendarme opens the door for Adam and escorts him out. Adam turns once more to look at Reggie as he goes, then quickly returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. From Adam's point of view, featuring him as he hurries from the car, he finds his way blocked by five nuns in large, white butterfly hats, taking him a few precious seconds to work his way around them. He stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows, and the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions for some sign of Reggie. As Adam enters the deserted area, there is, miraculously, no sign of Reggie. The camera pans to a phone booth, where we see Reggie's hand reaching up to dial a number.",
    "1029": "At the Hilton, Ryan sits in the low-lit bar, savoring a cool drink, as he watches a young woman who is staring at her cellphone with a set of car keys in her other hand. She looks at her key fob and is incredulous. They sit, comparing loyalty cards, and she stares at the card. Alex's eyes sparkle as she studies the concierge key and smiles thoughtfully. Ryan smiles, and they head to a room. Alex is an attractive woman with long, straight auburn hair. Ryan tries a swipe card at a door, but it doesn't open, so he uses another card to open the door, and they go in. Alex, in her 30s, with a curvaceous figure, walks across the room, naked apart from a tie around her waist, and lies on the bed, where the sheets are unruffled. Ryan is laying on cushions on the floor. Alex and Ryan sit facing each other and open their laptop computers, type an entry, and close their computers. Ryan stands by as Alex opens her hotel room door, she turns to him, they kiss, and they smile. She goes inside, closes the door, and he hangs a sign on the handle. Ryan swims in the hotel swimming pool, gets his shoes shined, and hires a car, as Hertz employees swipe his loyalty card through card-reading machines. In a gents outfit, Ryan looks at ties, then takes out his cellphone and looks at the display. Circular fields in various stages of production stretch to the horizon, with the fields being green, brown, and muddy yellow. There are grid pattern city streets, and Ryan arrives in Omaha. In his apartment block, Ryan pulls his case along a hall, lets himself into his small, sparsely furnished apartment, puts his keys on a worktop, pulls back a brown plastic concertina screen, and lays his case on the bed. A young woman comes in holding a large envelope and knocks on the worktop. Ryan takes out a large photo of a hugging couple stuck on a board, she smiles at him fondly and goes, and Ryan looks at the photo of the smiling couple. In a modern office building, the boss, Craig Gregory, has a meeting with Ryan and his colleagues. Prim, ponytailed Natalie stands by a screen, and a guy appears on the screen. Ryan frowns, worried, and goes to see Craig. Ryan smiles bitterly as she sits facing him. Chastised, Natalie sits back and looks down. Later, Craig goes to see Ryan in his office, where Ryan is standing, staring at a map of the U.S. Ryan turns to Craig and raises his eyebrows. Craig curls a piece of paper, holds up a finger, and shakes his head while Ryan screws up the piece of paper and throws it in the bin.",
    "209": "She screams, but the noise is cut off by the swinging door as George and his mother sit down at the table. Harry sticks his head through the kitchen door, and she follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. George and his father eat at the table, with a great similarity and understanding between them. Harry and his mother emerge from the kitchen, Harry balancing pies in each hand and on his head, and the camera pans with them as they cross. George and Pop remain at the table when Annie comes in with some dishes, then exits, only to return again from the kitchen and stop serving to hear his answer. She gives George a look and heads back to the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George, stopping when he realizes he has hurt his father. To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls to Annie, who is listening through the glass in the door. George and his father sit at the table, and at one end of the room, an orchestra plays. George wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table, carrying plates and pies with Harry. Several boys take the plates from him, and George looks at them, feeling grown up and out of place as Sam Wainwright enters behind Harry, waggling his hands at his ears as he talks. George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice. Sam is assured and breezy, wearing collegiate clothes, and George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting each other. An elderly, fussy school principal approaches George as Violet Bick enters and turns to face George, waving her dance program at him. Marty Hatch enters and suddenly stops as he sees Mary, staring at her while she talks to Freddie, a glass of punch in her hand. She turns around and sees George for the first time, losing her poise and staring at him. George stares back at Mary, who is smiling. Mary and Freddie are briefly together before Marty enters the scene, followed by George. Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing, with the camera following them as they dance. A whistle is heard offscreen, stopping the music, and Harry is on the orchestra platform with the whistle in hand. As the music resumes and couples begin dancing again, George and Mary look at each other and start their Charleston. We see a series of shots of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad, with Freddie needing no more. He leans against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George.",
    "1185": "The tables are spread with a banquet of mouthwatering food, cakes, sweets, pies, and shiny red apples. Harry looks at the empty chair beside him. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell bursts into the hall. Professor Dumbledore gets to his feet. Quirrell faints. As the students follow quickly into the Hall, Snape disappears through a side door. Harry and Ron run back down the long stone corridor towards the girls' bathroom. They hide as they see a monstrous shadow ahead of them. The troll is dragging a heavy club. Wiping her eyes, Hermione comes out of the toilet. She sees two green legs as thick as great tree trunks. Terrified, she stares up with horror at the troll's lumpy, green body blocking the doorway. Its horrible head, which looks like a squashed, green potato, is almost touching the high ceiling. Raising the club, the troll moves ominously towards her. Hermione locks herself in a toilet. The troll swings the club and smashes it along the row of cubicles. The flimsy partitions fall on top of Hermione. The boys burst into the bathroom. As more cubicles are smashed to smithereens, they throw broken pieces of wood at the troll. Ron hurls a length of metal pipe. Hermione hides under a row of wash basins. Terrified, she cowers against the pipes as the troll smashes a sink off the wall. Harry pulls out his wand. He grabs the swinging club and scrambles up onto the troll's back. He tries to shake him off. Harry hangs on with one hand. But before he can use his wand, he accidentally rams it up the troll's nostril. The angry troll holds Harry upside down, swinging him from side to side. Ron takes out his wand. The troll's club flies up into the air and hovers. Then, it falls and hits the troll hard on its ugly, green head. The troll drops Harry. He scuttles out of the way, as the troll reels dizzily around then crashes heavily to the ground. As the dust settles, Hermione creeps out from under the row of sinks. Water sprays out of a shattered pipe. She looks at the troll nervously. Harry pulls his wand out of the troll's nostril. He wipes it on his cloak. Ron smiles at Harry. Quirrell steps forward. He jumps as the troll gives a snot. At breakfast, Snape appears. Harry notices that Snape is limping. Harry's snowy owl flies into the great hall skimming over their heads. It drops a long thin parcel. Harry catches it. They unwrap the brown paper, to reveal a streamline broomstick with a highly polished handle. Stroking the white owl's feathers, Professor McGonagall smiles at Harry. Wearing leather gloves and scarlet and gold cloaks, the Gryffindor Quidditch team assemble in the player's tunnel.",
    "1014": "A bright white light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her, standing on a cliff before a cloudy sky. A boy leaps off a jetty towards a lake and is frozen in midair as the traffic helicopter for a local news program flies over Sacramento, California. Names appear beside the white silhouetted symbols for a woman, then a man, which have red hearts on them. A young woman comes out of her house, talking on her phone, and a phone rings. The smart, attractive, blonde woman, Abby, arrives at work at the local TV station, KSXP, in a control room where a cooking show is on a studio set, and Technical Director, Cliff, turns to Abby. The chef swigs wine from a bottle, and Mary has a swig as Abby's boss, Stuart, switches off his monitors in the toilet. In a restaurant, Abby sits at a table with a guy, and she takes out his profile, causing him to look peeved. Later that night, Abby walks past an illuminated fountain and heads along a path through the pretty ornamental gardens outside her apartment building. She lets herself in her front door, and her cat, D'Artagnan, trots over while Abby looks thoughtful and a little sad. As she gets ready for bed, a TV plays in her bedroom, and D'Artagnan treads on the remote and changes channels. He gobbles a marshmallow on the end of a long skewer and slurps a coffee. Abby looks at Mike haughtily, and grinning, he shakes her hand. Abby paces in her office and rolls her eyes on the studio lot as he gets between them and snogs her. Larry throws Georgia over his shoulder and carries her off while Abby is lying on the floor in her office closet, frowning and sagging as she pulls the closet door shut. A girl cycles past a garage apartment on a leafy street as Mike walks into the apartment, dumps his bag on a chair, and presses play on his answer phone, frowning and crossing himself as he grabs the answer phone. Mike goes next door with his nephew, where Mike's sister, Elizabeth, has a cake for him. The upstairs of Abby's apartment has a balcony with light streaming through open French windows. In her bathroom, Abby runs her fingers through her long, blonde hair as the cat is by a broken fishbowl and D'Artagnan trots out of the window, up a tree with Abby standing underneath. She climbs and looks across to a neighboring balcony with French windows open to reveal a handsome, muscular guy wrapping a towel around his waist. Abby clamps her hand over the cat's snout and ogles the guy as he flosses his teeth and Abby grins. The branch breaks and she hangs upside down.",
    "484": "A woman passes the window, pauses, and peers out before quickly going away from the window, allowing us to see her in clear silhouette. After seeing the woman, Mary expects to get some attention and dashes out into the rain to her car, gets in, opens the side window, and begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a young man opens the front door of the house, pauses, and starts down the path. Mary leaves her car and dashes for the shelter of the porch. Seeing that Mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand, and reaches the porch a moment after Mary. He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging uselessly in his hand, then back at her, and gestures her into the office, standing back to indicate that he will go after her. Mary goes into the office, and the young man, Norman Bates, somewhere in his late twenties, thin, tall, soft-spoken, and hesitant, follows her in and closes the door. He is now behind the counter, pushing forward the registration book, as Mary places her handbag on the counter. She takes the registration book, picks up the pen, and is suddenly struck with the realization that she'd better use an alias, so she writes the name Marie Samuels. Norman removes a key for Cabin One, and we see that there is a remaining key on the board. He goes to the door and opens it, revealing that the rain has slowed down considerably. Mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits, and watches as Norman runs to her car, gets in, and drives it to the parking space in front of Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch and waits before the door of Cabin One. Norman gets out of the car with a suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in, and switches on a light. Mary goes into the cabin, and Norman follows her, places the suitcase on the bed, goes to the window, and opens it. Mary closes the door, goes to the suitcase, opens it, and starts to take out a dress, with her handbag next to the suitcase. She glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at it almost with regret, contemplates hiding it, decides to, and starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks about at the closet, the drawers, etc., realizing all such places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution, opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again, and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading.",
    "525": "Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead and starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to a beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ, playing and shuffling from side to side to get its eyes' 3-D effect. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open-air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light and, walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a saint. It too gets put on the growing pile. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on top of the saint. Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco facade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps. She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.",
    "859": "Sandra goes behind the counter and into a gloomy corridor where she stops and looks at a door slightly ajar with light peeping through the gap. She steps towards the door, pushes it wide open, and enters the office, where shafts of bright sunlight stream through the small window above the desk, bathing her face in golden light. Sandra moves a chair to the wall, stands on it, and looks out the window to see Howard bound to an inverted cross, with enormous blisters bubbling on his skin. As the blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest throb, Sandra climbs down off the chair, and Kyle runs in and grabs her around the waist, but she elbows him aside. Audrey wakes up and runs to the office where Sandra is heaving the desk away from the door, then pushes Audrey away and runs outside. Percy grabs Sandra around the waist to turn her away as Howard's stomach explodes in a shower of steaming liquid. Percy heaves Sandra back into the office, where she flops on the floor. Charlie stares at Percy, leaning in the doorway, as he stares blankly into space, then falls flat on his face. His back is burnt off, steam wafts around his exposed organs, and later, in the storeroom, Percy lies under a white sheet while Bob leans on the covered corpse with a wretched expression, and Jeep stands in the doorway as Bob's face twitches. In the diner, Sandra, now bound to a chair with wrists tied behind her back, sits as bright shafts of light stream through gaps between planks nailed against the window. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a pill from a pot as Sandra, with tears on her face, nods. Audrey pops the pill in her mouth, offers Sandra a drink through a straw, and smiles, but Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes Audrey with a cold, bitter stare. Kyle walks in, prompting a shaken Audrey to get up and follow Kyle. Meanwhile, Charlie sits looking pensive as Audrey tries to tune the radio, turning the dial and moving the aerial around. Michael shakes his head, and Charlie looks down at her belly. Standing in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette, has a puff, regards her pretty face in the mirror by the light of a lantern and a couple of candles, with an expression fraught. She gently runs her thumb over her pregnant belly, then throws down the cigarette sharply, stamps on it, grabs her jacket, walks out, and sits alone in the kitchen with her feet up. She looks up and smiles at Jeep before taking her feet off the chair.",
    "1110": "A spider, bigger than a man's hand, jumps out of the box and scuttles past Harry and off down the corridor. Harry stretches out his hand, but a wind seems to draw him away as the door slams shut. Back on Harry's desk, the book opens and glows with light. Harry lands back in his chair in the school courtyard where they look at each other guiltily. As Hagrid walks towards the school, a boy rushes out past him, and they all run to the boys' dormitory, stopping in the doorway. The floor is covered with scattered books and papers, broken picture frames, and feathers. The mattress and pillows of Harry's four-poster bed have been slashed, and drawers have been emptied out. Hedwig the Snowy Owl sits on the desk as Harry searches through a pile of books on the floor. The Gryffindor team heads for the pitch, and in the hospital wing, Madam Pomfrey is standing next to a bed where a petrified girl is lying. Harry and Ron stare with horror at the stiff figure and a hand mirror. Hermione's eyes are wide open and staring as Harry gently strokes her outstretched hand in the Gryffindor common room. She sweeps out, and concerned, the students look at each other as Harry turns to Ron. In Hagrid's cottage at the edge of the dark forest, his dog Fang raises his head, and Hagrid picks up his crossbow, kicking open the door. Harry and Ron hide under the invisibility cloak as Lucius Malfoy opens the door and steps inside, stopping near the boys under the cloak. Fudge goes to take it, but Dumbledore stops him, taking the scroll and staring straight at Harry and Ron. Lucius Malfoy looks around suspiciously, crosses to the door, and giving the boys one last look, Dumbledore follows him. Fudge looks confused and stares at the huge dog as they leave, and the boys reappear. Lines of spiders are following each other up the wall and out of the window as Harry lifts down a heavy lantern, and the huge hound follows them outside. They look up at the light from the cottage window while the spiders crawl down the wall and on to the ground. Ron watches the spiders nervously as they scuttle after each other away into the forest. Harry starts walking and Ron follows Harry reluctantly, with Fang dropping ahead as they make their way through the dark night into the gloomy forest. Fang sniffs the ground as they are led deeper into the shadowy forest, terrified of spiders. Ron walks on his toes trying not to tread on them, while Harry ignores him and keeps on walking. Harry stops and holds up the lantern, revealing that the spiders have led them to the mouth of a large tunnel dug into the sandy soil under the roots of a tree.",
    "289": "She gets up from Jeff's lap and puts the overnight case on the table, then goes to the window and looks toward the song-writer's apartment, where the party has grown considerably larger, with an assortment of well-dressed people crowded into the studio, drinking and eating. Lisa stands listening, entranced, while Jeff watches her. She sits down on the edge of the divan near Jeff and leans toward him. Jeff's tension eases off a little, but he is eager to talk. Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom, and we see the dark apartment beyond him. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen, rotating the brandy to warm it. She is quite beautiful and holds two large brandy snifters, the stems between her fingers. She continues rotating the brandy and then comes forward, handing one snifter to Jeff, as Doyle reacts to her appreciatively. She offers the second to Doyle, who sort of smiles and takes the snifter awkwardly, bowing his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare. Lisa smiles in return, turns around, and goes back into the kitchen. Doyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not recovered from the first sight of her attractiveness. Then, quickly, his eyes move down and to the left to the open overnight case with its displayed lingerie. Slowly, Doyle's eyes travel back to Jeff, who quickly guesses what's on Doyle's mind and picks up the phone, turning his head to Lisa, who answers. Doyle looks suddenly interested and asks tersely, his head snapping back to Jeff, who answers. Doyle's head moves back to Lisa as she answers with a touch of pride in her voice. Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently. Doyle smiles at Jeff and then strolls over to the table, where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter, then goes to the window and looks out as they watch him expectantly. His voice is flat and to the point as he speaks without looking at them, and Jeff and Lisa stare at him in astonishment. Jeff then recovers and answers with some anger. He starts to place the room and spins around, his face losing all its friendliness, as she replies with some sarcasm. Lisa and Jeff converse, with Jeff reasoning and Lisa cutting in spiritedly. Doyle starts to pace up and down, throwing out a hand in careful explanation, while Jeff is resentful of Doyle's comments to Lisa. Doyle has turned away into the center of the room and swings around, as Lisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm, and Doyle comes toward the camera again.",
    "738": "A bearded man knocks into Jack and spills his beer on Rose. Bjorn slammed Thomas' fist to the tabletop. Rose pulls Tommy's cigarette from his mouth. Rose puffs on it. She blows out smoke and hands Jack the hem of her skirt. As Jack holds onto her dress, Rose slowly lifts her heels and rises onto her toes. Jack gazes down as Rose stands on her tiptoes and collapses into Jack's arms. Cal's manservant, Lovejoy, descends halfway down the staircase and peers around the room. He spies Jack holding Rose in his arms. The couples hold hands as they dance in a line through the crowded room. Fabrizio grabs Rose's hand and she grabs Jack. The line of dancers snake through the clapping drinking crowd. The next day, Rose and Cal eat breakfast at a table in the private promenade. Cal shakes his head. As Rose stirs her coffee, she and Cal exchange glances. Cal stands and flips over their dining table. Cal walks away. As he steps through the doorway, an aproned woman rushes over to Rose, then bends and picks up dishes. Rose crouches to help. Rose lays her hand on dark haired Trudy's shoulder and sinks against her chair. Later in Rose's room, Trudy laces up the back of Rose's corset. Ruth steps in. Trudy curtsies and steps out. Ruth walks to Rose and ties the laces of her corset. Turning her head, Ruth covers her mouth. She closes her eyes, exhales, and drops her hand. Ruth turns back to Rose. Ruth gazes at Rose, then reaches out her hands. Gently cradling Rose's face, Ruth kisses her cheek. She turns Rose back around, then continues lacing the corset. Rose grimaces as Ruth tightens the laces. In the dining room, a man plays piano as first class passengers, holding sheet music, sing. Rose stands between Cal and her mother. Jack descends the grand staircase. One hand in his pocket, Jack strolls toward the dining room where two stewards stand outside its doors. One steward wearing a dark suit steps in front of Jack. Inside, Lovejoy steps toward the door. Lovejoy emerges. Lovejoy hands the money to the steward. The two stewards escort Jack away. On the bridge, a crewman steps up to the captain. Captain Smith reads a note, then smiles at Ruth. Outside, Jack climbs a railing, then hops onto a deck where a boy wearing a cap winds a string around a top. The boy spins the top on the deck. Jack steps toward another railing, pauses, and picks up a black bowler hat and long coat from a chair. Donning the hat, Jack wets his fingers and plasters down his hair. Wearing the hat and coat, Jack grabs Rose's arm.",
    "890": "They both look over at Darcy, who glowers before striding away. Lydia and Kitty drag Denny and the other officer away. Lizzie looks puzzled and a little disappointed, but her bad humor disappears when she spies Charlotte across the room. She hurries over to her happily. Mr. Collins, all in black, prances over to the lady next to Lizzie. He holds out a hand to Lizzie, who reluctantly takes it, and they cross the floor to join the dance. They curtsey and bow, circle each other. Then, he returns to the line of men. As Lizzie dances, Mr. Collins leers at her, then, normally, makes to follow her in the dance. Darcy is watching with amusement. Lizzie sees him looking and glares. Darcy's face drops and then returns to his usual stern composure. He slowly walks around the dancers passing Mrs. Bennet deep in conversation. He watches Jane and Bingley performing the intricate moves of the dance. As they cross each other, briefly holding each other's outstretched hands, Darcy seems to take more of an interest in them. He looks contemptuously at Lydia dancing with gay abandon with the officers. Darcy turns back on himself stopping by flickering candles, his eyes once more drawn back to Lizzie, skipping in a circle with her dance set, her dark hair swinging like a ponytail. Darcy's gaze is steady, his high white shirt collar and dark coat frame his stern features. Another dance is taking place. Charlotte and Lizzie are talking. Darcy is standing before them. He bows. They curtsy in return. He bows once more and leaves. Lizzie resignedly leaves Charlotte's sight. With the men on one side of the floor and women on the other, Lizzie and Darcy stand opposite to each other looking serious. The men slowly bow and the dance begins. The gentlemen and the ladies grasp each other's hands, and circle one way, then the other. Lizzie and Darcy maintain steady eye-contact throughout. As they move away from each other, then double back to cross over, a slight smile is playing across Lizzie's lips. Darcy's face betrays no emotion. They form a straight line with another couple before releasing hands, turning and coming to a brief halt facing each other. The dance forces them away from each other. She sighs heavily raising her eyebrows. They circle each other holding hands. Darcy is still serious. The passing of the dance leads Lizzie away for a moment, then back again. They separate to allow a couple to move between them, then they return to being opposite to one another. Lizzie hides a look of amusement as the dance continues. The nine couples move in unison watched by other guests, a magnificent chandelier hanging over their heads.",
    "742": "Skeeter looks away troubled as her mother weighs her words carefully. Skeeter, looking at her handsome, regal-looking mother, nods in acknowledgment but then lowers her eyes. Smiling warmly, Charlotte leans in and kisses Skeeter on the forehead. Skeeter tries to smile but is overcome by sadness, and Charlotte hugs her tightly. Out in the sunshine, Minnie is strolling towards Celia's house with a bag of groceries, fanning herself in the heat, when a red Chevrolet Corvette Convertible rolls into view. Minnie's eyes shift, but she doesn't quicken her pace. The car zooms right up behind her, and she turns to see Johnny at the wheel. She hurries towards the house, throws down the grocery bag, and picks up a loose branch before tossing it away. Johnny helps pick up the groceries, hands her her bag, and with a gentle guiding hand at her back and a good-natured smile, he walks her towards the house. In the heavily decorated dining room, Celia, in an off-the-shoulder dress, carefully places a dish of cookies into the center of the table, alongside a cooked ham, several cakes and pies, and other dishes of food. Johnny, taking off his jacket, leads the way into the dining room and stands next to his wife. Minnie looks bemused, then her lips crease into a smile as Celia beams from ear to ear. Johnny pulls out a chair for Minnie, and as Celia serves up, Minnie looks admiringly at the spread in front of her. Minnie and Aibileen, smartly dressed, hurry to church where the whole congregation stands. Looking bewildered, Aibileen joins in the clapping, then looks from smiling Pearly to smiling Minnie, who proffers her the book, and she stares at it numbly. With her eyes lowered, she takes it from him, and finally, summoning up a smile, Minnie, standing with the congregation, lifts an approving eyebrow. Aibileen beckons her to join her, and she, too, seems suddenly shy, stepping up next to her friend in front of all the people. The two women stand arm-in-arm facing the packed church. Outside her home, Skeeter leafs through the pages of signatures, her expression solemn, hesitating to meet their gaze. Aibileen holds out her hand to Skeeter, who smiles and nods through her tears. Back on duty, Aibileen lets herself into Elizabeth's kitchen through the back door, her arms loaded with groceries. Hilly is with Elizabeth and her baby son, and Mae Mobley runs up to Aibileen, but Hilly blocks her. Elizabeth hurries out of the room with the baby as Hilly eyes Aibileen with ice-cold menace. Aibileen grabs Hilly's arm, and with her lips trembling, Hilly holds Aibileen's firm gaze then runs off into the next room. Aibileen blows out her cheeks as she tries to catch her breath.",
    "947": "The man heads off as bearded, middle-aged Meinhard gets out of a carriage outside of the Addrelle de Fleuve, with a rough looking bloke hovering nearby with another identical man, keeping an eye on Meinhard. At a gypsy camp in the countryside, men practice their horse riding skills as Holmes and Watson drive up on the outskirts of the camp in an open carriage. A man comes over to hold their horse while Watson calls over to a group of men and nudges Holmes, who appears to be asleep. A gypsy man indicates a bearded man holding a goose, and the gypsies surround Holmes and Watson, who smile politely. The man takes it, then Watson knocks him cold, causing the atmosphere to become more strained. A man opens his jacket, revealing a knife, and Sim pushes through the crowd with her bag, which the gypsies have taken off Holmes. The man Watson punched watches as they eat a meal, with Watson looking up from his bowl and frowning while Holmes glares at him. Sim hands the drawings to the gypsy man, who passes them to Holmes, and Holmes licks the red stain before turning conspiratorially to Watson. Holmes drinks from a proffered bottle as Watson gets up and dances energetically with a gypsy outside, with Sim joining in too, while Holmes watches and twitches his shoulders in time with the music. At the castle home of Mycroft Holmes, Mary walks into a study and finds him completely naked. She takes the telegram and goes as Carruthers goes, while Stanley, the dithering ancient butler, turns around. Under a leaden sky in Paris, a carriage with Imperata stenciled on the side pulls up on a side street, and Sim, Holmes, and Watson are ushered from it into a building where they pass two men wheeling a coat-of-arms shaped cake on a trolley. They are led into a busy kitchen, making their way past chefs working at worktops until they are stopped and searched by another man. Holmes notes an empty baking tray, some royal icing in gold leaf laurels, a shield, and a newspaper on a worktop before he, Sim, and Watson are ushered down some stairs to emerge in a basement room where a man, Ravache, sits at a table with his back to them, eating. Watson sniffs a piece of paper as Holmes and Sims sit down. Ravache takes a gulp of red wine, wipes his mouth with a napkin, sips his wine, and then shoots himself in the head. Upstairs in the kitchen, his colleagues hear the shot and run off to investigate while Holmes gets to his feet, and Watson fires warning shots up the stairs as Holmes stares into an alcove.",
    "766": "The torch flows brightly as the shining light gives way to the pitch-black darkness of space, where a shining parabola cuts through the inky blackness. The curving edge of planet Earth is illuminated, dwarfing further planets in the distance, while the glowing rings of Saturn arc around the planet's central sphere. Fast solo flares erupt from the surface of the sun, with tendrils of white-hot flame flickering around the billowing molten components, leading to a swift transition to Earth on a rainy night. The gates of a mine open, and a taxi drives through, carrying the spectacled 30-something Adrian Hold, who spots a young boy sitting by a key, cuddling with a toy boat. The driver ignores Adrian and drives through a puddle, splashing the boy and his boat. Inside the Institute of Astrophysics at the University of New Delhi, they stand on a rickety, descending limb. The lift reaches the bottom where a bearded man has been switched over, and Gurdeep grabs ice buckets. At a computer terminal, another screen displays the solar eruptions, and Adrian frowns at the screen. Gurdeep pours ice around Doctor Lokesh's feet, and a door opens into a dark chamber containing a water tank. Gurdeep helps Satin open up the large tank as Adrian stares down into the tank, where the water inside bubbles and boggles. Meanwhile, Adrian arrives at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel in Washington D.C., where he takes a document from his bag. A barely 40-something Anheuser frowns at Adrian, takes the document from his hand, and puts his drink down on a waiter's tray, walking off with the document while fishing a pair of glasses from his top pocket on the way past Adrian. Anheuser reads the document in a quiet corner of the party while Adrian stands behind him. Anheuser frowns, looks up, and turns as Scotty, with Adrian's duffle bags still in his arms, watches Adrian follow Anheuser from the party. During the day, police try to control an anti-G8 protest as a car drives across a spherical building. The distinguished-looking 60-something US President Wilson enters the G8 Summit, scanning around a large table where many other people are either standing or seated. An interpreter leaves the station, and a large number of the other people present file out of the room, leaving Wilson looking around as the double doors close behind him, with eight heads of state remaining. Meanwhile, military choppers fly over the shoreline village as locals board trucks, including a young villager named Nima. Soldiers stop Nima's brother Tenzen from following the truck as it drives away, and villagers raise their hands while Tenzen raises his hat. The Kernel points, and the villagers look up as controlled explosions detonate high in the mountains, while MI Techs Officer Isaac arrives outside his suite.",
    "1361": "Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to, and she walks in on a shouting match between Josh, a leftist angry news writer, and Dori, the entertainment-leaning co-writer. Javier, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite and they all laugh. Abby talks to Stuart Wardlow, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager, and looks worried but nods in response to him. She then rips out an extra two feet of floss and holds up her clipboard, which has a guy's E-Harmony profile and photo. Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy, and there's an awkward silence between them before she pulls out another piece of paper and hands it to him. She hears a noise coming from her bedroom and sees D'Artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish. He holds up several books, reading the titles, then drops the books, picks up a can of gasoline, and pours it on them. Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth, mimes swallowing, and then we pan off the television to the bed where Abby watches, appalled. Mike hangs up the phone, and Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing as we intercut between the stage and her apartment, with Mike continuing his rant. Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed while Mike bowls over laughing. Abby and Joy make their way into the conference room where Dori and Josh are already present, and on TV, Mike's face appears. Joy looks at Abby, who holds up a piece of paper for Stuart to read, and then she spins to face him. Abby is pacing on the verge of hysteria when there is a knock on the door, and Mike appears. Abby glares at him, and he stares back, surprised, as she gags and pushes past him, walking out. Abby strides down the hall with Georgia and Larry, then Mike gives a cocky wave and Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. In the control room, Abby smirks, but then looks like she's going to pass out as Cliff shrugs. Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard; after a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms and he throws her over his back, hauling her off the set. Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet when Mike's sister, Elizabeth, walks in wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. She hands him the cake box, gives him a kiss on the cheek, and he grins. Elizabeth fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear as he crosses to a candle-lit table with a fancy dinner placed in the center and several books beside it, while a man plays violin nearby.",
    "676": "A car crashes through, prompting Peter to dive across the table at MJ, grabbing her and pulling both of them to the floor just as the car flies past their heads and lands upside down on its roof in the middle of the cafe. Peter helps MJ to her feet, and they hear thuds coming from outside. The ground shakes as Peter sees the three-pronged pincers at the end of a mechanical limb approaching the cafe, supporting Octavius. One limb drags Peter to Octavius, while another removes Octavius' shades. The limb clutching Peter throws him across the cafe, causing him to slam against the back wall and fall to the floor amidst debris. Octavius smiles at MJ, then uses a limb to grasp her firmly and stride away with the other three, while he remains elevated, limbs protruding from his metal spine as they climb up a building, eventually disappearing from view. Peter bursts from the rubble, stands firm, and runs onto the street. His vision is blurry with his glasses on, but clear without them. After taking them off and dropping them to the ground, a lens pops out as it bounces. Peter clenches his fist, looks around, and, with determination, strides on. At the Bugle, Robbie enters the editor's office, and Jonah's eyes grow weary at the sight of the Spider-Man costume hanging on the wall. He turns away as Spider-Man once again swoops and soars through the streets of New York, propelling himself with webs between tall buildings. As Spider-Man approaches the Westside Tower, Octavius climbs over its clock face, and Spider-Man lands on the flagpole at its peak. A limb clashes with the pole, and a hand-to-hand fight ensues, with Spider-Man's two fists against Octavius' six limbs. Spider-Man is thrown but manages to grab a clock hand until a limb knocks it off, causing him to fall. He shoots webs at the clock face, catching the falling hand with another web before flinging it at Octavius, embedding it in the wall next to him. However, Octavius' limbs break it in half and hurl the pieces at Spider-Man. A limb punches Spider-Man down, but he attaches two webs over Octavius and pulls him, resulting in both men descending together and crashing onto the roof of a passing train. Bouncing along the carriage roofs, they rise and face each other as the train continues between the city buildings.",
    "682": "Underwater, the body of Octavius, the four limbs still attached to him, floats downwards, as does the sphere, and the entire lab sinks below the surface of the river. High on a crane, Spider-Man has woven a web over which he crawls to MJ, and he lies beside her way above the river, the lights of the city twinkling far below them. She looks earnestly at him, and he stares at her. She screws up her face and fights back tears. Down below, a convoy of squad cars speeds towards the waterside. Up on the web attached to the crane, MJ turns to face Spider-Man once more, and he half-smiles. Later, he eases her down towards the ground with an ever-lengthening string of web emanating from his wrist. As she glides elegantly down from on high, the convoy of cars draws closer to her, their lights flashing. The lead car slues to its left and stops, and the passenger door opens and out steps John, who looks up at the descending MJ. As she lands on the bridge of a boat, John races towards her, and she turns on hearing him approach. John leaps from the pier onto the boat, then clambers upstairs as MJ descends towards him. Meeting in the middle, they hug tightly. As John nuzzles her neck, MJ looks across and up to the crane, where a distant figure squats in true Spider-Man pose. Peter slips on the mask, looks at the city, then round to MJ, before leaping into the night sky carried by a web. Tears trickle down MJ's face as she rests her head on John's shoulder. Meanwhile, Harry sits alone in the apartment, fondling the blade of the dagger with which he'd intended to kill Spider-Man. Hearing a noise, Harry gets to his feet, the dagger in his right hand, and takes a few paces forward and listens. A door opposite him swings open, and Harry looks anxiously around and stares up at the balcony surrounding the room. He turns to the full-length mirror and stares at his late father, shakes his head, then flings the dagger at the mirror. It crashes through his father's reflection to reveal a room beyond. Stupefied, Harry moves to the mirror doorway, avoiding the jagged pieces of broken mirror, and slides through into a brick chamber. There are cobwebs, which he brushes aside as he strides through, then turns, catching sight of something out of the corner of his eye: the mask of the Green Goblin. Harry crashes into a set of shelves filled with spherical bombs, there are row upon row of the weapons his father once used, and Harry catches sight of a cylindrical vial containing a phosphorescent green liquid. He picks it up, examines it, then marches into another section of the secret chamber.",
    "1170": "Harry lines up next to the keeper, Oliver Wood, and swallows nervously. The gate opens, and the teams step forward. One after the other, they fly out of the player's tunnel and swoop around between the tall spectator towers, which surround the oval grassy arena. A student introduces the game. In the stands, Gryffindor supporters wear red and gold scarves, while Slytherin's colors are green and white. The Slytherin team fly out in their green cloaks. Standing around the oval arena, the spectators cheer on their teams, with other spectators seated at the top of tall towers hung with heraldic designs. The players hover above the Quidditch trunk, which stands quivering in the center of the pitch. Madam Hooch kicks the trunk, and the lid falls open as three boars fly out. She lifts out the red Quaffle and throws it high into the air. A Gryffindor chaser, Angelina, grabs the Quaffle and heads straight for the goal. The spectators duck as the players swoop low over their heads. The Slytherin players try to hit Angelina off, but she's too quick for them. She aims for the center hoop, and the Quaffle sails straight through the middle, putting points on the scoreboard. Harry is nearly knocked off his broomstick by a passing Bludger. Hagrid cheers on the Gryffindors, while Snape stares and Quirrell looks nervous. The Slytherin captain gives Angelina a slight kick. Dodging a Bludger, he hurls the Quaffle towards a hoop, then scowls as Oliver skillfully knocks it away and gives him a cheeky smile. The Gryffindors capture the Quaffle, ducking and diving, passing it around the team from chaser to chaser. Well placed in front of the goal, Angelina catches the Quaffle and hurls it straight through the center of the hoop, past the helpless Slytherin keeper, adding twenty points on the scoreboard. The Gryffindor supporters are ecstatic. The Slytherin captain aims again for the goal, but Oliver catches the Quaffle, and the captain smiles angrily. Snatching a bat from a beater, he deliberately hits a Bludger straight to Oliver, who falls backwards through the hoop and hurdles downwards, landing heavily on the dry sand below the goal. Harry stares with disbelief at the cheating Slytherin captain. Malfoy and his cronies celebrate while Professor McGonagall watches anxiously. A Slytherin sails over the beater's head and shoots accurately at the hoop; the Quaffle flies through, giving ten points to Slytherin. Harry clenches his fists with frustration. The Slytherin captain points at Angelina, and with his teammate, on each side, jostles and confuses her. She collides with one of the tall spectator towers, tumbles down behind the canvas covering, and lies without moving on the gravel path below.",

They stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief. He glares at her. Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross. Salieri stares at the cross. Salieri stirs himself. A servant appears. She looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it. To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri. He opens his mouth in distress. The candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. CU, the fireplace. In it lies the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning. Mozart chuckles delightedly. Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking. Hysterical barking and howling. The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, Michael Schlumberg. Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart. Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands, and preludes over the keys. Instantly, a dog howls loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Mozart stops. Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls louder. He bows to them and leaves the room. Both men embrace. A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. Also, there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food. Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health. He carries the bag across the room. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled. He opens the door of the bedroom. Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold. Leopold stares back from the doorway. He closes the door again. He picks up some pages of manuscript. Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children. As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. Applause. All the bystanders are watching. SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her. A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle.",

He flashes a confident smile, opens the window, and checks out his Psych project: a small maze with several flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other. Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms. Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables while Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. Heidi, beautiful and wearing ripped jeans with no makeup, is there. Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side. Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket, although his hand clenches on the cue, and he meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks. Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall on the bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned, and Heidi strokes his chest, but suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air. Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini-fridge, and Heidi takes one. Heidi then looks under the bed. Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's reading. As Evan reads, the world seems to almost imperceptibly vibrate around him like a tuning fork. He looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings. Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling backward, his forehead bleeding freely as Tommy knocks him hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it, and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside. Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile. Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs Tommy's foot, and holds on, but Tommy yanks his leg back, breaking Evan's grip. Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack. Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake. After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded. Evan drives and, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Now 20, Lenny is making a model airplane in a room filled with model airplanes. Mrs. Kagan, grayer and fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside. Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw dropping. We see Lenny's working on the model again, in his own world. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk but is startled and drops the model on the desk.",

Green forests surround a misty mountain that towers over a lake, where Rambo's boat sits serenely at its home harbor. Rambo sits on the deck with his elbows resting on his knees, toying with the crucifix Sarah gave him in his sinewy hands, looks up thoughtfully, and then stands. Sheets of lightning bombard dark mountaintops, and a montage of flashback images of Rambo in combat suddenly fills his thoughts before Rambo lies in a hammock. He climbs out, and in the rain-soaked darkness, a figurine silhouette holding an umbrella stands in the half-light, lowers the brolly, and walks toward him. Rambo switches on a light to reveal Marshall, a middle-aged man with neat gray hair, wearing a dark overcoat over a collarless pale blue shirt. Rambo starts thinking about something and then walks toward him, before beating a piece of hot steel, shoving the metal into burning coals, and dousing the white hot metal in water, which cools to form the shape of a machete. On a rainy morning, Reese, one of a motley collection of mercenaries in Rambo's boat—including bearded Diaz and En-Joo, handsome stubbly School Boy, and bald Lewis—sings, while Rambo sits at the tiller, watching them. Lewis stands at the prow of the boat, looking out at the river, while Rambo stares at Lewis blankly. Lewis returns the stare, and Rambo looks vacantly ahead. With an angry glare at Rambo, Lewis returns to the prow of the boat and continues his belligerent surveillance while Rambo gazes out across the water surface as a flock of birds takes off en masse. A watchtower at a military camp is surrounded by razor wire as troops eat in a large mess tent, and one idly throws leftovers over his shoulder into a cage of female prisoners outside. Three soldiers troop out of the mess hut as the Burmese flag is raised on a pole, beneath which are two ranks of downcast male prisoners, now army draftees. A drill instructor thumps one in the stomach, and the camp huts sit on timber with above-ground supports as foundations. Sarah lies bound beneath one, where the foundation is divided into two sections, and in the section next to Sarah, two fat pigs fight over food. Through the slat, she watches a soldier walk away from the hut as the commander and the subordinate have an overview of a larger compound in which the pigs roam freely. Opposite the soldier's vantage point and above the piggery is a cage in which the downcast male survivors of Michael's party kneel, their hands tied behind them, and their faces muddy. One lifts his head and catches the commander's eye.",

Whip closes his eyes. Whip is startled awake. He looks around the dark room, then clicks on the light. He peeks into the corridor as a nurse walks by the reception desk. He quickly limps down the hall using a cane. He sees Nicole sitting on the stairs smoking a cigarette. She rises to leave. She sits. Whip leans against the wall facing her. He lights a cigarette. She shakes her head. A patient climbs the stairs. Nicole tosses her pack. The gaunt man stands by his IV pole. She shakes her head. She glances at Whip. The bold man turns to Whip.

A retro stereo sits on a cabinet against the wall with framed photos. Whip, his eyes still covered by a bandage, looks around. Whip carries a plastic bag into the kitchen and places it on a dining table. He plugs in a charger and checks his iPhone. It shows 127 voice messages. He leans on a bureau and pulls out a prescription bottle from his pocket. He glances at the pills, then at a decanter of whiskey. Another liquor bottle is near the stereo. He licks his lips and clenches his jaw. Using a cane for support, he strides into the bathroom and dumps the pills down the toilet. He collects the bottles of liquor and the decanter and turns on the stereo. He empties the bottles in the sink. Then, he dumps the empties in the garbage. He takes a case of Corona and some other beer cans from the fridge, and also, drains them. He dumps the cans in a bin. He takes a bag of marijuana from a wooden box in a drawer and flushes it. He continues his chore with determination as he moves from cabinet to cabinet, removing and tossing bottles and cans.",
    "1243": "Brian smiles wryly with his arms folded, then leans forward and shakes the chairman's hand. On a crowded tourist beach by a Majorcan hotel, Brian is bare-chested playing football with his kids, while Peter cavorts around with them in the impromptu game. Fat holiday-makers laze on lounges as a man smears some cream over his obese folds. Brian kisses Peter's cheek playfully and holds his arms aloft to celebrate scoring, as Barbara frolics in the surf with Peter and the kids. Wearing aviator shades, Brian nods smiling, with them beckoning him to join. His face becomes sober as he turns over the back page of the paper to see the sport headline. By the hotel, a waiter points Brian out to a man in a panama hat and blazer, who wanders down the sandy beach carrying a briefcase towards Brian, now lying on his back in the sun. The man in the blazer dabs sweat from his face as he stands over Brian. Still wearing his shades and an intrigued expression, Brian raises himself up onto his elbows, looking up at Archer. Peter marches off along the jetty away from Brian, leaving him pacing furiously, hands on hips then on his head in despair. In a home game, a Luton Town player in orange stripe weaves through the lead-footed Leeds midfield as Bremner sulks beside Clough on the bench. Behind them, Don makes his way to a seat with the directors and eyes Brian gloatingly. A Luton striker scores and the Leeds fans cheer as Brian escorts his team down the tunnel, finding Cussins waiting. The Leeds players trudge into their dressing room as Cussins leaves Brian with his hands on his hips. Brian makes to follow Bremner into the dressing room but has the door slammed in his face. The players, now showered and in their fashionable clothes, join the directors in the long, narrow lounge, with Brian traipsing in last to face Cussins. A player obliges, as Cussins eyeballs Brian then turns to the players. Brian wrinkles his nose with distaste as Bremner, sat beside Giles, winks at him. Brian nods and swallows hard, his new young signings looking troubled as their manager steps into the corridor. Jimmy finds Brian outside the door, with Manny Cussins in the boardroom. Brian smarts, straightens his jacket, and glances around the board members as Cussins glances at the other directors. Brian leads Nigel down the corridor, passing Don's photo, then finds himself in makeup for Yorkshire TV. The presenter knocks on the door, and Brian winks and smiles wistfully. Now, in the studio, the floor manager leads Brian to his seat before the cameras. Brian notices two other chairs and sits as the tall, handsome presenter leads a bullish Don through the dark studio into the lights of the set.",
    "726": "A viola player glances back, then returns and joins him. The bass player carries his bass back, then stands on the other side of Hartley. The cello player also returns. Captain Smith stares across the wheelhouse. He gazes through a window at the rising water, then places one hand on the helm. Water pours in beneath the door. In the smoking room, Andrews checks his pocket watch as the glass slides off the mantel. He opens the clock on the mantel and adjusts the time. He shuts the clock, then leans against the mantel, gazing downward. An elderly couple lies in bed as water streams beneath them. The man kisses the woman. A red-haired woman leans over two young children lying in a bed. The children sleep. Elsewhere, a Degas painting of a woman wearing a long tutu floats beneath water. On deck, people run past the band. People scramble about. Fabrizio unties the lifebelt on Tommy's body. People rush away from the rising water. The girl in Cal's arms looks around herself, wide-eyed. People work to right the overturned lifeboat. One sailor slides down a rope. Fabrizio puts on the lifebelt as water surges around him. Water rushes over the listing ship, causing some people to fall into the water. Fabrizio opens the knife and Cal backs away from the rushing water. Fabrizio and others try to cut the ropes. Inside, people slip and fall near the Grand Staircase. Guggenheim, wearing a top hat and formal wear, sits in a chair, watching with wide eyes. Outside, people fall into the water as others run up the deck from the approaching water. In the wheelhouse, Smith stares wide-eyed as water covers the glass windows. Outside, on one of the decks, passengers wade through waist-deep water toward the lifeboat in the middle of the ship. Fabrizio slices through the rope with his pocket knife, partially freeing the boat but causing it to tip onto its side. Cal climbs onto the high side of the capsizing lifeboat. Railings pull themselves onto pieces of floating debris. Several people run toward the back end of the Titanic, which is now tilted up at a slight angle. Some passengers hang from ropes or leap into the icy sea. Jack and Rose make their way to a railing near the rear of the ship and turn back. Jack grabs Rose's hand and runs through the crowd. They make their way to the crowd. Water swamps the base of the first funnel as it sinks below the ocean's surface. Inside the ship, seawater floods the grand staircase. Passengers and crew grab onto anything they can as the water rises. Jack climbs over a railing and helps Rose climb over.",
    "958": "Footage of his first birthday shows his mother blowing out a solitary candle on his cake and then picking him up in her arms. Now Joe is about three years old, and his mother measures his height against the wall and kisses a cut on his hand better. Joe watches as the footage changes to him with his mother at Christmas; on screen, she smiles as Joe holds up a present. He watches somberly as on screen, his mother picks him up and plays with him in the garden, and she laughs into the camera. Un-shed tears form in Alice's eyes as she watches. Captured together on the home movie, Joe and his mother play together on some distant summer's day, and Joe waves at the camera. Joe looks over at Alice, who is sitting with her back to him, her shoulders heave and tears roll down her face, struggling to find the words as Joe stares at her. Alice watches the last bit of footage which is of Joe's mother pushing him on a swing. The film runs out and spins around on the reel. Joe and Alice see the rattling noises coming from the strange cube Joe took from the crash site; it vibrates across the tabletop. Alice wipes the tears from her eyes, and Joe picks up a pencil and gently prods the cube. It continues vibrating, and he and Alice exchange a look. The cube shoots off the table and smashes through the wall, leaving a hole in the wall and a poster of the space shuttle pinned to it. Joe and Alice go over to the hole and peer through it, seeing the lights of the tomb and the water tower in the distance. They exchange a look. Later, Alice carefully slips her key into her front door and opens it, steps into the hall, and puts the key in a dish on a sideboard. She sees Louis sitting in the front room, goes in to him, and finds him smoking and drinking. Wounded, she runs outside, grabs her bicycle, and rides off. Louis comes running out after her. Fighting back tears, Alice cycles grimly on, with Louis coming after her in the yellow Coupe. She glances nervously over her shoulder as the V8 barrels after her, then rounds a corner, and the coupe clips the curb as it takes the corner. Alice jams her brakes on and pulls a u-turn in the road, cycling back past Louis. Taking his eye off the road, he careens into the back of a parked car. Hearing the impact, Alice stops and looks back. As she stares at the wreck, she doesn’t notice a massive creature moving behind her.",
    "788": "The vans are up the roadside, and as Gin gets closer, he sees it's Marcus waving a torch. Gin stops in front of Marcus, who moves his Stetson and gets out of the car with a wary expression, shaking his head weirdly. Marcus gives him a helpless look, and Gin heads back to his car while Marcus smiles. Gin lifts the bonnet of his Chevy, and with the bonnet up, Gin steps back from the car. Marcus steps forward with the jump leads but can't reach the battery, so he backs away from between the car and the van as Lois starts the van up. Gin leans back against the grill of the Chevy and lights himself a smoke. Marcus nods to Lois, and she drops the van into gear, hits the gas, and crushes Gin between the two vehicles. Lois reverses, and Gin slithers down the grill of the Chevy onto the ground. Marcus walks up to him, sighs, and walks to the van. He removes the jump start cables from the van, returns to Gin, and clips them onto his ears. Back at Thurman's, Willie opens the front door to Sue, who's got a bag of groceries, and he eyes her figure appreciatively. In the kitchen, Thurman and Willie make necklaces out of pieces of popcorn, adding them to a big bowl. In the hall, Sue stands on a chair to put decorations on the tree. Willie stares, mesmerized by her backside, and begins fondling it. She pushes his hand away, so he reaches up and unzips the back of her skirt. She quickly does it back up and gives Willie a kiss. In the lounge, Grandma has conked out on the sofa. Sue carefully removes her slippers and then peels off her sheer, hold-up socks, handing one to Willie, and they pin the socks up at the fireplace. They exchange a smile and leave Grandma to slumber on. Later, Willie is at the front of the house lighting the candle bags Herb had come around organizing. Thurmond comes out of the house and walks over to Willie as one of the bags catches alight. Willie stamps out the blazing bag and looks around awkwardly. Thurmond looks down sadly, and Willie relents, bemusedly shaking his hand. Thurmond hurries off into the house, and Willie allows himself a faint smile. Once Thurmond is gone, Willie turns around and goes back to lighting the candle bags. In the mall, the security guard bids the last shoppers farewell. Lois is among the shoppers, making a show of looking at a price tag on a table laden with sweaters and, at the same time, pushing the table into a new position. She makes a minor adjustment to its position and heads off.",
    "1107": "As the evening sky is tinged red by the setting sun, the sun slowly sinks below the horizon. In the sprawling suburbs, the streets grow dark and the lights go on in the rows of houses, with a light shining from an upstairs window. In the bedroom, a dark-haired boy wearing round glasses is looking at an unusual photo album, and as he turns a page, the people in the photographs are moving and they smile at him. He turns to a snowy owl in a padlocked cage and Harry pulls a face. In the kitchen, his Aunt Petunia is decorating a meringue gateau while Uncle Vernon is fastening his son's bow tie. Dudley scowls at Harry knocking into him as he passes, and the three of them stare ominously at Harry. Harry goes upstairs as the guests arrive, finding a small wizened creature with floppy ears and a long pointed nose jumping on his bed. The creature is wearing a filthy rag and is banging his head. In Harry's bedroom, Dobby grabs a lamp and hits himself, and Uncle Vernon hears the noise upstairs and leaves. Vernon opens the wardrobe, and Dobby has a bundle of letters. Harry chases him downstairs, and Dobby stops at the kitchen door. On the table, stands the huge meringue gateau decorated with green and mauve whipped cream and red cherries. Dobby clicks his fingers, and the gateau rises into the air, then clicks his fingers again, and the gateau floats out of the kitchen. Horrified, Harry follows it into the sitting room where the creamy dessert hovers over Mrs. Mason. Dobby clicks his fingers, and the gateau falls on her head, covering Mrs. Mason in cake and cream. Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Vernon fixes bars outside Harry's window. Asleep in bed, Harry suddenly wakes. Looking puzzled, he reaches out for his glasses and puts them on. Getting out of bed, he goes across to the window and stares through the bars at the dark night sky. A faint light appears far away above the rooftops, gradually getting nearer, and to Harry's surprise, the light becomes two headlights of a blue Ford Anglia with a white roof that flies down over the neighboring gardens and hovers outside Harry's window. The lights disturb the snowy owl, and Harry stares at the three redhead boys in the car. Dressing quickly, Harry packs his trunk, and Ron fixes a hook to the bars on the window, wrenching them away. The Dursleys wake as the car boot flies open and Harry pushes his luggage out into it. Vernon unlocks the padlocks on Harry's door, and Harry passes Hedwig's cage to Ron. Harry dives for the window but Vernon grabs his foot as the car zooms away, and Vernon falls headfirst out of the window.",
    "1325": "Michael slowly turns around, and Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist with fingers tightening. In an instant, Michael moves like a blur, breaking the cop's arm and spinning him around to use as a human shield. Michael takes charge, holding a gun to Estevez's head and facing off with Burton as the street lamps begin to flicker and strobe, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his whole body quaking, and heels clicking the pavement, like some massive pressure is building inside him. His eyes snap open, focused, as the force inside him now takes control. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion, but Michael seems to know exactly who he's talking to. BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head, Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael is faster, already firing back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH! The squad car window shatters, Burton's chest explodes, and he goes down, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rises from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and loads them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and floors it, roaring away as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession, a wave chasing him and plunging the entire city into darkness. Jeep bolts awake, breathing hard and covered with sweat. He switches on a lamp, illuminating his incredibly cramped bedroom. He's got shaggy hair and a sensitive face, seemingly not fond of sunlight. A couple of ancient Silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments, looking like they haven't moved from this barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dots the trailers' roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors creaks open, and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. He gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness. He pauses, contemplating the sign, and then turns to see Charlie, a very pregnant girl about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway and rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She approaches Jeep, sees the strain in his eyes, and he struggles for a moment before nodding. A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face, but he turns away, dejected. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but she isn't on the same page. Jeep nods, trying to hide the fact that he's hurting inside. Bob Hansen, the late 40s owner and proprietor of this roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging on it.",
    "28": "Laszlo turns off the light and sits down on the couch next to her. It grows strained and a silence falls between them; Ilsa still cannot look at him. Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo, and he bends down and kisses her cheek. He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the window. She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again. The figure in the archway is gone. Ilsa gets a cloak from the bedroom and leaves the hotel room. Carl is busy figuring as Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. Carl looks up at Rick and laughs. Ilsa comes over to meet Rick, and he walks over to the window with Ilsa following. Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but finds it empty. There are tears in her eyes now, and he turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa. He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in her hand, pointed directly at him. He moves closer to her, and her hand drops down with tears in her eyes again. She turns and walks away from him, but Rick follows her and takes her in his arms, where she is lost in his embrace. He presses her tight to him and kisses her passionately. From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at the airport. Ilsa sits on the couch, and on a table before her rests a bottle of champagne along with two half-filled glasses. Rick walks over to her and sits down with Ilsa. Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder and snuggles closer to him. They run inside the entryway as the headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them, and the lights move past them. They flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection. Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward a side entrance of Rick's. Laszlo and Carl enter and cross toward the bar, out of breath from their exertion, as Carl goes behind the bar. Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door, opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light. Ilsa stands just in back of him and makes a move as if to go out to the balcony, but Rick pushes her back, and she withdraws behind the door. Rick walks out to the balcony railing and sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured. Both Carl and Laszlo look up as Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway and climbs the stairs. Carl enters Rick's apartment and sees Ilsa.",
    "473": "Mozart is suddenly delighted and throws the door wide open so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits, and he can see them. Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee, smiling and bowing uneasily as they include him in the small ovation. Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause. Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains. Salieri reads the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination, but suddenly the music snaps off as Mozart stands before him and lays down the score. Mozart takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room, while Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure. At a table sits Emperor Joseph II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform, surrounded by his Chamberlain Johann Von Strack, Count Orsini-Rosenberg, Baron Von Swieten, First Kapellmeister Giuseppe Bonno, and Salieri, who wears decorous black as usual. At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries use quill pens and inkstands to write down everything of importance that is said. Salieri looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg. In a somber room which serves as both a bedroom and a study, opposite an image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens, and ink. He occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing on an open forte-piano with some difficulty, scratching notes out with his quill and ruffling his hair without a powdered wig. The Salesman puts the second wig on Mozart's head, who pulls a face of doubt in the mirror and giggles. Mozart turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him, consisting of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten, and Salieri in a room containing several gilded chairs and a forte-piano. All bow and say, \"Good morning, Your Majesty.\" The Emperor produces a paper, goes to the instrument, sits, and plays the first bars of it, but plays a wrong note. Mozart throws himself to his knees and, to Joseph's discomfort, kisses the royal hand with fervour.",
    "768": "Nema stops the truck and climbs out. He looks back down the road to where Jackson stands with arms raised. They run to the truck. On the ground, Captain Michaels leads Anheuser's team across a walkway, where there are many other walkers with people crossing to the waiting arks. Nora sees them and addresses Anheuser. They spot the Saudi prince and his family. Anheuser walks off with Michaels, and Nora pats Adrian's shoulder and follows them. Crowds trudge along the Nampan Plateau, among them are Satnam and his family. They stop and look around to see a gigantic tsunami heading for the coastline. The huge waves tower over Satnam and head straight for the refugees. Adrian is shown into a cabin on the escape ship, glances around, picks up a goblet, and takes his ringing mobile from his bag. Leaving his phone switched on, Satnam crouches down and holds his son's face in his hands. They're deep in prayer as the tidal wave comes closer. Satnam and his wife hug their son between them as Adrian listens. Adrian throws away the goblet. On the Arc bridge, Adrian rushes across the bridge to Scottie. The images have been called up, and Adrian turns to Anheuser. They look at another screen, and Scottie hits a button. The old watch at the screen now reads 2 hours, 6 minutes, and 17 seconds. Anheuser turns away after moving his spectacles closer to a group of people sitting at another bank of monitors. A revised countdown appears on their screens. Nema drives the truck with his grandparents in the cab with him. In the back, Jackson is with his family, Gordon and Tamara. Little Noah lies asleep, his head resting on Gordon's shoulder. Gordon glances up and sees Jackson watching them, stares ahead, and speaks without looking at Jackson. He turns his head, and they pass a sign for utility gate 17 east. Nema stops the truck, and Tenzen opens the gate. Nema looks over his shoulder and nudges the kids forward. Kate spots Nema's grandma, and Tenzen glances up at Lily and Noah, then beckons them forward. Yuri and the others are in the ship bay. Yuri thumps the security guard as he looks behind, and the crowd pushes past and enters the bay. Yuri overlooks the arc as Tenzen leads Kate, Jackson, and the others towards the mountainside, which opens to reveal the ship bays. She calls on a passing science officer. Tenzen leads everyone up a launch tower staircase. On the bridge, Jackson and Noah head up the launch pad. Noah stares up at the anchors dangling from a gigantic ship's hull as the wind ruffles his hair. Jackson grabs Noah, and they hurry up towards the ark. The Russian President is led onto an ark bridge by his interpreter.",
    "745": "Elizabeth waves to Mae Mobley and drives off, and the little girl strokes Aibileen's cheek, prompting Aibileen to smile softly and kiss her on the cheek. They hug each other fondly. At a bus stop, several maids from the locality are climbing aboard, while Minnie, in a green straw hat and spotty dress, carrying a pie and a fan, peers out from the door of an empty bus. Seeing the coast is clear, she gets out, and Yule Mae, standing next to Aibileen, spots her. Minnie looks nonchalant as Skeeter strides up, and Aibileen glances behind her at the bus door closing, watching it drive off with a doom-laden look on her face. A white mother pushing a pram slows down as she passes. Aibileen takes the slip of paper and then trudges off. Skeeter studies a State of Mississippi pamphlet on the conduct of non-white and other minorities while Aibileen's voice reads the words. Aibileen answers as Minnie, with her pie, rings Hilly's doorbell, and Hilly eyes the pie, loftily indicating she should wait. Minnie's face stiffens, and she sinks to the floor. Aibileen rings off, her eyes lighting on the paper with Skeeter's number propped up on the phone. In a church, young Preacher Green invites the choir to stand, and Aibileen thinks on his words. Later at home, Aibileen hurries to the door and ushers Skeeter in, inviting her to follow to the sitting room of her spotless little house. Skeeter sits down on the sofa and unties the headscarf she's wearing while Aibileen stays standing, dressed in a yellow dress with elbow-length sleeves and a scalloped detail down the front, pursing her lips with a faint sigh. Visibly nervous, she pours tea from a white china pot into a china cup, spilling a drop on the saucer. A silver spoon on a white napkin is set next to the cup, and there's also a plate of jam tarts. As Skeeter takes hold of the cup, Aibileen hastily wipes up the spill in the saucer and, smoothing the back of her dress, sits on the arm of an easy chair facing Skeeter. At the kitchen table, Skeeter reads from a list of questions as Aibileen looks mournfully at the photograph of the graduate student, and Skeeter follows her gaze. Aibileen turns away to face the window, blanked out by the strong sun outside, puts down the cutlery she's holding, and nods mutely, seeming to conduct an internal dialogue with herself. Skeeter carefully considers the proposal as Aibileen produces a notebook and her reading glasses, standing in front of Skeeter with the notebook open in her hands. Cracking a brief smile, she sits back down, and they stifle their giggles. Sometime later, Skeeter puts her notes in her briefcase.",
    "1328": "Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an inhuman scream and scrambles across the diner, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter, and Gladys smiles sweetly before slapping him clear across the room. The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet, and he snatches it up and aims at Gladys, who turns calmly to face him. Jeep is about to fire when the old lady's eyes go all white, and he freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelmed with fear that paralyzes him. Gladys rockets straight at him, but Jeep is too afraid to move and clamps his eyes shut, bracing for the end. A rain of bullets rip into Gladys, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes, his gun still cocked, and sees Gladys lying dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver-plated Western Arms 45. Sandra is on the floor with her husband, blood pouring freely from his neck. Kyle stares at the dying man, hesitates for a moment, and then rushes to help. Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit, and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck. A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet. Kyle shoots him a look, and they realize it's pedal-to-the-floor time for the eighty miles ahead. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. Up ahead, the dark clouds Jeep saw earlier have closed in, descending onto the highway like a wall. They are black and undulating, and suddenly hundreds of tiny bugs begin to hit the windshield. That's when they realize those aren't clouds. The Escalade enters the swarm, and the car is pummeled by insects, the windshield instantly covered in black and red bug guts. Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking as if he's about to puke or faint, and Bob, noticing Jeep trembling, rests a hand on his shoulder but cannot get the words out. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front door. Bob and Jeep appear from the back as Kyle, Percy, Audrey, and Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling and gasping for air, while Charlie moves in to help and Percy races for the back. Bob, Kyle, and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body, wrapped in the plastic tablecloth, a short way from the diner, warily eyeing the curtain of flies no more than a hundred yards out.",
    "110": "A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much like Forrest's, looks up from his seat, and Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit down. Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief, and they shake hands. Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room and sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. Bubba's grandmother also carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room and sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man while the recruits sit at the base of their bunks assembling their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest as Forrest finishes assembling his rifle while the other recruits are still working on theirs. The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest, looks at his stopwatch, and then walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble his rifle. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in his slow southern drawl as Bubba and Forrest shine their boots. They are on their hands and knees scrubbing the floor with toothbrushes. Later, Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly, and Forrest also lies in his bunk and looks up. A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest, who picks it up and turns the page, revealing Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all. Forrest looks up with shock, cranes his head up for a closer look, then in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the club. The EMCEE steps out onto the stage, and the men laugh. Jenny kicks a man's hand, and he yells angrily as he sits back down, then tosses his drink on her. Forrest walks up to the man and grabs him, tossing him to the ground. Another man tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest shoves him down too. Forrest climbs up onto the stage, picks Jenny up, guitar and all, and carries her, but Jenny struggles and frees herself. Forrest steps back in surprise, and Jenny shoves the guitar at him. Jenny walks off as Forrest holds the guitar and follows after her. Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the nightclub, and Jenny turns and looks over the bridge, then at the light of an approaching vehicle. She steps into the street, runs, and flags down the approaching vehicle. A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver, walks toward Forrest, looks at the driver again, and then walks up to Forrest. Jenny takes a last look at Forrest and then climbs into the truck.",
    "751": "People are reflected in the mirror of a shop changing room, peering in nervously as Dr. Mathison sits beside a black woman who's lying down, gazing into a blanket wrapped bundle. The women smiles at the wriggling bundle as the doctor gently lifts it and looks inside. Still reflected in the mirror, the doctor looks up at the saleswoman and then back at the baby, frowning. A man is leaning against a train window, staring out as the train pulls away from a station. He straightens up, leans back in his seat, wearing a dark gray suit, with the top button of his pale green shirt undone and his tie loosely knotted. The little hair he has is close shaved, leaving just a dark shadow. Glancing between the seats in front of him, he sees a little girl lying almost upside down, staring back at him. He grins at her, but the grin fades, and he leans towards the window again, rubbing the inside corner of one eye wearily. A slim woman in her late 20s, wearing a blue top, stretches up to place her coat on the overhead rack, and as she does, the top parts company with her black trousers, and the man gazes at her exposed white midriff and the section of ivy tattoo climbing through the gap between top and trousers. He flirtively slips off his wedding ring and drops it into his jacket pocket. The young woman sits down, glances at some leaflets, drops them in the seat pocket, straightens her shoulder-length brown hair, tucks down her top, sits back, and closes her eyes. The man looks down at the seat pocket in front of him, stretches forward, and picks up a magazine, then picks up a second magazine, looks at it himself before passing it to her. The man looks down, swallows, and looks at her again, watching another train pass and looking down before turning to her again. They shake hands, but she looks down at the magazine again, then up at him with her smile gone. She folds and unfolds her arms, tucks her fist under her chin, and shows him her wedding ring. She stands, picks up the leaflets, and moves down the aisle of the train, and his head drops. He pulls his wedding ring from his pocket, hesitates for a moment before slipping it back on, and settles back in his seat. Glancing between the seat backs, David sees a little girl in front sitting up now, her blonde hair pulled off her face and held by yellow clips, watching him and smiling. He moves out of her sight towards the window and leans against it frowning slightly, his eyes closing, while outside, trees and shrubs form a green backdrop along the track side.",
    "75": "We stay on the house at leisure, hearing him lunging, shoulder to door, and the squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood, creating an ultra romantic image of shelter and peace. Frogs or river noises are heard off-screen, followed by the rattle of running footsteps as the children, their backs to us, sprint towards the boat through a light mist as in the previous shot. We shoot over Bess's turned photograph of Birdie, close, passed out in his rocker while the children run through the open door in the background and John runs up to Birdie. John grabs Birdie's shoulder; Birdie half-rises and falls face down on the floor, then rears on one elbow and looks up at John before falling face down again. John grabs Birdie by one ear, turning his face up, and Birdie looks earnestly at John. John masterfully takes Pearl by the hand and leads her into the night. We shoot from the river as they struggle through the sumac and pokeberry weeds at the edge of the river towards the skiff, whose prow, tethered to a willow, is seen throughout this unmoving shot at our extreme right. When they come opposite the skiff, which is a few yards out from shore, Pearl, frankly bored, dangles her doll and yawns as John, finishing undoing the rope from a willow root, looks up and around, checking on pursuit. On the bank above, in the mist, a man, the Preacher, goes along a river lane on horseback, walking the horse away from us. We descend to a poor riverside farmhouse where John and Pearl tether a boat in front of it, eat hot boiled potatoes, glance at each other, and turn away towards the lane in the background. John and Pearl proceed towards the house, and we shoot from within the open door of the kitchen as they advance to the edge of the porch where a tired farm woman stands by the door within. We shoot over her, and she leaves the shot briefly (we hold on the children), re-enters, and goes to them with a bowl of steaming potatoes. They take hands-full and make to eat, turn away, and walk towards the boat as she looks after them. Preacher stands behind the flames, in the foreground an old man sits profiled on a box, other workers, all men, sit around the fire, resulting in a short silence as they look at Preacher without liking. The old man spits into the fire, creating a spurt of steam as the spit strikes. He comes down to the water with a full landscape in the background, and we shoot over two sitting rabbits as they watch, their ears up. The skiff passes with Pearl playing with a doll and John unsnarling a line. The skiff passes again, and we pan in a big barn near the river, then to a lighted house; willows line the shore.",
    "1123": "Even Ginny Weasley refuses to catch his eye. Harry puts down his quill and closes his book. He gets up from the table and puts his books under his arm, sensing that all the students are staring at him as he quickly walks out of the room. In the corridor, Harry hears the disembodied voice again and follows the sound. Harry looks around nervously and, taking a deep breath, walks slowly around a corner, stopping at the horrible sight ahead of him. Lit by flaming torchlight, he sees the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a boy, Justin, lying petrified on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms stuck out in front of him. Harry kneels beside Justin and touches his stiff fingers. Filch the caretaker appears stealthily behind him. Still kneeling beside the petrified Justin, Harry notices a line of spiders quickly scuttling across the floor. They follow each other up the wall, over the stone windowsill, and out of the open window. As Harry watches them go, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall, who hurries along the corridor towards Harry and regards the scene with horror. She walks briskly away, and Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch burning on each side. Filling the archway is a huge stone statue of a griffin, with the head and outstretched wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long fingers and points them at the statue, which slowly turns, and Harry steps onto the circular staircase behind it. As the griffin continues to revolve, Harry is gradually carried upwards. At the top, he steps off and walks down a passage towards a large wooden door leading to a cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets, the walls hung with moving portraits of elderly wizards. The heavy wooden door swings open, and Harry peers cautiously inside. Harry walks up some steps into a smaller room lined with shelves of old books. On one of the shelves high above his head, he catches sight of a patched and shabby pointed hat. As he stares at the crumpled hat, it starts to speak. The hat scowls, and Harry turns as he hears a faint sound. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers is balancing on a perch. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly bursts into flames. Harry takes a step back as the bird becomes a pile of ash below its perch. Dumbledore appears at the top of a flight of stairs just as a tiny head pokes out from the pile of black ash, and the baby bird opens its beak.",
    "414": "Ben watches it. Ben's face is shown as he watches. He continues watching, and the scene pulls back to reveal that they are in the Taft Hotel Room. Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against the headboard, watching the television set on a stand facing the bed. The camera pulls back to a wide shot of the room, lit only by the light from the television set. Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot, half dressed, passing between Ben and the television set and then going out of frame. Ben continues to stare at the set as Mrs. Robinson appears again, passing the other way, and then passes back again. Now fully dressed and carrying her purse, Mrs. Robinson passes through once more and, without looking at Ben, goes to the hotel room door, opens it, and exits; the sound of the door closing is heard. Follow Ben as he gets up and moves to the windows of what is now his bedroom in the Braddock house. He opens the closed blinds over the window, revealing a bright sun outside. His bathing suit is on the window sill, and he takes it and puts it on. Ben moves to the bedroom door, opens it, and goes out. Mrs. Braddock is seen in the kitchen as Ben comes through the back door, moves to the pool, and dives in. The raft floats in the center of the pool as Ben swims toward us the length of the pool, then surfaces and, in one movement, pulls himself up on the raft, landing on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed. He stays on top of her for a moment, then turns toward us and looks, where Mr. Braddock is standing by the side of the pool with the sun behind him. Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock, followed by Mr. Robinson, and they blot out the sun as Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them. There is a long pause. The door opens and Mrs. Robinson enters, stopping to look at Ben, raising her eyebrows. Ben thinks for a moment and looks at her, as she pulls the covers down. He starts putting on his shirt while she sits on the edge of the bed, watching him and shaking her head. There is another long pause. Without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes at opposite sides of the room. Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box, with Mr. and Mrs. Braddock also present. Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading. He slides off the raft and goes underwater, his hair streaming up and his eyes open. Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.",
    "987": "Frowning, Benjamin plants his hands on the armrests of his chair and labors determinedly to stand up. He adjusts his leg with his hands. Benjamin stands, then collapses. The preacher points both hands at Benjamin. Benjamin struggles to his feet and stands shakily before the congregation. His posture's crooked. He takes a step. The congregation clap and cheer him on. The preacher freezes with his arms held aloft. Two concerned men rise sharply, and the preacher keels over. A white-robed pianist starts to play. The flag outside flies at half-mast. Music plays from a gramophone beside a grave. Benjamin, Queenie, and Tizzy are amongst the mourners. As the song ends, a man claps two cymbals together. An old guy. Benjamin eavesdrops on a conversation. Benjamin hobbles on crutches to the back door to watch Mr. Oti holding court in the garden. He turns to see Benjamin, who ducks out of sight. Indoors, diminutive, sharp-suited Mr. Oti takes a seat beside Benjamin. Benjamin turns gingerly to meet his gaze. The black African, Mr. Oti, smiles. Outside, on the sunny street, Mr. Oti tips his hat to one of three children playing baseball. Wearing a large, ill-fitting fedora, Benjamin struggles to keep up with him on crutches. Mr. Oti waves to a tram. On board, Bushman shares a cage with apes. He bares his teeth at three children in the whites-only section of the tram. They cower. They sit on a bench by tall stone columns. Benjamin presses his lips together and looks away, thoughtfully. Benjamin smiles at Mr. Oti, then looks away again. Benjamin sips root beer. They approach a woman in town. Oti hugs her. Dwarfed by Philomena, Mr. Oti walks away. Alone, Benjamin fails to reach a tram in time. He waves a crutch in the air as the tram glides off. Benjamin cuts a forlorn figure as he plods away. Night, Benjamin determinedly makes his way down a sidewalk. As he arrives at the familiar clapboard retirement home, Queenie lifts a sash window and stares down at him. At a basin. She goes and he stares at his wet, blistered hands. On the lawn, Benjamin turns to see a man watching him from the street. The man, his father, Thomas, gets into the back of a car. An elegant, gray-haired woman. The girl pirouettes. Benjamin sits with Oti, Philomena, Miss Fuller, and Daisy. Queenie takes Tizzy's hand. Miss Fuller reads to Daisy from an illustrated storybook. Benjamin sits with them. Night, age six, with long red hair, Daisy approaches Benjamin's bed. He sits up. She beckons him. Benjamin hobbles down a flight of stairs in the dark. Table linen has been thrown over some tables and chairs to form a tent.",
    "840": "He looks at his phone as his co-worker enters, and later, he approaches his co-worker in the garage. More co-workers step out and include Sandy in a circle, and wide-eyed, Sandy glances at his co-workers. Staring down, a smile creeps across Sandy's face as he considers, then he raises his gaze and nods. Now, Sandy's daughter kicks a soccer ball off a field, and her mother cheers from the sidelines. Sandy approaches his wife, who jumps back with surprise, and he speaks to her with his hands gently holding her face. Holding her hand over her mouth, she jumps with joy and gives Sandy a hug, then he smiles and lifts her off her feet. Now, the plump identity thief sips from a straw as she rides down an escalator; at a store, she tries on a ring, now in cosmetics, and two women laugh as they watch the cosmetics girl apply makeup to the redhead. At a cell phone kiosk, the man smiles. At the center of the mall, a mother and daughter sit on a jet ski, and the redhead buys it. At a Brookstone, she sleeps on a massage chair with her open mouth drooling, and an employee approaches, pokes her, then she sorts through a stack of Sandy's cards. Now, Sandy and his daughters brush their teeth, and in his car, Sandy smiles and bobs his head as he taps his thumbs on the steering wheel. He glances down at the dashboard, where the low-gas light blinks on, and his smile fades as he pulls into a gas station. At the pump, Sandy puts in his credit card, holds the card to his mouth, breathes on the strip, then wipes the card on his jacket and pushes the card in again. Inside, the attendant stands behind a clear protective glass, talking on an earpiece; the attendant swipes the card and talks into his earpiece, then points to his earpiece and slides Sandy the cut card. Now, in Sandy's car, a police car pulls up behind him, and officers emerge from the cruiser; Sandy peeks out the window as one of the officers approaches while the other officer stands back with his hand by his sidearm. The detective touches his phone, and now the detective returns with a file and hands Sandy the thief's haggard mug shot, leaving Sandy shaking his head. Now, the family man parks a Subaru, enters a modern office and passes a company logo, goes to a glass door, and pushes it open. He admires his new office as his former coworker, now new boss, approaches, and four cops stand at reception. Later, as men put lids on boxes, the lead detective approaches Sandy and his boss; Sandy faces his boss, who turns to the detective.",
    "935": "Holmes sees a stack of long-barreled pistols and is handed a magazine to load, but identical thugs come up behind him, one grabbing the gun and the other holding a piece of cloth over Holmes' mouth and nose, causing his eyes to close as he sinks to the floor. Watson returns to the spot where he left Holmes and finds a note pinned to a crate, reading it and turning it over to see Rene's sketch of a tall tower. He glances up at a lit tower nearby and moves off. Meanwhile, a small glass with liquid is held under Holmes' nose, and he stirs. Watson goes nearer to the tower as Moriarty turns to Holmes. A guard had apprehended Watson, but Moran shot the guard to get an aim on Watson. A meat hook is slammed into Holmes' shoulder, and he's hauled up on a rope. Moriarty lowers a stylus on a gramophone record, holding a telephone in front of the horn speaker, broadcasting the music over a speaker into the yard where Watson cowers in the darkness while Moran keeps a rifle trained from a walkway high up on the tower. Moriarty accompanies the singer, and Holmes, clutching the rope attached to the hook in his shoulder, is swinging about a meter off the floor. Moriarty pushes him, and Moran shoots at Watson, but the bullet ricochets off a metal pole. Moriarty spins Holmes around, and Watson breaks cover as Moran shoots, causing Watson to duck behind a platform. Holmes' screams are audible over the tenor as Watson climbs a ladder on the platform. Holmes spins in the air while Moran takes aim, his shot passing through a narrow gap between pieces of machinery, just missing Watson. Moriarty indicates to a henchman to lower Holmes to the ground as Watson holds his hat up to the gap in the machinery, and Moran puts a bullet straight through it. Watson looks around and sees a pair of ear defenders hanging on the wall. Moriarty rolls his eyes wearily and bends over Holmes, gripping the meat hook embedded in his shoulder with one hand and Holmes' uninjured arm with the other. Moran watches the piece of machinery, and a cover falls off it, revealing an artillery cannon. Moran retreats, desperately climbing down the tower to escape from the cannon Watson is operating. Watson fires the cannon at the tower, which collapses, smashing through the roof of the building where Holmes and Moriarty are. As the dust settles, Watson sits up on the platform wearing the ear defenders, climbs down from the platform, and runs over to the now ruined building, searching through the debris and finding Holmes half-buried under the rubble.",
    "74": "The narrative starts by approaching a riverside village and centering on an open touring car as it drives along a river road. We stoop low towards the car's driver, who is dressed in dark clothes, a paper collar, and a string tie. As he drives, he talks to himself, nods, smiles, and touches his hat, thinking of a widow with a hidden stash of bills in a sugar-bowl. He shifts into second gear, climbing a steep little hill, with the stones of a country graveyard gleaming in the last daylight. He starts fast and noisily down a steep hill while she works hard in the presence of off-screen music. In contrast to the sad burlesque audience, he stands out with a sour and aggressive expression. The camera moves in for a head close-up, focusing on his hand labeled H-A-T-E in tattoo across four knuckles. He slides his hand into his pocket before the labeling is seen. His head slants into a cold smile and one eyelid flutters. A hand descends onto his shoulder, and he glances up behind him as he bends down to speak quietly into the preacher’s ear. The scene shifts to a grim stone-turreted façade with an American flag idling at the top center. Two children, John, who is nine, and Pearl, who is five, sit in the grass in a sentimental picture. They work together on Pearl's doll with John struggling to get on a difficult shoe but eventually proudly exhibits the shod foot. They look off-screen and get up with Pearl dangling the doll. A Model-T Ford approaches rapidly on an uneven dirt road and careens towards them, swinging into the side yard as the camera pans and stops. Ben Harper half-falls out of the far door with a blood-stained shoulder and wild eyes, looking dazedly across the car at them. A hefty, simple man of thirty, he emerges clear of the car with a revolver in one hand and a bloody roll of banknotes in the other. As he moves forward, two police cars appear in the distance, coming fast with sirens. Ben and his children become smaller in the distance as police cars approach in the background. Pearl hugs her doll while in the background, troopers exit their cars, fanning out cautiously to surround Ben with guns in hand. Ben backs away from his children, raising his hands with a gun in one hand. The camera pulls back to enlarge the group shot, showing the role of the troopers. Two troopers approach Ben from behind. He runs forward, clasps his stomach with his mouth open, and one trooper smacks the back of Ben's head with a pistol barrel.",
    "1318": "It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Marcus' van. The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside him. Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes. Willie wears a forbearing smile. He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty red Santa sack. Marcus stares. Jesse, the security guard, unlocks the door and opens up for Willie and Marcus. They enter in costume. Willie lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining. As Willie and Marcus enter the store, Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags. Willie drops the bag with a loud thud. Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling. He gets up and walks away. Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless. Bob Chipeska sits opposite. A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall. Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid. Willie follows. Willie enters. He goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical Kid yanks away. As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say. Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand. The Kid shrieks. Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team. Willie sees off another child. Willie stares at him. Marcus returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting stone-faced. Marcus sighs. Gin leaves. Willie's eyes do not leave the spot in space. The Kid turns to go. Willie beckons him. He displays an envelope. The Kid's eye is indeed black and blue. He reaches self-consciously up to it. Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait. Marcus stares at him. Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs. She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs. Lois is in the driver's seat. Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down. SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van. He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises the hood. The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood. Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals.",
    "162": "He holds up his hand for attention and forces a smile, then starts reading. It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way. Gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but just as colorlessly. This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction. Three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them. He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both now. He holds it up. A constable glances at the police sergeant. And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire. The flames engulf it. The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief. The crowd murmurs in shock. At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture. He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd. It is the end of the speech. He looks at the crowd. Gandhi harrumphs -- gesturing to a shallow box Singh holds. Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely. He is facing the crowd. Behind him, Khan holds himself erect and slowly takes his own card from his pocket. He holds it aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket. The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame. He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon. As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club menacingly against his hand. Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from Singh and moves to the fire. Gandhi is at the fire. For a second, his eyes lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket, and another. Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him. Gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket. The sergeant's fury bursts -- and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head. Gandhi sags to the ground. Ba screams. She starts to run to him, but the other women seize her.",
    "881": "She leads Kate by the hand to a picnic laid out on the lounge floor. Sitting on cushions in front of a roaring fire, under a sheet stretched out like a safari tent, the trio share the pizza. Zoe pretends to be an elephant, and the three then play pick-up sticks with bread sticks. By the light of several candles, Zoe acts out a charade as wax drips down tall candlesticks beside a half-empty cafetiere of coffee. Zoe fast asleep on a cushion, Nick crawls round to her and lifts her from the floor. His shadow casts on the side of the sheet tent as he carries her out, while Kate takes out a small tray with two espresso cups on it. She pauses to look down the hallway and watch Nick gently carry Zoe to her bedroom before turning back and staring ahead thoughtfully. Later, the pair are tidying up when Nick opens the fridge and takes out the Tupperware box Kate found in his bag. They sit on the lounge floor with a tiramisu between them; Kate's face brightens as she tastes a spoonful. The candles and firelight illuminate the room as Nick moves across to sit beside Kate, reaching out to wipe a spot of cream from the right side of her mouth, and licks the cream from his finger, gazing intently at her. Kate's face is turned towards Nick, but she looks away briefly and nods. He reaches behind Kate and moves nearer, lips almost touching, she leans back against his arm. Kate shifts awkwardly as Nick puts on his scarf and stands, picks up his jacket from the back of the sofa, and puts it on as he enters the darkened kitchen to retrieve his pants. Kate smiles serenely to herself. At the therapist, he spins around in his leather chair, and Kate furrows her brow. Kate joins the headmistress in her spacious office, then leaves. In the park, Zoe is walking on the benches, then runs off, leading Kate to chase after her. Zoe narrowly avoids being hit by a Yellow Cab as she runs across a busy road, and Kate dodges the traffic to follow her, but ultimately steps back and watches helplessly as Zoe runs off. Later, Zoe is on her bed looking at the photo album, and as she flicks through it, she finds a peacock feather like the one she was playing with shortly before the car crash and sighs, her eyes welling with tears. Kate goes down to Sean's apartment where, in the dark and deserted kitchen, she and Nick share a plate of food and drink red wine across the serving counter, talking happily together. Finally, in the pouring rain, Nick dashes out of his truck outside Kate's apartment building.",
    "1278": "Stars drift slowly in the blackness of space and a moon glows silver in the darkness, seen from the mountainous surface of the Earth. Letters form around the moon, and a circle of reflected sunlight and the Earth form the two Os. In 1928, a blizzard lashes the Karakoram mountains in India. In a tent, a candle glows in a lantern, and a cup of snow is placed on a gas burner. Climbing spikes are sharpened, and wind tears at the canvas walls of the tent. A light shines outside, then goes dark, and a bearded climber looks puzzled. He emerges from the tent in thick furs with a climbing ax and a rope wrapped around him, and he pulls on goggles to protect his eyes. Beams of light radiate skywards from behind a rocky ridge as the climber carefully ascends a snowy slope and inches up a near vertical cliff. He plunges his ice ax into the rock and hauls himself up over the edge of the rock face, standing slowly upright and moving forward as the wind howls around him. He moves on, steadying himself with the ice ax, raising his goggles to stare at a glowing ball embedded in the snowy rock. Lights pulse inside the orb as he approaches it, closing on the object, which is about 10 feet high, with a crystalline surface and shadows and lights swirling inside. He reaches out a laser mutant hand on the orb and slowly runs his hand over the surface, eyes narrowed above his snow-crusted dark beard, then raises the eye axe. Light shines out as he breaks the crystalline crust, squinting at the intensity of the swirling brilliance within. He is enveloped in a brilliant light of overwhelming intensity, and the eye sac lies on the snow as the climber lies next to it, his eyes closed. He awakens and rises slowly, seats up, and looks around. There is a spherical hole in the snowy rock face, but the orb is gone. The climber looks at his right hand, finding the mitten has a hole in it. He removes it, revealing a round coin-sized scar on the back of his hand, frowns, and checks his palm, too. He seats on the snow-covered rocky ground and looks skywards through the swirling snow. An object seen through an electron microscope appears on a screen. The tutor is slim, with dark hair tied in a ponytail, and she smiles hesitantly. Cars stream across an arched iron bridge over a river as the tutor drives a small silver hatchback. A computer game character has a sword across his back, and Jacob has got long dark curly hair. The tutor, his guardian, is white, and Jacob is black. She crosses to the bed where he's concentrating on the game and sits beside him.",
    "1221": "The volunteer looks down on Rambo's boat where Lewis stands in the stern with his back to Rambo. Lewis points to himself and looks at Rambo, who ignores him. Rambo fixes him a glare but remains expressionless, then turns away and spits into the river before staring ahead again as Lewis walks away in disgust. Handsome and rugged School Boy glances up the boat at Rambo. The military camp at night has a truck sitting at the end of two rows of huts. In the pigsty cell, Sarah looks up through the floorboards into the hut where the commander appears, with a short, neat mustache, takes a pull on one of his ever-present cigarettes, blows smoke, smirks, and walks away as Sarah rests her head against the wall of her prison. On the river, the boat rounds a promontory with its headlamps off. Lewis leans pensively on the boat's prow, turns to look at the stern, and Rambo stares back at him before Lewis turns away. The boat pulls alongside the harbor where Michael's party were dropped, and the mercenaries disembark laden with various weapons and bandoleers, including automatic rifles with telescopic sights. Two rebels approach along the path leading to the gangplank as Rambo walks up the gangplank. The party of mercenaries, BN the rebel, and the boy tracker set off into the forest while Rambo solemnly watches them go, turns away, and walks back to the boat. BN and the boy lead the mercenaries through forest undergrowth as School Boy's rifle is particularly bulky, and they cross a small stream. En-Joo wears a khaki hat, and Diaz has a shirt covering his hair. Resting against a tree and partially covered in vines is a dull gray object, bullet-shaped but with fins at one end, which Lewis regards warily, while the rest of the mercenaries pay the bomb little attention and move on. They pass a cave mouth on a craggy mountainside where inside there's a small collection of nervous-looking locals, comprising women, children, and old men, and the mercenaries move on as En-Joo, Reese, and Diaz each give the locals a backward glance. At the village paddy field, the water is clear but there is pale brown mud beneath it, with sticks of plant poking into the air and trees reflected in the water's surface. A decomposing human corpse lies partially submerged in the water with a dead buffalo beyond it, as BN and the mercenaries overlook the field. More corpses lie at the edge of the field, and Reese holds his shirt against his nose as a woman's severed head hangs from a post. Lewis turns to look, and there are two bodies hanging from bare rafters in the remains of a hut. The boy nods and leaves, and the mercenaries make a wary record of the ruined village.",
    "713": "Jack points toward the settee, and Rose steps to the settee, then stretches out on it. Rose drapes one arm along the back of the settee, lays her hand on the pillow behind her head, and places her right hand near her temple. Smiling, Rose lowers her head and licks her lips. Jack peers over the top of his sketchpad, draws a line, and, looking from the paper to Rose, he sketches. Jack grins as he draws, runs his charcoal across the paper creating faint arcs, jerks his head to toss his hair out of his eyes, and adds details as he fleshes out the sketch. Jack smiles as he darkens a shadow under Rose's breasts, while Rose gazes at Jack as he draws. With his finger, Jack rubs various parts of the charcoal drawing, including Rose's hand, forehead, and face. Rose stares expressionless, and gradually, wrinkles form around her eyes, and she transforms into her older self. The crew members and Rose's granddaughter, Lizzie, stare at her, and Brock and Lizzie exchange smiles. Jack signs and dates the drawing, then blows on it, closes his sketchbook, and hands it to Rose. They kiss. Later, Rose writes on a sheet of paper, and Jack steps up to her. She hands him the case holding the Heart of the Ocean. Jack walks into the next room and slides the case into the safe. In the first-class smoking room, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands, as the Titanic moves slowly. On the bridge, the helmsman turns the ship's wheel as a ship's officer steps up to Captain Smith, who looks down as he stirs a slice of lemon in his tea, then walks off. Stepping back into Rose's suite, he blows on his hands, and wearing an evening dress, Rose joins him. Rose grabs Jack and pulls him through the sitting room toward a door. Lovejoy steps into the suite as Rose and Jack hurry into Rose's bedroom, and Rose closes the door. Lovejoy strides through the sitting room as Jack and Rose step through another door into a corridor. Lovejoy bursts into another room as Jack and Rose hurry down the corridor. Lovejoy opens a door and glimpses Jack and Rose, who walk faster, prompting Lovejoy to follow them. Jack and Rose run to an elevator, dash into the elevator, and the operator slides the grate shut. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator and slams his hands against the grate, and as the elevator descends, Lovejoy glares through glass at them. Rose raises her middle finger, then waves, and Lovejoy hurries to the staircase. The elevator opens, and Rose and Jack spill out as Lovejoy runs down a staircase while Jack and Rose scramble from the bottom of a different staircase. Jack bumps onto a food table.",
    "1382": "As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick and pokes a knot on the trunk, instantly calming the Willow. We look upward, seeing the tops of the trees etched against the darkening sky. Bats fly toward us, and we follow one as Buckbeak snags it, a tail twitching briefly between his beak before it disappears with a slurp. Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening shadows, and Hermione looks at Harry, nodding and not wanting to press him further, then glances beyond the trees toward the Whomping Willow. Shadows emerge under a full moon, revealing Black, Harry, Pettigrew, Lupin, Hermione, Ron, and Sleepwalking Snape. Harry studies himself and Sirius. Hermione glances toward the Willow, and Harry looks back to the tall grass as the werewolf is frozen. As a chill wind rises and the leaves of the trees tremble, eerie shadows flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke, revealing Dementors. Hermione eyes Harry warily as he is transfixed, staring hungrily toward the outcrop. The lake begins to freeze, and one after another, Dementors drop from the sky, vanishing in the cyclone. Desperately, Hermione's eyes flash to the cyclone and the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the water's edge, dying. Harry's face changes, and he draws his wand, slashing through the trees down to the rocky outcrop, the exact spot where his father appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of Dementors on the other side of the lake. A wisp of silver escapes his wand, hovering like a mist, then blooms magnificently, and the trees explode with light. The lake blazes with reflected fire, and Harry stands utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the lake, the Dementors retreat, and Harry waits, still as a statue, until each one is gone before simply letting his arm drop. Whoosh! Harry and Hermione plunge into frame astride Buckbeak, soaring toward the castle. Hermione contemplates this as Sirius paces within a small cell, a man condemned, but he is stunned to see them. Ka-boom! The cell door rockets to the sky. Black claps Harry's shoulder, looking him in the eye, and with a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the door as Harry and Hermione enter, catching the faintest glimpse of themselves across the room just as they evaporate. Ron blinks, turns, frowns, then glances to the other side of the room. Hermione glances mischievously to Harry, who jumps. Lupin turns, smiling through haggard eyes, as the Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk. Harry nods, looks back at Lupin, unable to disguise his shock at Lupin's appearance, and eyes the open desk drawers and the bare bookshelves.",
    "806": "Ferris pulls himself free and clambers over the wall. He makes a call as he limps across wasteland. Skip parks the BMW on a busy street, and he and Ferris get out. They walk into a health clinic. In a treatment room, Ferris sits up on a bed. A doctor attends to him. The doctor leaves, and the pretty young nurse, Aisha, walks in. She gets a packet from a cabinet and goes to Ferris. She looks at the deep, bloody bites on Ferris' leg. She looks at his bloody hands and cut arm. He smiles, and she prepares a syringe. She walks around to him, smiling. Ferris studies her as she holds up the syringe and flicks it. He winces as she injects him in the stomach. He calls Hoffman. Hoffman gets in his car next to his daughter. Two men in suits open gates, and the Mercedes drives into a courtyard. It stops behind another car which Hani is leaning against, smoking. Ferris gets out of the Mercedes looking a little apprehensive. He walks up to Hani. He throws his cigarette away. Hani leads Ferris along a corridor. Hani goes to a door with a window in it and knocks on the glass. On the other side, a man lowers a flap, and Ferris looks into the room. Hoffman's agent, Zayed Ibishi, is naked and tied down on a table. A man whips him. Ferris turns away. Ferris watches the flogging, his eyes narrowed. A young man wearing a black kufi wheels a bicycle with heavily laden panniers out onto a street. He stops by some bins, lifts the lid of one of them, and takes out two paper cups. He takes a piece of paper from one of the cups. The young man wheels his bicycle away. Noordermarkt. A bustling, covered marketplace. People are crowded in the street and around flower stalls. A young man with his black hair swept back locks a car, then notices a tourist lining up a photograph. Head down, the man briskly walks past the tourist, pressing the keys of a mobile phone. The car explodes, sending shock waves through the marketplace. Black and white frame-by-frame images of the explosion, which is blanked out by static. Smoke hangs over the marketplace. Ferris, in his apartment, and Hani, at home with his wife, watch the news. Al-Saleem watches the report. Ferris meets Marwan. Ferris looks at Hani, who's sitting in his car. Ferris sits in the back next to Hani, and Marwan shuts the door. They drive across the desert in a convoy of black cars. The photos Ferris showed Hani. On a vast expanse of brown earth, a suited man stands beside a kneeling figure, whose head is covered with a black hood.",
    "115": "Neff sits before the dictaphone. Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. As he walks towards his office, he runs into Keyes, who is wearing his vest and hat but no coat. Keyes is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar. He stops by a majolica jar filled with sand, takes a pencil from his vest, and stands over the jar, extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it, then puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. They move on and stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium: EDWARD S. NORTON, JR., PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door and they go in. As Keyes and Neff enter, the door to Norton's private office opens, and Mr. Norton is letting out three legal-looking gentlemen. Norton, who is about forty-five, very well-groomed, and rather pompous in manner, sees Keyes and Neff. Neff puts down his hat and briefcase, and he and Keyes pass the legal-looking men and follow Norton into his office, which is naturally the best in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, and very well furnished, including flowers, smoking stands, and easy chairs. Norton has gone behind his desk, and after Keyes comes in, Neff closes the door quietly. Norton disapprovingly looks at Keyes in shirt sleeves and smiles frostily. Keyes and Neff sit down while Norton remains standing and walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard. There is a charged pause as he looks back and forth between Keyes and Neff. The dictograph on his desk buzzes, and he reaches over to depress a key and puts the earpiece to his ear, then replaces it and turns back to Keyes and Neff. Keyes and Neff start to get up just as the secretary opens the door. Neff stands staring at the door and then relaxes with an obvious effort of will as Phyllis comes in wearing a gray tailored suit, a small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carrying a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. Norton goes to meet her and turns a little towards Keyes, arranging a chair for Phyllis, who sits and nods silently. Neff stands behind a false mantel, completely deadpan, staring straight at Phyllis, and their eyes meet for a fraction of a second. She makes as if to rise indignantly, turns, and walks out, the door closing after her. There is a pregnant pause, and Keyes stands up, grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand, and drains it in one big gulp while Norton watches him almost stupefied.",
    "514": "Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified, and is then seen leaving the hospital. He strides slowly, his shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets, and his voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side while occasional traffic goes by. Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look, but Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice. The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp. Mickey, still ruminating, stands up, fixes his pants, and walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway. He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room, and the film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera, with rows of periodicals lining the wall behind him. The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey are sitting on the opposite side of the desk, looking stunned. The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr. Smith with their eyes as he walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face. Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians, with Hannah crying and blowing her nose. Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face as they walk offscreen, and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room, which is brightly lit and cluttered with pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee. Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate while the sun pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen. Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins. Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch, rubbing his forehead. Norman chuckles, and Mickey starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol and sighs. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts, then stops his pacing and looks at the group before starting to pace behind the couch anew. Norman and Carol remain silent as Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman, rubbing his hands on his knees, then leans back against the wall. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting, and Carol glances at Norman and chuckles nervously while he takes a sip of coffee. Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting.",
    "349": "They cartwheel into the air and land in a heap. The horse is dead. Theoden lies dying beneath it. The Witch-King swoops down on his Fell-Beast, and the Fell-Beast lands on Theoden's dead horse. The Fell-Beast opens its wicked jaws, and a Rohan soldier stands before the beast. The Witch-King laughs. The Fell-Beast lifts Eowyn from her feet. Suddenly, with a mighty sword blow, the Fell-Beast's head is severed, crumpling the creature to the ground with its vast wings outstretched, sending the Witch-King sprawling. The Witch-King rises from the wreckage. Eowyn stands before him, the Fell-Beast's blood dripping from her sword. With a shrill shriek of hatred, he knocks Eowyn backward with his mace. Stunned, Eowyn tries to stand and is hit once again with a crippling blow. Eowyn tries to block the blow, but her shield shatters into many pieces as the Witch-King towers over her. Meanwhile, an Orc commander hurries to the Anduin River docks, close to the city. Large black shadows slide across the docks as sailing ships approach. A sinister black sailed ship glides into the docks, followed by nine other Corsair ships. Aragorn leaps from the leading ship and charges across the docks, roaring at the top of his lungs, followed by Legolas and Gimli. The Orcs are surprised by the three charging towards thousands of them. Suddenly, the Army of the Dead leaps straight out of the sides of the ships. They charge across the surface of the water with frightening speed, overtaking Aragorn. The Orcs scream at the sight of 5000 spectral warriors. The spectral warriors swarm into the flank of the Orc army, creating a rolling mountain of ghouls that sweep all before them away. The Orcs have no defense as their weapons cannot make contact with the ghosts. Meanwhile, Merry is on the ground and sees the Witch-King standing over Eowyn, pulling her to her feet. Merry drives his sword into the back of the Witch-King's knee, causing his sword to burst into flame and his arm to be shot with pain. Eowyn struggles to her feet, pulling off her helmet, and her long hair tumbles onto her shoulders. With her last strength, Eowyn thrusts her sword into the Witch-King's face. Eowyn's sword shatters into many shards, and the Witch-King topples back dead, with black ooze leaking from his robes and armor. A shuddering cry, fading into a shrill wail, passes with the wind. Meanwhile, Aragorn and Legolas battle the Orcs, and Legolas jumps onto the back of a giant Mumakil, bringing it down. He lands on his feet in front of Gimli.",
    "556": "The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe pulls a knife. Finally, he raises his head and thrusts his horn through the roof. As the horn smashes through the wood only inches from Indy's head, Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. Smash! The horn comes up again -- right. Indy kicks Roscoe away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach. The wooden trap door explodes as a bullet is fired from within. The door is pushed open and Halfbreed and Rough Rider hurry out of the car. Indy gets to his feet -- looks ahead -- sees a water tank alongside the track directly up ahead. In an instant, he calculates his approach -- times the distance -- and leaps for the tank's water spout. He catches it perfectly, but his velocity causes the water spout to rotate a full 360 degrees. With Indy hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the roof of a stockcar, where he looks up to see Fedora walking toward him. As Indy edges away from Fedora, a portion of the stockcar's roof collapses and Indy falls through into the car below. Indy crashes down from above. Dust rises. The men, including Roscoe, pull Indy through the hole in the roof. He stands to face them as Rough Rider points a gun in his direction. Roscoe makes a grab for the Cross -- but Indy doesn't let go. A tug-of-war ensues until a snake wiggles out from Indy's shirtsleeve and wraps around Roscoe's hand. Roscoe screams bloody murder -- releases his grip on the Cross and tries to shake off the snake. He leaps onto the next car. Indy swings down to the caboose. He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside, which contains the circus magic equipment. Indy rushes to the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears Fedora coming and dives into a magic box. Fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away. Fedora is mystified, frustrated, and angered. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees Indy running along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses. Indy bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A husky barks as Indy runs past in search of his father. Indy charges in.",
    "364": "GANDALF spurs SHADOWFAX forward with PIPPIN clinging tightly to the horse's mane, while FARAMIR remains at the rear, sword in hand, trying to fend off a deadly assault as the fell-beasts dive low again. GANDALF thunders into view, raising his staff, and a shaft of white light suddenly stabs upward, causing the Nazgul to swerve away as sunlight streams through a hole onto Pelennor Fields. The Nazgul circle away from the sun rays, spiraling higher and higher, and with the Nazgul defeated, GANDALF and the Rangers ride toward the safety of Minas Tirith. IORLAS runs toward the gates, yelling, and the great gates open, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR, and the Osgiliath survivors to ride in, despite nearly 100 wounded. As GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up, FARAMIR steers his horse through the crowd, suddenly staring at PIPPIN, with GANDALF reading surprise in his eyes. FARAMIR shakes his head, and GANDALF is deeply troubled. Elsewhere, FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM up a dizzying stairway carved into the sheer cliff, with narrow, unevenly spaced, and broken steps so steep they climb like a ladder, trying not to look at the long black fall below. FRODO's foot slips, and he hangs precariously from the rock face, with GOLLUM peering down from above. FRODO tries to clamber up onto the ledge, and as he does, the ring slips out of his shirt and dangles in full view of GOLLUM, who rears back in shock and tenses like a cat. FRODO, with his head bowed, struggles to pull himself up as GOLLUM's fingers close in on the ring. SAM teeters on the precipitous stairs, and a startled FRODO looks down at SAM, losing footing, as SAM’s horrified face observes GOLLUM suddenly grasp FRODO's arm, pulling him safely onto the ledge. GOLLUM glares down at SAM, blinks to mask the malice in his eyes, and whispers in FRODO's ear as FRODO looks at SAM, his hand straying to his neck, closing tight around the ring. High above Osgiliath, the sinister profile of the Witch King seated on a fell beast is observed as Gothmog stands awaiting orders, and Gondorian soldiers react upon Minas Tirith, anxiously crowding around GANDALF dressed in oversized armor. PIPPIN kneels before DENETHOR, kissing his proffered ring as DENETHOR gently raises PIPPIN's head, their eyes meeting. DENETHOR addresses his meal as FARAMIR finally realizes the truth, and for a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate. FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, turns to leave, stops, then turns back.",
    "901": "Purvis's beady eyes peer downward, deep in thought. Later, Purvis uses a candlestick phone. On the other end, a boyish agent, Sam Cowley, nods, hangs up, and grabs some maps. As Sam's team arms up, Purvis and his armed peers board a prop plane on an airfield. Now, under a dim table lamp, a hand turns on a boxy radio. He lies down on a modest twin bed. Dillinger picks up his pocket watch off the nightstand, opens it and admires a photo of Billie on the inside of the cover. Dillinger's profile grows blurry as the view focuses on the radio beyond. Now, on a forest road, two motorcars douse their headlights as they creep forward and park on the dirt shoulder. Purvis, Winstead, and several others in trench coats climb out of the vehicles. Purvis closes his door most of the way but leaves it cracked open. The men advance, armed with their rifles and submachine guns, as the G-men cross the shadowy woods. Purvis and Winstead stand shoulder to shoulder as they spot the lodge a few hundred yards off. Purvis looks Winstead in the eye. The partner G-men filter outwards through the trees toward the lodge. Inside a warmly lit barroom. Outside, Purvis passes in and out of light as he treads forward. Toting a rifle, Baum comes up on his left. Meanwhile, Winstead rounds past a tree. Inside, Baby Face approaches a couple eating dinner. He pats a guy on a barstool then faces the couple. Outside, Purvis spies a window framing a view of two women, a tuxedoed man and a fourth person drinking and smoking inside. As he stalks closer, three working-class men exit the lodge. Purvis watches them closely from behind a tree. Inside Dillinger's room, a framed religious icon hangs on the wall over his bed as he rests. Outside, the car backs up. Purvis aims his Tommy gun. The car starts forward. Purvis and two of his peers open fire. The shots knock out the headlights and riddle the car from top to bottom with holes. Inside, Dillinger springs awake, grabs his Tommy gun, and goes to a window. In the barroom, Baby Face returns fire through a window, as does Dillinger from the second story. As muzzle flashes light up the night, indoors and out, Winstead carefully lines up a rifle shot from the base of a tree. Now in Dillinger's room, Wedge joins the shootout. As Purvis sprints for a tree closer to the disabled car, Baby Face unleashes a barrage of fire from a barroom window. Purvis takes cover and reloads. As he makes a run for the car, shells fire from the launch, and outside, Purvis sees the car's lifeless occupants.",
    "627": "Behind him, shrubs growing outside the farmhouse are buffeted by the growing wind. Merrill eyes the crops suspiciously, then retreats. He picks up the cotton sack, jogs up the steps to the farmhouse veranda, and hits indoors. Morgan and Bo are glued to the TV screen in the closet. Graham and Merrill arrive. They stand and watch. Graham looks uneasy. Merrill is deep in thought. The presenter shifts fearfully. Unflinching, Graham stares directly at the television screen. Standing rooted to the floor, Graham continues to scrutinize the images on the TV, his features sagging mournfully as he reflects on the presenter's words. He wanders off, leaving Merrill alone with Morgan and Bo. The two children are mesmerized by the screen. Merrill kneels down on the floor beside them. Looking up at Merrill, pale with worry, Morgan turns back to the TV. Graham is now in the room. He moves to a window, which is being partially boarded up on the inside, and peers out. He then takes a plank of old wood and secures it over the window, blocking out the light completely. Outside, the silver pipes of a wind chime knock against each other. Then, more chimes are disturbed by the strengthening breeze. Graham sits indoors in dim lights, staring and failing me ahead. Merrill sauces into the room and stops next to Morgan and Bo, who are standing against a wall. Graham nods. Graham smiles. Graham turns to look at his brother. Graham beams. His lips spread into a smile. Later, in the dimly lit kitchen, pans and bowls, one full of empty eggshells, are stacked up into two sinks. On a worktop lies a sharp knife along with a skinned onion, some potato peel on top of a tomato. Graham, Merrill, and the two children sit silently at the dinner table in the next room. Shifting awkwardly in his chair, Graham casts a fleeting glance at the others. Graham's taken aback. Graham's lips tremble slightly. Morgan's eyes are swollen. He reaches over and stabs his fork into a piece of molten toast, then sits back down. Merrill watches in disbelief as Graham tucks into his mount of food. Bo, sitting next to him, is in tears. Upset, Graham winces as he eats. Observing him, Morgan gets up from his chair and goes to his dad who is now throwing down his fork and sobbing uncontrollably. Morgan leans into his father who hugs him tightly, then pulls Bo to his other side. Merrill is staring self-consciously at his plate when Graham's hand reaches out and tucks him in the family embrace. Graham's body rocks as he cries. At the other end of the table, the red lines on the baby monitor begin to flash.",
    "1032": "Natalie's taken aback as Ryan grins when they arrive at the hotel. Natalie's face crumples, and she starts to sob. Ryan frowns awkwardly and holds out his hands as she falls into his arms. Ryan then sees Alex and gives her a little embarrassed wave. She comes over, and Natalie shoots Ryan a look before frowning. Natalie raises a drink to her lips as Alex smiles broadly. Natalie looks down thoughtfully, and Ryan gives an I-told-you-so look as Natalie appears uncertain. They walk through the lobby and go to the registration desk for the Alpha-tech party. Ryan and Alex casually pick up name badges and neck bands, and, looking a bit shifty, Natalie does the same and follows them around a corner. The threesome clip their name badges to their neck bands and hang them around their necks. Alex reads Natalie's name badge. At the party in the hotel ballroom, Natalie, Alex, and Ryan are at the bar getting drinks. They turn around and survey the scene where people stand at small white tables with shiny balloons floating on ribbons above them. Ryan, Natalie, and Alex go stand around a table, and Natalie has a gulp from her drink. She nods and smiles, looks at Alex, and then walks onto the dance floor. Alex grabs Ryan, and they dance together while Natalie wanders about on her own, moving to the music. A young guy with a stubbly chin bops about and notices Natalie. He leans to her, and she smiles, then looks at her name badge. A DJ on the stage is a big black guy, and Ryan and Alex have their picture taken in front of a backdrop of a giant wave. They squat, hold out their arms, and pretend they're surfing. Natalie and Dave pose for pictures, and a bit drunk, she drapes herself all over him. Dave holds Natalie up as they leave the photo area. On the dance floor, Alex and Ryan face each other and shout while everyone points in the air and jumps around. Later, Ryan and Alex are at the table where he hands her a key card, and they both smile. Natalie sings karaoke on a yacht in the harbor as a few drunken party guests, including Dave, are there. Alex and Ryan sit on a platform at the back of the yacht, and he dangles his feet in the clear, blue water. They gaze at each other, then share a lingering kiss. The power fails, and all the lights in the yacht go out. Ryan and Alex look back toward the city lights, some distance away. Everyone gets a ride back to land in a small pontoon boat. They jog up onto the sandy beach, and a courtesy bus delivers the group to the hotel. They run into the entrance barefoot, and Ryan wakes up in bed.",
    "717": "The steward removes Jack's coat, while the master-at-arms frisks him, and the steward pulls the necklace from the pocket. Cal takes the necklace and walks past Rose. The master-at-arms handcuffs Jack as Lovejoy passes the coat to him, and the master-at-arms carts Jack away. In the chartroom, Andrews unrolls the ship's blueprint, and Andrews, Smith, and others study it. Andrews stares at the blueprint and turns to Smith, who glances away with his brow furrowed while Murdoch swallows hard. A ship officer enters and stands in a doorway as Smith turns toward Ismay. Alone in the sitting room, Cal walks toward Rose, who blinks and gazes at him. Cal stares at her, opens his mouth as if to speak, then slaps her face and grabs her. The steward enters, and Cal releases Rose. The steward fetches two life belts and stewards open the cabin doors in third class. Smith writes coordinates and hands the message to dark-haired Jack Phillips. Smith takes off his hat, glances at the door, puts his hat back on, and walks out. Phillips stares at Smith slack-jawed, exchanges glances with Bride, a young brown-haired man, then puts on a headset and sends a telegraph. On the boat deck, officers supervise and swing them out over the water as Chief Officer Wilde stands at lifeboat four and yells to a man on an upper deck. Andrews enters the A deck foyer where dozens of passengers chat and drink as musicians play, a waiter approaches Andrews with drinks on a tray, and nearby, Molly Brown stops a brown-haired steward. Molly passes Cal, Rose, and Ruth, who turns to her two maids, and the maids leave. Rose stops Andrews as he wanders past, and Andrews pulls Rose aside, with Cal standing nearby who leans forward. Andrews nods and walks off. Meanwhile, in his office, the master-at-arms handcuffs Jack to a vertical water pipe as Lovejoy stands nearby. A dark-haired crewman rushes in, and Lovejoy pulls out a handgun. As he leaves with the crewman, the master-at-arms hands Lovejoy the handcuff key. Jack and Lovejoy stare at each other as Lovejoy sits in a desk chair. On the bridge, Bride runs up to Smith while Lightoller, a man with short, light brown hair, and Murdoch hurry over to Smith. Lightoller glances at Murdoch and rushes to passengers as band-leader Wallace Hartley leads the band onto the boat deck and the band plays. In steerage, a steward hands out life belts to third-class passengers, and Fabrizio follows Tommy, who grabs a life belt and puts it on. They stand behind a crowd of passengers on the stairs leading to the main deck, where at the top of the stairs, a steward stands behind a locked gate as a young brown-haired boy turns to his auburn-haired mother.",
    "381": "Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward, but it's hard to hear over the music. Edward stops dancing, and after a brief moment, he heads for the edge of the crowd, walking down Main Street. The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving and some shaking their heads, saying poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy. Jenny runs to him and would tackle him if she could, but Edward keeps walking. In various shots, Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet, which is horrible and almost unendurable, and then it gets worse. The trees ahead are moving, and at first it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as the wood cracks and groans, it's unmistakable: they're trying to block him. Snake-like white roots shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches and swings off, lands, and rolls. Now all the trees are moving to block him, towering over him in the flashes of lightning. As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught, and he's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks, and the silver key disappears into the mud. Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out, but the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. He screams up at the night until his breath is gone. With a sudden calm, another lightning flash occurs, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain and laughing. His bare foot steps onto asphalt, and Edward turns to see to his right, a larger, paved road. Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet, and with that, the men start walking down the larger road. Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's exhausted from the trip downstairs but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual. The other three eat awkwardly, each clink and scrape of a knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence, and as Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks, and all three stop to listen. She smiles. He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine motions, asking if it’s okay for her to sit on the bed, and he nods. She shakes her head, and a long beat passes. Then, deadpan, Edward rolls his eyes, why not. Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. We stay with Edward in bed as he grimaces, a flash of pain showing that around others he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone it's clear how bad it is.",
    "1187": "Pettigrew grabs Lupin's wand, turns back into a rat, and runs off, leaving only a pile of clothes. Hermione grabs Harry's arm to stop him from following. Lupin's fingers turn to claws, he bursts out of his clothes, his limbs grow thin and twisted, his face becomes a long snout with sharp teeth, and he flings Sirius aside and stands whimpering. Hermione slowly approaches, and the creature looks at her pathetically before howling to the moon. Snape appears, and the werewolf lashes out at him. The black dog leaps out of the shadows and knocks the werewolf to the ground. The animals face each other growling, then both leap to the attack, colliding in mid-air, then falling, snarling and biting. The dog runs off, chased by the werewolf. Harry follows and sees the werewolf hurling the dog against a rock. Harry throws a stone and hits the werewolf on the back of the head, causing it to turn slowly and lope menacingly toward him. It stops, lifts its head, and runs toward the sound of howling. From where the dog fell, a figure gets up and limps away through the bushes. Harry follows the figure, hurrying through the trees toward the moonlit lake, running down the bank and across the stony shore to the edge of the water. Sirius is lying on his back, his eyes closed, with a bloody claw mark on his shoulder. The water lapping the shore stops moving as a sheet of crackling ice spreads over the surface of the lake. Sirius opens his eyes and shudders with horror. Harry looks up to see a swarm of hooded Dementors circling above their heads, their black cloaks fluttering behind them. One swoops down and attacks Sirius. Harry pulls out his wand and points it at the Dementors, forming a silver mist as a protective shield that holds the Dementors back. But the power of Harry's wand fades, and the Dementors return to the attack. He cries out in horror as he falls back onto the stony beach beside Sirius. The Dementors circle overhead again, then swoop lower and lower, hovering over the two figures lying helpless below as life is gradually sucked out of them. A faint, silvery breath floats from Sirius' half-open mouth, illuminating his face. Exhausted, Harry lifts his head and, to his surprise, sees the Dementors floating harmlessly. He sees something shining on the far side of the frozen lake: a magnificent silver stag with huge antlers stands facing him, glowing amongst the trees. Harry gazes at the beautiful animal as the dazzling light surrounding the stag grows even brighter. As the Dementors start to move again, they are turned back by a powerful invisible shield and swoop away over Harry's head.",
    "843": "He casually pours out the Barbicide disinfectant and drops the glass container on the floor, then flips open a Zippo lighter and strikes it on his leg. Her mouth hangs open, and she points to the desk. At night, in Sandy's car, Diana smiles as she applies makeup. He faces forward with a stern gaze and shakes his head. As they enter a restaurant, a young red-haired waitress greets them, then walks away smiling. He signals the waitress, and she turns, shocked to see Sandy. She glares at Sandy and leaves as he looks upward. The waitress returns with a mound of food, and she pulls her thumb from Sandy's soup. As the waitress leaves, Diana takes a large bite of ribs. In a motel, they approach the front desk, and she leaves. Diana enters The Foxhole, where a husky bearded man in a cowboy hat notices her and nods to himself as Diana sips her green beverage. He turns away, and she notices his Mercedes car key and thick gold ring on his pinky. The man smiles, sits beside her, removes his hat, and extends a hand, wearing a turquoise bolo. They toast and down their shots. They sit at a table with several empty shot glasses, and as they drink another shot, Diana slaps the table. Sandy enters and scans the room, smiling as he approaches their table. She points at Chuck and places a hand on his shoulder. Big Chuck nods, and she leads him to the dance floor. Diana and Big Chuck shimmy, and with her eyes on Sandy, Diana pinches Chuck's nipples through his shirt. Spinning around, Diana bends over, and Big Chuck twirls his cowboy hat behind her like riding a bronco. She stands and they continue dancing with her eyes on Sandy, who motions toward the door. Facing Chuck, Diana shimmies in place and suddenly drops into a split with her face by his crotch. Big Chuck points finger guns at Sandy as Diana dances on the floor. They enter a motel room where Sandy sets down his wallet. Chuck walks into Diana's arms, and Big Chuck whips off his belt, swinging it up from his crotch like an elephant's trunk and hitting Sandy in the face. Chuck gives him a final belt slap, then drops it. He aims a finger gun at his crotch and unbuttons his pants, dropping them. She spanks Big Chuck as he rapidly knocks his knees. Diana swipes the anxiety pills, and stumbling back, Chuck pulls up his pants. Big Chuck grabs her hips from behind, and they fall backwards onto the bed. Big Chuck spreads his legs in the air and sits up as Diana drops a pill into his cup, then pours two drinks as he twitches drunkenly.",
    "333": "A long drawn wail comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. The sound of hooves is close. A sinister mounted Ringwraith steps into view, hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes. Frodo freezes in terror. The Ringwraith pauses right beside their hiding place, sitting very still with his head bowed, listening. Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The Ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log and peering suspiciously into the woods. From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent, his head turning from side to side. He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands, his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible internal struggle. Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road. The Ringwraith spins around at the sound and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly slumps as if a psychic link had been broken. Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. The Black Rider turns and departs. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees, slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. Merry moves past Pippin toward Frodo, watching intently, while Sam keeps looking around nervously. The four Hobbits sprawl on the ground, holding their breath. The silhouette of a Black Rider looms against the skyline. Merry looks at his friend, realizing Frodo is in deep trouble. The Hobbits break cover. Suddenly, a Ringwraith bursts out of the forest toward them. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin are running toward the wide, placid Brandywine River and the ferry. The Hobbits stampede across the wharf and tumble onto the ferry. Frodo races across the wooden wharf, followed by the Ringwraiths. He leaps into the ferry, shrieking with rage. The Hobbits cover their ears. Sam and Merry shove off with the poles. The ferry slides out into the river, just as the Ringwraiths arrive. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses toward the north and gallop away along the riverbank, quickly disappearing into the fog. Lights of Bree, a small village of stone and half-timbered houses, are nestled against a low wooded hill. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin approach the gatehouse, wild-eyed, ragged, and out of breath. A thick hedge surrounds the village, and a great gate bars the western entrance. A surly gatekeeper glances down at them. The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the Hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree, the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light.",
    "872": "He pretends to spoon more of the sauce, and Kate opens her mouth, ready to taste it. Nick draws the spoon away a couple of times and watches her full lips open and close. Then, he leans over and plants a kiss to one side of her mouth. The couple move apart slightly, and Kate pulls off her blindfold. She moves back in towards Nick. Nick's face edges towards Kate's, and this time he kisses her fully on the lips. The couple begin to kiss more urgently. Kate brings her hands up to cup Nick's face, and she stands. Her eyes are closed, and her face is relaxed into a serene ecstasy, as Nick kisses her neck then returns to her lips. Finally, Kate falls into Nick's embrace. Next morning, Nick strides down the hallway rattling a spoon in a saucepan. In Zoe's room, Zoe, Kate, and Nick are piled into a photo booth. Outside, Kate screams with glee at the pictures. The trio walk down a cold, sunny New York street. Nick has Zoe on his shoulders. All three wear coats, scarves, and woolly hats. They dart across a busy street to a Chinese vegetable shop. They leave the shop. All three wear cycling helmets as they pedal a bicycle made for three. The sun sets against the Manhattan skyline as they pedal alongside the river. Nick sits up front. Later in the evening, they come across a street artist copying a fantastical picture of a ballerina onto the pavement in colored chalk. Nick and Kate hold hands. Zoe beams up at them as she admires the drawing. The staff are gathered at the restaurant to review the menu. In the kitchen, Nick completes a vegetable garnish on a dish and lays it out for a waiter. Kate eyes him with suspicion. Paula strolls in from the dining room. Nick is wide-eyed with surprise as he watches Kate stride off to the walk-in fridge. He joins her. The couple stare at each other. From the kitchen, they're framed in the window of the fridge door. Kate is left thoughtful. She returns to her apartment, where a woman in her 60s waits on the sofa. Kate locks the apartment door, turns out the hall lights, and saunters back into the room. Passing a side table, she presses a button on the answer phone then lifts a remote and turns off the music. Kate stares thoughtfully. She heads towards her bedroom. Zoe cuddles up to her furry kangaroo. Kate goes into her room. Zoe rolls onto her side. At the restaurant, Paula tackles Kate as she prepares dishes. Kate interviews a series of applicants. At the apartment, Zoe watches TV as Kate works at her desk.",
    "191": "The camera pulls up from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops, heavenly voices are heard, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly. A small star flies in from the left of the screen, stops, and twinkles as Clarence speaks. The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen, which slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill preparing to slide down on large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill, where George Bailey is at the bottom of the slide. As each boy comes down, the others applaud, and there is a series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice. On top of the hill, Harry makes his slide very fast, passing the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water. George jumps into the water and grabs Harry, and as he starts to pull him out, he yells. The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain, and when George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety. Five or six boys are coming toward the camera, arm in arm, whistling, and their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street, in which we catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding. The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore, which is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop, George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter, shuts his eyes and makes a wish, clicks the lighter, and the flame springs up. George crosses over to the soda fountain, where Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him, and goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain. Mr. Gower, the druggist, peers from a window in the back room and is seen taking a drink from a bottle. Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. George is behind the soda fountain putting on his apron, and Violet, who is the same height and age as Mary but infinitely older in her approach to people, observes him.",
    "636": "Graham's silver station wagon drives along the freeway and passes a large modern church. The station wagon parks beside other vehicles outside a parade of shops, and the family gets out. Merrill feeds the parking meter, and Morgan holds his hand out to Graham. Graham hands Morgan some cash, and Morgan and Bo head off down the sidewalk together. Graham watches them as Morgan holds out his hand and Bo takes it. Graham turns and calls to Merrill, who strolls off in the other direction. Morgan is in a bookshop watching the news coverage with the middle-aged proprietors, while Graham waits at the counter in a pharmacy listening to a radio. The young shop assistant comes to the counter with a paper prescription bag and leans pensively on the counter. Tracy's face crumples, and Graham looks awkward. Meanwhile, Merrill is in an army recruitment center looking at posters where a gray-haired man in a sergeant's uniform sits at a desk with a poster of Uncle Sam behind him. Merrill turns to the sergeant, and Cunningham stares up at Merrill. Merrill gazes apprehensively down at Cunningham, then laughs. Cunningham gives Merrill a pamphlet, and Merrill stares at Cunningham, then nods. A scruffy young man is filling out a form. Lionel smirks, with stubble on his chin and wearing a t-shirt and sleeveless biker jacket. Merrill folds up the pamphlet and puts it in his pocket, then walks solemnly towards the door. He stops just behind Lionel and jerks as though about to hit him, causing Lionel to flinch, and then Merrill leaves. In the bookshop, Bo sits at a table and sips a glass of water as a cola commercial comes on TV. Morgan holds the book out to the lady. Meanwhile, in the pharmacy, Tracy thinks. Merrill, Morgan, and Bo are already eating in a pizza restaurant when Graham comes in and sits at their table. The other three nod, and Graham sighs and nods back, then glances out of the restaurant doorway. His expression hardens when he sees a young dark-haired man of Asian descent strolling down the sidewalk and opening the back door of a brown Chevrolet four by four. Morgan follows his father's gaze and looks out of the doorway at the man, and Merrill also gazes out at the young man. Graham and his family stare fixedly out at the young man, who shuts his car door and glances over at the restaurant, seeing the family gazing back at him. His mouth opens in surprise as Graham takes a deep breath. The young man looks unsettled as he gets into his driver's seat, fires up the engine, and the four by four swings out of its parking bay and accelerates off down the road. Graham turns back to the table and takes a bite of pizza, while Merrill, Morgan, and Bo continue looking out at the street.",
    "480": "They pause and Norman pauses. Norman walks past Sam, giving him a quick, disapproving glance, goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow Norman. Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, and takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. By this time, Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter. Sam scans the counter, looking for a registration book. Lila moves closer and studies the book as Sam signs in. When Sam has finished, he closes the book and hands it back to Norman. As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, and looks at him. Sam smiles, takes a bill out of his pocket. Norman reluctantly goes behind the counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under the counter, and starts to write. Lila steps to the desk, picks up the key quickly, and starts out. Norman looks up and gazes at her as she goes out the door. Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, and tries the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam and Norman coming out of the motel office and continues down the porch. Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, and rises. He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then back to Lila. Lila goes to the door. He holds it open, and she goes out. Sam closes the door, joins Lila, and takes her hand. Together, they walk along the porch toward Cabin One. They pause before the door of Cabin One. Sam motions Lila to wait and hold still, then goes on to the office, opens the door, and calls in. Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet, and puts the wallet away. She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm and stops her. Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and himself to pass through. Lila comes out, turns to her left, and goes along the porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside the open door. Sam starts into the office. She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house.",
    "671": "He raises it to his lips to find that it's already been drunk. He tips it upside down, and its little umbrella falls to the floor. Back inside, Harry staggers up to him. He slaps Peter's face a second time. Peter's head swings to one side, then he turns to face Harry. The two eyeball each other before Harry, tight-lipped, turns and walks away. Peter lowers his head. Her arms folded, MJ looks slightly flustered as the guests applaud. She opens the palm of her hand towards John and moves up to the podium to join him, watched by a stunned Peter. Peter raises the camera to his eye. The lights of the Empire State Building form the backdrop for Spider-Man to swing slowly and gently through the city. He stretches out his right hand and flexes his wrist. He tries again and again, then falls. He lands face down in a puddle. Rises, pulls off the mask then flexes his wrists. Still nothing happens. He studies his fingertips, then looks up at the building to his right. Standing alone in an alley, he moves to the building. Places his hands on its surface and starts to climb. He moves rapidly up the outside of the building, climbing with ease. He starts to slip down, then comes to a halt. Grasping for a handle, he slips back into the puddle. He shakes his wet hands and leans back against a rubbish skip. He notices a newspaper hanging over the side. He grabs it and screws up his eyes to try to read the headline and focus on the picture. In his room, he tosses it away. Looking dejected, Peter sits on his bed. He takes the back of his left hand up to his forehead and wipes his brow. Octavius is at the desk in his lab, the four mechanical limbs busying themselves around him. One holds a cigar to his mouth. Another lights it for him. Octavius raises the dark glasses he's wearing from his eyes. Puffs on the cigar, then blows the match. Louise and MJ in a shoe store. Peter's at his doctor being examined. He points to his head. The doctor nods, then heaves himself up onto the examination couch to sit beside Peter. He nods again, and Peter reflects. Peter sits in his room, his head against the wall. Big flashes illuminate the darkness. Peter's eyes are bright. Sitting in the front seat of a car, the old man holds out his hand. Peter looks at the hand, only inches from him. He purses his lips. His face screws up and his eyes flicker. He turns his gaze on Uncle Ben who stares right back at him, a sad expression on his face.",
    "1151": "Dumbledore reads the name written on the parchment, and Viktor punches the air. His friends congratulate him as he rises from his seat and shakes Dumbledore's hand before leaving the hall. The flame flares again, and Dumbledore reads a second piece of smoldering parchment. Beaming with pleasure, Fleur shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor. Smiling broadly, he shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Viktor and Fleur out of the hall. Crouch uncovers a magnificent crystal and silver trophy. Snape steps forward alarmed as the goblet of fire flares once more, and Dumbledore turns in surprise as the blue flame leaps high into the air. The flame turns red, and Karkaroff glares as sparks fly from a piece of scorched parchment, which flutters down into Dumbledore's hand. He reads it, and all eyes turn to Harry, who sits down nervously. Hagrid shakes his head while Hermione forces Harry to his feet. Ron glowers as Harry walks hesitantly towards Professor Dumbledore. The piece of parchment is still smoking at the edges when Dumbledore thrusts it into Harry's hand. Looking stunned, Harry walks the length of the hall, uncomfortably aware of unfriendly looks from his fellow students. Snape narrows his eyes as Harry passes him, and Professor McGonagall pats his shoulder reassuringly. Mad-Eye Moody gives him a hard stare, and a pair of iron gates opens in front of Harry. The other three competitors look surprised to see him as Dumbledore bursts into the room, followed by Karkaroff, Snape, Crouch, Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Madame Maxime. Dumbledore grabs Harry, and every eye in the room is focused on him. He swallows nervously as rain pours from the mouth of a gargoyle outside. In a high tower, the Hogwarts professors meet and consult together, and Professor McGonagall looks anxiously at Dumbledore, who puts his wand to his temple. A thread of memory drifts into a bowl, and a parchment with Harry's name surfaces. Later, Harry sits on his bed while Ron hangs a wet towel beside the stove, climbs into his four-poster bed, and turns his back. Harry scrambles into bed, takes off his glasses, and pulls up the covers as Ron looks across at him. Ron lies awake, his face buried in his pillow. The competitors pose for a photo, and she looks at Harry. In a tiny room, a green quill hovers over a notebook as Rita pushes Harry inside. The quill writes while she winks at him, and Harry gestures to the quill. A small black owl swoops over Hogwarts School, heading towards a tall, isolated tower. Harry is waiting in the owlery as the black owl flies in through the window. He takes the note from its beak, unfolds it eagerly, and reads, then sucks his pecked finger. On Saturday night, he hurries down into the Gryffindor common room.",
    "993": "At night, a green light pulses through a mist at the edge of a body of water as snowflakes drift through the dark sky, beyond which stands a stately Victorian building. Inside, the narrator, Nick Carraway, is with a doctor who sits, listening, while Nick sits with his head resting on his hands. Nick goes to a window, paces around the room, and his handsome face is set in a haggard, weary frown. The streets of New York are crowded with people, with frantic traders on Wall Street, money piling up, dancing girls, and illicit booze being bottled, as a red biplane does a corkscrew dive above a skyscraper. A younger, fresh-faced Nick looks up from the busy street, smiling. At work, Nick is on the phone, and a girl beckons from the beach towards a spectacular mansion with an ornate garden where men play polo on the lawn. In his trophy room, Tom hurls a football at Nick and charges at him, barging him through double doors. Nick looks around and finds himself in a large salon with several pairs of doors open as long white drapes billow across the room in the breeze, beneath an ornate crystal chandelier. A young woman cavorts on a couch, and as the servants close the doors, the beautiful blonde-haired young woman rises on the couch and pulls him over it. Another young woman, a brunette, sits with her, and Nick turns to Daisy as Tom glowers at her. The butler, Henri, gestures towards the doors, which are all opened by servants, as the drapes billow into the room. Later, dinner is served at a long table on the terrace, and at the sound of a telephone, Daisy's smile fades as her eyes dart nervously. Handsome, debonair Tom goes into the salon with Daisy going after him. Nick smiles at Jordan as Henri opens the doors, and Daisy and Tom return, with Daisy closing her eyes despairingly as they stop by rose bushes. She glances round at Tom, watching from the open doors of the salon, looking tearful, and then gazes wistfully into the distance, beyond the lavish gardens, past the green beacon and across the Bay of Consequence, towards West Egg and Gatsby's mansion. In the dark, a man walks towards the end of a long, narrow, raised dock which juts out into the bay. Nick drives along a tree-lined lane, parks his car in front of his cottage, and gets out, looking over at the dock. Nick walks closer and sees the suited man standing at the end of the dock by railings, watching as the man slowly raises his right hand. Way off in the distance, across the water, the bright green beacon pulses. In the sanitarium, Nick stands at the window, tapping the frosted glass, as outside, snow continues to fall.",
    "347": "Reluctantly, Pippin hands the palantir to Gandalf, who immediately smothers it in his cloak, and looks back at Pippin troubled. A group of riders gallop towards the Rohan city of Edoras. Eowyn stands alone outside the Golden Hall, waiting. Inside, a roaring fire, a lamb roasting on a spit, long tables laden with food, and barrels of wine make a banquet ready for the returning soldiers. Amidst the cheering crowd, Eowyn moves towards Aragorn with a chalice, and their eyes meet. Eowyn looks at her uncle as Theoden follows her gaze and watches concerned as her uncle moves away, disturbed by his tone. Merry and Pippin are in full voice, on top of one of the tables, holding very large mugs of ale in their hands, while Gandalf laughs and claps at the hobbits. Aragorn steps up beside Gandalf, smiling at the floorshow, and Gandalf turns quickly to Aragorn, watching his friend's face, seeking reassurance. Frodo and Sam lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool, with Smeagol nearby, muttering in his sleep. Smeagol wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in sweat, eyes wide in horror, as his features transform into the malevolent face of Gollum. Smeagol glances over his shoulder at the sleeping Frodo and Sam as he clambers off his rock, silently sidling towards the edge of a stagnant pool. He stares into the murky depths of the water, where the surface ripples as the face of Gollum appears as Smeagol's. Smeagol is seen choking Deagol, with fingers locked tight around his throat as his eyes flicker open. Sam's image is mirrored in the water as he smacks Gollum on the head with his pot, drops the pot, and flings himself on top of Gollum, who screams and flails wildly. Frodo staggers over to Sam and pulls him off Gollum, who is huddled on the ground sobbing, as Sam makes for Smeagol again with a look of murderous rage. Frodo grabs Sam's arm, but Sam pulls away and stares at Frodo at a loss, his face softening. Frodo beckons to Gollum, who turns slowly, staring at Sam through hooded, hate-filled eyes, and smiles. Aragorn joins Legolas on the steps to the Golden Hall, oblivious to the chill wind as they look out across the sleeping city to the looming mountain range beyond, with dark clouds marking the sky. Legolas looks at Aragorn with realization on his face. He is awake, sits up anxious, hops out of bed, and creeps towards the sleeping form of Gandalf. Pippin gasps with fright as Merry sits up, wiping sleep from his eyes, and moves on. A sleeping Gandalf lies with eyes wide open, but Pippin is undeterred.",
    "1191": "Harry jumps up onto the bed, and the book scurries underneath in a flurry of torn paper. Harry lies down and peers under the bed, watching the book, which lies still, then snaps once more and slithers out, turning this way and that before it slides back under the bed. Harry quickly unties his shoelace and dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed, dropping his shoe onto the floor, prompting the book to hurtle out, snapping its covers, as Harry jumps onto the book with both feet. In the corridor, a maid knocks at the room next door, and Harry goes downstairs. A ginger cat chases a rat down the corridor, passing a wanted poster for Sirius Black. On the Hogwarts Express, Mrs. Weasley passes Ron his rat, and a man is asleep in a compartment. Harry slides the door closed as steam billows from the funnel while the Hogwarts Express travels through the rain beside the edge of a vast lake. Harry peers along the corridor, and the door slides shut as the lights go out. Ron stares out the window into the rain as the Express stops on a viaduct, and one by one, the carriages go dark. The train lurches again, and the air turns so cold that they can see their breath. Ron pulls his hand away from the window as frost spreads across the glass, and ice forms in Professor Lupin's bottle of water while he remains asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak. The train lurches again, and Hermione shivers. Something appears out in the corridor, floating towards the door, something black, shapeless, and mysterious. It reaches out as the door slides open, revealing a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaching into the compartment. A hooded black shape looms in the doorway, as Hermione's cat spits and Ron's rat, Scabbers, hides under his coat. The hideous cloaked figure floats into the compartment and faces Harry, who stares helplessly at the terrifying creature that seems to draw the energy out of him, making his body go stiff. Professor Lupin throws off his cloak and points his wand at the threatening figure, which, in a flash of light, hurtles backwards and disappears. Harry loses consciousness and then opens his eyes, finding himself lying on the seat. Hermione hands him his glasses, which he puts on, and looking confused, he takes a piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. He gets up, turns, and smiles as Ron and Hermione stare at him. Harry looks at the rain teeming down outside the window and stares at his own worried face reflected in the glass. Horseless carriages take the students up to Hogwarts Castle, where they assemble in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast, sitting at long tables with lighted candles hanging above their heads as they listen to the choir.",
    "886": "His eyes linger on her for a long moment as she talks to Charlotte, but when he realizes they're discussing him, he turns away. Resplendent in her green silk gown and fashionable feather hat, Miss Bingley tolerates the dancing, wheeling in and out with a haughty air, while Lizzie is up with Bingley, having a much better time. Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst watch the moment with disgust, slumped in a chair, as a sozzled Mr. Hurst taps his glass, demanding a refill. Mrs. Bennet gleefully watches Jane and Bingley dance together, but Darcy is not so pleased. They hurry to greet her at the party where Mary plays the piano, and several men in red and gold brocade uniforms of their regiment mill amongst the party-goers, while Lydia and Kitty are surrounded by officers. Darcy watches proceedings with his customary aloof air as Lizzie, on the opposite side of the room, catches his brooding stare and is momentarily affected before composing herself and turning to Colonel Forster. The Bingley sisters share a look. Lydia grabs a young boy and girl by the hand and leads them onto the floor, joined by several officers. Lizzie turns and looks at the intimate pair, and Mr. Darcy, aware of them looking at him, glowers. Lydia dances playfully as Lizzie makes her way across the room, under Darcy’s watchful gaze, until Miss Bingley sidles up to him, looking decidedly put out. As she backs away, his gaze remains on Lizzie. Now in the Bennets' dining room, Mr. Bennet raises his eyebrows before the scene shifts to Jane riding Nellie through a rainstorm, soaked through, while at home, Lizzie looks with concern at the storm outside and gives her mother a reproachful look. Jane makes slow progress before sitting in an ornate dining room, eating dinner with Bingley's sisters, where Miss Bingley gives her a patronizing smile as Jane closes her eyes, looking faint. Now, the Bennets eat breakfast, and Lizzie, Lydia, and Kitty walk arm-in-arm through Meryton, as Lydia looks around distractedly and they scurry away together. Lizzie, walking through a field holding her bonnet, climbs over a stile, the hem of her pale dress caked in mud, and lands in a quagmire, with her boots filthy. She gives a good-natured shrug and carries on towards Netherfield Hall, standing proudly in the distance, then walks under the shadow of a tree, startled when Darcy emerges around a corner, equally startled. She curtsies, becomes a little embarrassed, while he disguises a look of amusement, stepping aside for her to pass and following her as she strides towards the Hall.",
    "4": "He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. They laugh. She lays back on the bed. Her mind wanders for a beat. Jane looks at him and sits up. She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off, and the TV screen goes blue. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes. We're flying above Robin Hood Trail. We see the Burnham's house below us as we approach it steadily. We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway. We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body. The blender grinds as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table. Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out. Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, he glances over at her. Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying. Angle on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes. We're outside Ricky's room, moving slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost gone now. A reverse angle reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious. Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house. Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants. The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. Close on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.",
    "166": "The magazine Indian Opinion is printed, and stacks of it are lying around, while Albert West, a short Westerner, runs the simple printing press powered by a crude generator with the help of a small staff consisting of a Sikh, a Muslim, a couple of Hindus, and two young boys. Gandhi and Walker approach the tent from the river, with Gandhi discoursing earnestly, and upon reaching the entrance, he gestures in. Gandhi directs his remarks toward Charlie Andrews, who is sitting near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter. Charlie waves, and Gandhi shouts out to everyone over the noise of the generator, and they nod, with one of the Hindus bowing with hands clasped together. Gandhi hands Walker a copy of Indian Opinion, and they start across the relatively barren field toward other tents, with Walker glancing at the paper as Gandhi watches him, grinning. This interaction carries a weight and apprehension unusual for the rest of their conversation, and Walker views Gandhi with a little surprise as Gandhi seems caught by an ineluctable fact. Despite his reluctance, it conveys commitment, which Walker senses. They come to a site where a building is being erected, and a European, Kallenbach, is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, assessing its level with some Indians working below him. Gandhi turns to Kallenbach light-heartedly; Walker waves his notebook, and Kallenbach lifts his level in greeting, displaying a Star of David on his bronzed chest, while Walker looks around, grinning and shaking his head. Two women in saris are cleaning the toilet. Walker looks at him appraisingly, and after a moment of embarrassed doubt, he heads toward a half-finished building with wooden sides and a door but a canvas-covered roof, with an awning spread before it. Walker’s carriage is tethered nearby, with a Black driver standing in the sun waiting. In the background, two women are seen cleaning a latrine, and Walker glances at it as Ba looks at him coldly before turning back and walking into the building through the rear entrance. Gandhi, disconcerted by her attitude, tries to answer Walker with a forced grin. When a girl named Sora emerges from the building with another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls to the driver and enters the building, determined to find the cause of Ba's aloofness. Inside, Ba sits sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance, and Gandhi, irritated like a husband, stands in front of her. The situation is hushed, with a sense of awareness that Walker might overhear them, yet it is brimming with suppressed anger as Ba looks at Gandhi with hostility.",
    "957": "Joe and Alice are in his bedroom, and he frantically tries to tidy up, quickly hiding an essay with a C minus grade. Looking embarrassed, he picks up a model train carriage, and Alice, in her zombie makeup, suddenly looks up at Joe, who smiles. Charles comes in as Deputy Tally shows Jack a map, and Deputy Rosko pauses to tune in his radio. The Air Force is searching the house the kids are filming in front of when Jack drives up, and the kids watch uncertainly as Jack takes the camera. Jack puts Joe in the back of his patrol car and goes over to talk to Colonel Nelec, whose expression hardens. Jack steps back over to the Colonel, and sitting in the patrol car, Joe watches as the two men shake hands. Later, Joe and Jack return home, where Joe, with tears in his eyes, glares at his father, and Jack glares back, struggling to contain his emotions. Jack turns away and marches out of the house, leaving Joe looking bleak. A tear rolls down Joe's cheek, and he wipes it away with his hand. At dusk, Joe cycles up a steep hill and enters the gates of a cemetery at the top, cycling on between the headstones. Joe sits silently staring into the distance, looking down at his mother's locket, which he holds in his hand. Hearing a noise, he looks up, gets to his feet, and takes a torch from his rock sack, shining it on a building nearby. Looking through a window, he can see earth being tossed about inside the building and, spooked, he runs off. Jack drives his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field, where inside the compound, his car is immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. Nelec sits at Woodward's bedside, and with his face lacerated from the train crash, Woodward glares stonily back at the Colonel from his hospital bed. Nelec leans in closer to him, then gives him a hard stare and walks away from the bedside as his aide, Overmyer, injects toxin into Woodward's drip, and he begins to convulse. Overmyer watches this passionately as Woodward dies, while the Colonel stands with his back to the bed and waits for it to go quiet. Back at home, Joe is awakened in the middle of the night by a knocking at his window, and he gets up, opening the window to Alice, who climbs in. He takes her hand to help her down off the desk and tries the light. A Cinay projector starts up, and Alice moves forward to watch the film, which shows footage of Joe as a baby with his mother, where he sucks on her locket as she holds him.",
    "263": "The rumble builds louder and louder until it is snapped off by a click. The front door handle clicks open, and Smalls stands in the doorway of the abandoned trailer, which is perfectly quiet. The room is a complete shambles from the fight, as sunlight filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke from Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light. After a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene, Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and nudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of paper. He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes with a soft grunt of surprise as he stands up with the piece of paper. It is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank, baking in the noonday sun. Sitting in the front seat of their idling car, looking at the bank, Gale and Evelle look at each other. Gale reaches for his door, and as Gale and Evelle bang in through the door, Evelle holds a shotgun, and Gale holds a shotgun in one hand and Nathan Jr. in his car seat in the other. Everyone freezes, staring at Gale and Evelle. An old hayseed with his hands in the air speaks up, and there is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. Gale is tossing Evelle a sack and is looking in shock at the tellers' counter when a muffled voice from offscreen is heard. Evelle is momentarily abashed but then brightens as Gale registers understanding. Again, there is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. The camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs as the car approaches the townlet, its siren wailing. A teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags, and close on her hands, we see her putting in a cash packet that is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding a small plastic device. The teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking; she shoves it into the sack. He is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to Gale, who also picks up the baby as the two are backing toward the door. They bolt out the door, and the siren jumps in loud at the cut. It is the same locked-down shot over the gumballs as they peel out from in front of the bank. Gale is driving, and Evelle starts pawing through one of the sacks when a thought registers with Gale and Evelle at the same moment. They look at each other, and they both twist frantically to look in the back seat. Bellowing, KA-POP! With a loud flat crack, something detonates in the front seat, and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue paint.",
    "1252": "The car drives off down the chic Parisian street, and Andy stares out of the window with a melancholy expression on her face, not looking at Miranda who sits beside her. In a flashback, Irv is seen looking at the list. Andy turns and looks at Miranda, frowns, shakes her head, then turns and looks out of the window. The two women stare at one another before Miranda puts on a pair of large sunglasses, smiles at Andy, and steps out of the car. A swarm of photographers are waiting hungrily outside the entrance of a grand building. Andy gets out of the car and watches Miranda as she makes her way through the throng. Andy ponders for a moment, then turns and walks off in the opposite direction. Expecting Andy to be behind her, Miranda turns back to address her, looks around in confusion, then sees her young assistant striding off across the road. Looking slightly perturbed, Miranda carries on inside. Andy walks towards an ornate green and gold fountain and throws her phone into it. With a smile on her face, Andy strolls off along the Place de la Concorde as the Eiffel Tower is just visible in the distance. The scene shifts to New York City, where the Manhattan and Brooklyn suspension bridges stretch across the East River through the endless sprawl of buildings. A casually-dressed Andy is sitting in a coffee shop reading a newspaper when she looks up as Nate walks in and sits down in front of her. Andy stares down for a moment, then looks at Nate earnestly, while Nate gazes into Andy's sad eyes with a smile flickering across his lips. He leans back in his seat, nods, and Andy looks down wistfully before smiling. Nate shrugs, and Andy looks up at him, with Nate beaming at her. Andy smiles back, then looks down coyly, then gapes. As she walks down a set of steps leading to the pavement, a smile spreads across her face. Dressed in smart jeans, a black polo neck, and a brown jacket, and still wearing a large grin, Andy walks down a busy street, takes a mobile phone from her bag, and begins to dial. Emily gapes in surprise, then composes herself, hangs up looking genuinely touched, and allows herself a brief smile before looking over at Andy's replacement. Out on the street, Andy's smile fades as she sees Miranda leaving the building. Miranda finishes talking on her mobile as a silver Mercedes pulls up. As Miranda, wearing large Jackie O-style sunglasses, makes to get into the car, she suddenly spots Andy standing across the street. The two women regard each other for a moment, then Andy smiles and raises her hand in a wave.",
    "929": "As Bond walks calmly down the corridor, Greene and his party are hurrying for an exit, and they come face to face. On stage, guns are drawn, and the hero is shot as men chase Bond. He runs through a crowded restaurant, and shots are fired, taking down a bystander. Bond waits in ambush, and a pursuer engages in a gun battle in the restaurant. Bond escapes into the kitchen area, where a man body checks him, but Bond shoots him pointblank through the body. He ducks as a door flies open in front of him and tips over a pan of oil, which bursts into flames, allowing him to get past the gunman as the hero dies bloodily on stage. He marches the man away with a gun at his neck, holding him at the edge of a roof. Greene gets in his car, and Bond's prisoner tries to break free, but Bond sends him off the roof, and he lands on Greene's car. Bond straightens his tuxedo as the grim driver gets out and finishes him. In London, an operator is looking at Bond's photos, and M stares at her screen, registering surprise. He walks pensively away from the desk, then goes back, grins, and walks off. Bond is in the back of a powerboat flying an Italian flag at the stern, heading towards a promontory topped by a grand villa overlooking the turquoise blue sea. Bond approaches a stout wooden door, but she can't walk off, so he drops photos on the table and helps himself to white wine. Bond grins as Mathis looks up at his glamorous younger woman, and Bond drains a glass. In a bar on a plane, he looks at a picture of the dead Vespa, picks up a necklace from the bar, and sips a martini. Mathis joins him, and Bond slips the photo into his pocket as they study one another. Bond stays at the bar, and then he and Mathis move through immigration where a redhead in a raincoat stands waiting. They get in a taxi which drives through the busy downtown traffic and gets down from the taxi as Fields strides into a rundown hotel. Bond heads back to the taxi and she obeys, tight-lipped. The statue of an eagle spreads its wings beneath a blue sky dusted with clouds as they are still bickering and are led through the airy tile and marble halls. Bond casually tosses the keys on a sofa and strides through the spacious, modern furnishings eyed by Fields. She stands looking lost while he casts a critical eye over the bedroom and marble en-suite bathroom. He takes off his jacket, walks into the bathroom, Fields grins, and goes to the bedroom. Bond answers the door naked.",
    "714": "He and Rose run through swinging doors into a white corridor, then stop. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator, then scans the area around himself, and peers in a door's round window. Rose rushes down the corridor. They turn a corner and stop at a closed door. Jack opens a different door. They step inside as Lovejoy turns the corner and tries to open the door. Inside, Rose holds her hands to her ears. Jack peers down a ladder at rising smoke. In the boiler room, men shovel coal into the furnaces. Near them, Jack helps Rose down the ladder. Jack and Rose run through the smoky boiler room, past men shoveling coal, as one man turns to watch them run past. Rose and Jack run through drifting smoke until a metal door opens. Jack and Rose step through it and into the cargo hold. They look around themselves as they walk past crates and stacks of boxes. Leading Rose by the hand, Jack hurries around a stack of crates, then stops at a gleaming black car. He lets go of Rose's hand, then peers inside the car. Jack steps around Rose to the passenger door, holds out his hand, and opens the door. Rose takes his hand and steps up into the passenger compartment. Jack shuts the door. As Rose glances around herself, Jack steps into the open-sided driver's seat. Rose pulls down a glass partition, reaches over Jack's shoulders, then pulls him into the passenger compartment. Sitting on the seat, Jack puts his arm around Rose. They gaze into each other's eyes as they interlock their fingers. Rose lays her head on Jack's shoulder, then kisses his fingertips. She places Jack's hand on her breast, and they kiss. The Titanic leaves a long wake in the dark ocean. In a metal crow's nest attached to a mast, Murdoch, with his collar up, peers over the railing outside the wheelhouse. In the backseat of the car, Rose slaps her hand against the back window, then slowly slides it downward. Naked and his face dripping with sweat, Jack lies on top of Rose. He breathes heavily as they gaze at each other and kiss. Rose strokes Jack's hair, then kisses his forehead. He lays his head on her chest. Two stewards with flashlights step down a short corridor and into the cargo hold. Cal opens the safe, pulls out a note and Jack's portfolio, as Lovejoy approaches. Cal opens the portfolio and studies the drawing of Rose, reads the note, and his forehead tenses as he closes, then opens his eyes, glancing at the note again. In the hold, the two stewards creep toward the car, and one steward shines his flashlight in the car's steamed-up windows.",
    "125": "She leads him towards the door, and on the way, he picks up his hat. In the background, Dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and Neff move close to the door, and Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. They look at each other, and the look is like a long kiss. Then, Neff goes out with a briefcase under his arm and comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola, who wears a coat but no hat. Lola gives him a sly smile, and Neff is a little annoyed. Neff gets into the car, puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat, closes the door, and starts the car. They drift down the hill, and Neff looks at Lola curiously, while Lola meets his glance. Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb, turns around, and looks towards the car. Zachetti walks towards the car, and Lola has opened the door. Zachetti comes up, and Lola steps out of the car, catching up with Zachetti, and they walk away together. Slowly, Neff puts the car in gear and drives on, his face tight. Behind his head, light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. There is a fair amount of activity, but the place is not crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot, passing in front of the fruit and vegetable display and going between the stalls into the market. He stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of cigarettes. As he is opening the pack, he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market, where the shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise, and customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section, with her basket partly filled. She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm. Phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer passes and goes on out of the scene. Phyllis and Neff are now very close, and during the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other. She hesitates, then opens it, and Neff looks around quickly, slips the policy out of his pocket, and drops it into her bag.",
    "829": "She turns to face the camera and undoes the ties on her dressing gown. She takes a deep breath and drops the gown to the floor. She does a big, cheesy grin as the camera takes a picture, then frowns and shakes her head. She sets up the camera again and tries a variety of poses, attempting to be sexy. She rips a cute kitten poster off the wall. She prints out one of the photos, puts it in an envelope, and writes Cal’s name on the envelope. She stops decorating the envelope. She opens the front door to find a bunch of lilies. Jessica picks up the bunch of flowers and reads the note. She shakes her head and stares out into the night. Cal is doing guerrilla gardening again. Cal puts the tools back in the shed. From in the house, Cal turns towards the house. He watches as Molly and Robbie hurry to the table. Emily traipses through the house to another room. She picks up a phone and dials. In the garden, Cal takes his phone out. Cal eyes Emily nervously. Cal watches Emily, who is not in the basement at all. Emily smiles. Cal's eyes are full of tenderness. Emily hangs up and looks down sadly. Cal hangs up, still watching her from the garden. Emily heads back to the kids. The wheels of a trolley rotate on a shiny floor. Cal is in a DIY store with Robbie and Molly. Cal picks up a wooden trellis. Jacob is in a wine shop. Jacob turns to Hannah. He pinches her nose, then kisses her. They head off. In Jessica's bedroom, her mom, Claire, is putting away clean laundry. As she puts something in her drawer, she spots the envelope. She takes it out to see Cal's name written on it in big letters. She opens the envelope and partially pulls out the photo from inside. She gasps, horrified. Emily drives her SUV along her leafy, suburban street and turns into her driveway. Robbie is standing in the front garden. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. He waves. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. Claire comes down the stairs in a state of shock. Bernie is sitting on the couch, watching TV. Bernie takes a swig of Coca-Cola. Claire grabs Bernie's shoulder from behind the couch and hands him the envelope. Bernie gives Claire a little frown and turns back to the TV. Absentmindedly, he opens the envelope and glances down at the photo. He freezes. There are several photos in there. He goes through them. His jaw goes slack. Jessica, who is lying on the floor nearby, spots the envelope. Bernie races her from the couch to the door.",
    "233": "Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks out. There are views of the city, but in the street below, opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at his sentry-box. Michal comes up behind Szpilman, makes for the door, nods, and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman takes in the room, sees the piano, is still for a moment, then goes to it. He sits on the piano stool, adjusts its height, opens the lid, removes a cloth covering the keys, gazes lovingly at the keyboard, and flexes his fingers. Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays passionately. Snow falling. Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then opened. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash. In whispers, Szalas and Szpilman shake hands. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours, gives the others their vodka. Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses, unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread, takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. Szalas goes to the window, looks out. Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops, grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes. The padlock is locked on the other side. Sunshine floods in through the windows. Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill. The sound of the padlock. Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. In whispers, Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently. She starts for the door, and he leaves. The padlock sound. Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow. He focuses on her, smiles, then suddenly winces with pain. She looks at him, barely audible. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight. The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted—women, an old man with a stick.",
    "560": "A limo is parked beside a private airliner that bears the Donovan corporate logo. Brody peers inside to Donovan and Indy, who opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. Their journey is SUPERIMPOSED over a map tracing a course from New York City to Venice, Italy. Indy and Brody disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other gondoliers steer their boats in the water. Suddenly, a woman with attractive features, blonde hair, and bright, intelligent eyes approaches Indy, looking at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious. Indy grins, enjoying the repartee. The woman turns to Brody, who tips his hat. She introduces herself as Dr. Elsa Schneider and extends her hand to Brody. Indy's grin fades, and Brody registers a look of surprise. Indy, Brody, and Elsa walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on either side. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor and holds it out to Elsa. She hands Indy a slip of paper, which he then extends to Brody. Elsa leads them into a large piazza where people walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building, arriving at the front steps of the library. Elsa leads the way inside, and their heels click across the marble floor. Indy and Brody notice that the library contains many stained-glass windows. Elsa indicates four huge marble columns that go from floor to ceiling. Indy glances at the columns, then notices a stained-glass window depicting a Knight of the Crusades, lingering for a moment in front of the window. Once Elsa is out of earshot, Indy quickly whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed on the airplane. Brody glances at the Diary and then at the window, noticing that the Roman numerals in question are part of the window's design. Indy's eyes dart across the walls and ceilings, charged with the thrill of discovery as they travel up one of the four huge marble columns. He points to the stained-glass window, discovering that each column is numbered with a Roman numeral. Indy hurries toward Column VII, points again to the stained-glass window, and looks down at the scrap of paper in his hands. He walks past aisles of book-lined shelves, stops, turns, and looks down. He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a loft, looking down at Brody and Elsa. Indy then rushes down the staircase and goes to the center tile where the two sides of the X intersect.",
    "1374": "Fred you said. They roll around fighting on the floor, and the crowd cheers. The room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione, and she smiles. Dumbledore approaches the blue flame, and it glows red. A name comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously. The Durmstrang crowd cheers. Another name comes out. The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes out. Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage. People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more, and another name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads. Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts in and grabs Harry. Harry is silent. A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well-groomed and dressed colorfully. The four Triwizard champions are stood together in a group. She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands. She takes Harry by the hand into a closet. An owl flies in with a letter for Harry; he takes it and begins to read. The owl nips Harry's finger. The fire flares up a little, a face appears in it. Ron enters the room. Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again, but Sirius is gone. Neville waves. Hermione and Ron walk up to them. Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry are not on speaking terms with each other. Hermione walks up to Harry. Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest. Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big red flower. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid. Harry does as he's told. A huge flame fires up. We're zoomed in on a badge; it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow background. As Harry walks along, other pupils aim insults at him, saying he stinks. A young boy runs past. Harry gets to a doorway; two pupils stand in his way. They laugh, and Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric, who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl off more insults. Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them. Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree. Harry walks away, and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret. Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry, and he laughs. Eventually, it comes back out, and McGonagall turns Draco back to normal. Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him. Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.",
    "984": "Robert and Caroline stroll through to the back as Daisy goes to the front doors. They gaze at each other, and a smile plays on Benjamin's lips as Daisy frowns. She strides past him to the windowed office, turns to him, and closes the door. Benjamin follows Daisy through a bright corridor to the back entrance, where outside, they share a look. Daisy turns and strolls to Robert's beige SUV, and Benjamin watches as she gets in. Her eyes remain fixed on Benjamin as Robert reverses onto the road, and Benjamin stands beneath a concrete canopy studded with lights, watching as the vehicle drives away. A strong wind buffets the hospital as Caroline returns to the diary. Benjamin opens his hotel room door to Daisy, who lowers her eyes as she steps over the threshold, and he closes the door of room 325. They stand in profile, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room, and she nods. Daisy reaches out and gently strokes Benjamin's smooth cheek, and he tenderly massages her left shoulder. He draws her closer, and they hold each other tightly. He looks her in the eye and gently slides her coat off her shoulders. A TV set is in the room, and wearing only a bra and knickers, Daisy stands with her back to Benjamin, who's propped up in bed. He watches as she pulls her black leotard on, puts her coat on, and turns to face him. He looks at her with an air of sadness as she strolls to his hotel room door and leans on the windowsill as she walks to a taxi. Daisy gets into a yellow taxi outside her large, white house, and the cab pulls away. Now in her late 60s, Daisy addresses the cab driver as the taxi approaches the stately, white-clapboard edifice of the retirement home. An elderly black man sits at a table in the courtyard, sketching, as wrapped in a shawl, Daisy ambles up nearby and smiles weakly as she looks around. Daisy enters the building via the back door, where Queenie's daughter beckons her into the room. A bearded man with a name tag rises and gives her the diary. Daisy looks down, then turns on hearing a piano. She walks into the communal living area, where a figure is hunched over the keyboard of the piano. David and Queenie's daughter hover as Daisy approaches the figure, who turns and stares vacantly. He's a child of about 12, and she reaches out, but Benjamin recoils. He turns and looks at her, with cropped, sandy hair and acne. Daisy blinks and takes a slow, inward breath as she takes a seat beside him, and he narrows his eyes. She shakes her head, recalling when she was drying his hair with a towel, and little Benjamin stands on the high, gray-slate rooftop.",
    "371": "The man is none other than. The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence. He's genuinely proud. Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, firing both into the ceiling. Screams all around. The skinny security guard makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. The guard takes out his gun and slides it over. The teller woman nods. Angle on Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The teller woman is already waving him to the back. He decides he better go. The teller woman is crying as she works the combination. Edward feels horrible. She pulls open the vault door. The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair. Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies. Caught, Edward has to confess. Edward continues his narration. Norther leans in the driver's side window. Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in. The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the last moment, Norther calls out. Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip. We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's quiet, except for the distant splashing of water from the spigot. Edward's eyes are closed. A long beat. Another. Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find sitting on the edge of the tub. He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub. A beat while she considers. Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind. When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes. He wipes them away. Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash. He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. Something doesn't make sense. She hands him five dollars out of her pocket. He's out the door in a flash. While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will. A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. She's a tangle of conflicting emotions. Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.",
    "550": "But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse. Fedora and his men arrive at the roof's edge in time to see Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off. Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles, and a vintage truck and automobile come roaring out from behind the Pueblo, driven by two more gang members. The passenger in the car has his face concealed by the hat's wide brim, but his arm is out the window, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. Indy spurs his mount on to greater speeds, but the autos not only keep pace with his horse. Indy veers off in a new direction toward a railroad track. The train is barreling down the track. Indy rides up beside it and he leaps from horse to train. He clings to the side of a boxcar as Halfbreed and Rough Rider leap from the truck onto the train. Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him, but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar. Indy loses his balance but regains it. With Halfbreed and Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap door of and finds himself crawling on a catwalk suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are numerous vats containing all manner of reptiles: alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc. Then, Halfbreed enters through the trap door, followed by Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp. Indy crawls away toward an opening on the opposite side. Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we see large bins of squirming snakes. The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the bolts begin to rip from. Several bolts tear free, but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that drops down. He lands hard, with a splash into a vat of water where he finds himself eye-to-eye with an enormous anaconda. The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Roscoe appears atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to. Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. Roscoe follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar. As a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a huge black rhinoceros.",
    "1281": "She spots a razor and a shaving brush. He looks at her defiantly. She sighs and, carrying a washing basket, runs downstairs. Red and blue lights flash outside, as she crosses to the front door. A blonde woman in a blue top is standing among the group of police officers. Helen looks shocked. Motorcycle outriders prepare to escort the waiting car. A stern-faced woman with dark hair sits in the front seat. The blonde woman puts her arms protectively around the bemused Jacob. The convoy of two cars and four motorcycles pulls away. Lights flashing, they speed down rain-soaked streets. He points to the road ahead. Beyond the outriders, their side of the highway is empty. She stares at the expressionless agent who stares straight ahead ignoring her. More vehicles join the convoy rolling down the empty nighttime highway. Military vehicles and personnel maneuver as gates open to admit them. A Chinook helicopter stands outside a large hangar. The convoy pulls up at an aircraft. It's loaded rack down. The agent ushers the stunned Helen towards the helicopter. Inside, it's packed with soldiers and some civilians. Helen finds a space and sits down nervously. She looks across at a man with a dark, bushy beard. The twin rotor helicopter lifts off into the dark night sky. Floodlights illuminate a sports field teeming with equipment and personnel. The chopper lands mid-field. A soldier carries a heavy machine gun on his shoulder. As police cars escort more vehicles through the military throng, soldiers push racks of protective clothing along a walkway. A NASA space agency logo adorns the screen in a large lecture theater. It's on a collision course with the Earth. Graphics show impact location Manhattan. Helen stares. The screen shows one hour 18 minutes 43 seconds. The time is counting down. She tentatively opens the toilet cubicle door. She looks nervously at the woman in military uniform and nods. Choppers hurtle towards the bright lights of Manhattan. Helen looks shocked and stares out of the window of the chopper at the city lights. Helen and Yusef hold hands as the scientists brace themselves. Helen opens her eyes. A bright ball of light is moving through the dark sky above the illuminated city. It passes behind the towering Empire State Building. It illuminates the bell gothic façade of Saint Patrick's Cathedral and moves with swirling brilliance towards Central Park. Trees cast eerie shadows across the grass as people gather and stare up in horror. As Helen stares out of the chopper window at the object sinking towards the ground, powerful blasts of energy slow its descent, generating clouds of billowing vapor. The watching crowds are silhouetted in its intense light. The draft from the object's descent causes a tsunami of wind and vapor.",
    "695": "Harry smiles and winks, but a truck briefly blocks Peter's view, and when it passes, Harry has disappeared from the coffee shop. Peter turns and looks around the street, eyes wide, mouth half open. Later, he sits on the bed in his room, hands clasped between his knees, staring ahead with a cold and malevolent expression. Slowly, his eyes swivel to the corner of the room, and he turns his head toward the black trunk on the floor of the closet. Lightning flashes in a dark sky. In his father's study, Harry pours himself a martini and adds a couple of olives. Sensing Peter behind him, he smiles without looking around and sips his drink. Peter, wearing the black suit under his normal clothes, punches Harry. Peter's eyes widen as Harry stabs him in the thigh with a dagger. As they fight, a row of curved blades shoot out from Harry's forearm. Peter hauls him into a pummeled wall, and Harry swings at it, smashing his arm at Peter's head, but the blades get stuck in the pillar behind. Peter slams his fist down on Harry's arm, breaking off the blades. Harry kicks him across the table, and they circle each other. Peter kicks Harry through a glass partition, and Harry wipes blood from his mouth, diving at Peter who hauls him against another window. Peter throws Harry across the room, and Harry picks himself up. They run at each other and crash through into the secret goblin lair. As Peter chases him through the lair, Harry picks up the goblin sword and swings it at him, but Peter dodges the blade. Harry accidentally cuts through the table, tethering the sky stick, sending it spinning out of control. Peter pushes Harry's head up into the path of the sky stick, and Harry is thrown against a wall of glass shelves, crashing to the ground. Peter floors Harry with a final blow and walks away. Harry finds a pumpkin bomb and hurls it after him, but Peter lassos the bomb with a web and hauls it back, exploding in Harry's face. Peter strolls along a street, fastening his shirt collar over the Black Spider-Man suit, and several women passing by give him the eye. At a newsstand, the Daily Bugle photo shows Black Spider-Man robbing a bank. In the Bugle office, Brock is celebrating and hangs up a framed blowup of the front page. Peter comes up behind him and drops a photo on the desk, slamming Brock against the wall. Brock looks around, smiling nervously. Peter hands Robby, the sub-editor, the original print from which Brock faked the bank robbery shot. In Jameson's office, Jameson slaps the photo down. Floppy-haired Peter is in his hallway with Ursula.",
    "446": "At dusk, the electric lights are on when suddenly Don pounds the bar and explodes, leaving the bar silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs and ham. Nat brings over a plate of ham and eggs, pours a jiggerful, and Don downs it. Nat fills it again, sits down to his ham and eggs, drinks his jiggerful, and taps the glass on the bar. From the street, Gloria enters wearing a shirtwaist and skirt, a foolish little hat, and high-heeled shoes with bows. He pours another drink as a round-faced, middle-aged man with pince-nez enters the bar. With his thumb, Nat indicates Gloria, and the man takes a couple of steps towards the door, then turns with a Guide of New York sticking from his pocket and walks out, bewildered. He downs the jigger of rye, and Nat breaks down and pours a drink. He takes off his hat, shakes the rain from it, peels off his raincoat, and is wearing a bowler and a straight raincoat. A crowd of people streams into the building, doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel. With a quick gesture, he transfers a bottle to the pocket of his raincoat and rolls the raincoat up like swaddling clothes. In his suit's side pocket is a pint of liquor. Among the crowd is Don Birnam, who hands his coat to an attendant, his eyes lingering on its pocket with a certain tenderness before he turns and starts towards the auditorium door. Seeing an opening in the line at the cloak room counter, he steps into it and sits about five seats from the aisle between an elderly daughter and her age-old mother, and a middle-aged man and wife, glancing through the program as the curtain rises, changing the light on the group. Don looks up, thirst in his eyes, looks away from the stage, and tries to concentrate on the Metropolitan's ceiling, while powdered footmen pour wine into the glasses of the over-vivacious guests. Alfred and Violetta bat the drinking song back and forth as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands swaying, echoing each couplet. Don's imagination works at top speed as the first drops of sweat gather on his forehead, and he takes a handkerchief from his pocket to wipe it. The swaying echelon of choristers slowly dissolves to a row of raincoats like the one Don wore, hanging from hangers and swaying to Verdi's rhythm, as his eyes remain glued to the stage.",
    "1333": "The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. The camera rises up to find Javert, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed and expressionless. Behind Javert, through the storm rain, there is a glimpse of a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. In the foreground, convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, laboring in the crashing spray. With a last great heave, the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. Javert stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labor beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. Javert approaches Jean Valjean, seeing him and pointing his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a moment, defying him, then drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. He makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back, and strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close around him against the cold winter wind. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, where he sees, lit by the rising sun, a wide vista of fields and towns and villages stretching into the distance, with the snow-capped Alps beyond. He passes a long line of laborers working and approaches the overseer. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap. Bewildered, fearful, and suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church, where there is a simple table on which are laid bread and wine with silver cutlery. The bishop's sister, Madame Baptistine, stands, and two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. Valjean hesitates, and the Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. The old Bishop holds out the two silver candlesticks, and Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes them. Amazed, Valjean looks up, and silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. Valjean takes out his yellow passport and stares at it, then kneels in the church. Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church.",
    "826": "David is mowing the grass, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt with a deep V, and he grins back at Emily, who licks her lips salaciously. Cal wakes with a jolt, gets up, and a ball falls from a tree in Emily's garden as Cal falls out of the branches of the tree. He remains stock still and regards the house intently, then waters the flower beds, glances back at the house, and prunes one of the rose bushes. He treads over the lawn with shoes with long metal spikes on the bottom, trims the hedge, treads over the lawn the other way, and sidles across it. A security light comes on, he freezes, and then he makes a run for it. Cal plays catch with Robbie; they both wear baseball gloves, Robbie nods, and Cal raises his brows, squints at Robbie, and lobs the ball at him, who catches it in his glove and beams before throwing it back. Jessica's parents, ex-friend Bernie, and Claire are there as Cal sits on a chair alone in a corridor, his brow furrowed, staring ahead, and glancing to his right as Emily approaches from the other direction. Cal stands as she smiles shyly, and he beams brightly at her. They both take a seat on either side of a door in front of the lockers, shuffle awkwardly in their seats, and both knot and unknit their fingers. Cal looks down at the floor, nods, looks down, shakes his head, and Emily takes a deep breath as Cal smiles serenely before his expression becomes serious. Emily's eyes well with tears as Kate forces a grin, yanks the door angrily, closes her eyes, takes a deep, calming breath, stands, and touches her temple gently. Emily smiles coldly, turns to face Cal, gawks at him, and he raises his brow but looks down. She opens and closes her mouth, nods her head, and Cal shakes his head and stares at his feet, sighs, and a gentle smile creeps across his face as tearfully, Emily smiles. A crowd has gathered, Cal turns to Emily sheepishly, and she glares at him as he hangs his head, shakes it, looks up, and his eyes dart around. Emily walks away, and Cal turns to watch her go as Emily gets into her car and drives off. Bernie and Claire walk away as it starts to rain. Jacob sits alone in his smart, minimalist apartment eating a bowl of cereal and studying the packet, with a large black and white abstract painting hanging behind him. Emily drives through the night, shaking her head in disbelief at the wheel and blinks and sighs heavily as Cal leans against his car outside the school and lets the rain soak him.",
    "838": "Diana helps Sandy up and pushes him aside as the car accelerates. Diana rolls up the windshield and falls to the pavement. Pushing the airbag away, the skiptracer sees a squad car speeding straight at him. As he turns, a car T-bones him. Sandy kneels over Diana. Sandy's face tenses. She startles awake. She punches him in the throat. Sandy flails backward. Sitting up, Diana sees a squad car speed by, then glances behind them. Squad cars surround the skiptracer. An officer hops out with his pistol drawn. The skiptracer sits back, dazed. They arrest him as Sandy and Diana scurry away unseen. They exit the overpass through a construction gate and down a staircase. Now, in a parking lot, Sandy and Diana stagger toward the Chevy Caprice. He looks off as she enters the car. Now, with St. Louis behind them, Sandy cruises along with a joyful grin as Diana sleeps. Later, the sun rises in a pale orange sky. In broad daylight, Sandy drives through rural farmland. He checks the fuel gauge on a country highway. Sandy keeps his tired eyes on the road. Glancing over, he startles as Diana sleeps with her glazed eyes wide open. Sandy gently closes her eyelids and her head falls into his lap. He yanks her up by the hair and Diana's mouth hangs open. Our view quickly rises into the sky, following the sun through a full day. At sunset, they cruise toward the Denver skyline. At night, Sandy parks the beat-up car outside his apartment and enters with Diana. His daughters run into his arms. Sandy's brow rises at his approaching wife. They share a long, loving kiss as Diana enters, her sheepish eyes averted to the floor. She connects eyes with Trish. The young girls extend their hands. Diana shifts her gaze to Sandy, who flashes a grin. Now, the Pattersons eat dinner with Diana. Trish looks at her husband, who glances at their guest and takes a bite. Sitting across from Diana, Sandy's daughters stare warily at her. Diana smears potatoes on her forehead. Jessie plops food onto her forehead with a fork. Later, Trish dries dishes in the kitchen. Diana timidly walks in and puts her hand on the counter. She removes it and straightens. Diana shifts her weight and steps closer. She outlines her groin and chest. Trish awkwardly blinks at her. Diana starts to go, then turns back. She gazes earnestly at Diana. The redhead leaves the kitchen. Watching her go, Trish clutches a plate and drying cloth. Her gaze wanders to the floor. Now, in bed, Sandy lies on his side. He rolls to his right and sidles up next to his wife, who lightly touches his shoulder.",
    "873": "Zoe returns to watching the black-and-white gangster movie on the TV, her eyes darting around as she thinks. Suddenly, she rises resolutely from the sofa, strides out of the open-plan lounge and down the hallway, past the double doors opening onto Kate's desk, ignoring Kate, who remains at her desk. In her room, Zoe sits on her bed with a scarlet-haired smiling rag doll resting on her drawn-up knees, pulls up the doll's striped skirt and red polka dot top, considers the words with downcast eyes, then replaces the doll's clothing, and stares into the doll's face. Wearing a white dressing gown and with damp hair, Kate strides down the hallway and is later outside Zoe's school. They drive around in Nick's blue pickup truck, and Kate holds her hand to her mouth, runs her hand through her hair, moves around to the side of Zoe's bed, catching sight of the cuddly toys on her pillow, considers them briefly, then picks up the furry kangaroo. They drive past leafless trees into the bleak, deserted cemetery, where Zoe returns the hug that Kate has given her. Both crying, Kate kisses Zoe's cheek and gently wipes away her tears before the pair separate. Zoe mouths an acknowledgment, then turns to pick up her red rucksack, and they stand. Kate brushes off her long, black coat and takes Zoe's hand as they walk away from the grave towards Nick, who's been watching from a distance. Amid the faded flowers on the grave is Zoe's peacock feather, fluttering in the breeze. Nick drives Zoe and Kate home, and as he pulls up, Zoe turns to him. Kate and Zoe climb out of the truck, and Kate hands her the keys. Nick offers his hand, which Kate takes, her eyes fixing longingly on him. Nick squeezes her hand, she pulls away, closes the door, and looks at Nick through the window. Kate stands alone in the sunlit street as a truck drives away. In the busy restaurant kitchen, Bernadette reenters, and brandishing an uncooked steak held high on a carving fork, Kate marches out of the kitchen through the dining room and up to table seven. Kate tears off her apron, thrusts it at a waiter, and strides out. Paula stares blankly as Kate hails a cab and gets in. On her therapist's roof terrace overlooking Manhattan, Kate turns and eyes the man with realization. In a shabby elevator, Kate clutches a copper saucepan wrapped in a tea towel, steps out onto a landing lined with a discarded metal trolley and window grill, hesitates, then knocks. Without taking his eyes off Kate, Nick steps back from the door, revealing an open-plan loft apartment beyond.",
    "206": "George comes running into shot as the wind blows as it has all through this sequence. He is frantically looking for Clarence and leans on the bridge railing, praying as he sobs. Suddenly, the wind dies down and a soft, gentle snow begins to fall. A police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into the scene. George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again but then touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, and laughs happily, his rapture knowing no bounds. He practically embraces the astonished Bert and then runs at top speed toward town. George's wrecked car is smashed against a tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on. He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town, passing some late shoppers on the street. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. George notices a light in Potter's office window and races across the street, where Potter is seated working at his desk with his goon by his side. George pounds on the window and runs off as Potter looks up from his work. The lights are on, the Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around, and Carter the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door, grabs his hand and shakes it, and the photographer sets off a flash bulb. George runs to the kitchen, gets no answer, and comes running back to the hall where the three children are at the top of the stairs in their pajamas. George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand, which he kisses lovingly before putting it back and continuing up the stairs. George hugs the kids as Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom and he crushes her to him. As Mary comes through the door breathless and excited, the four men are watching with open mouths. Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce embrace, and they embrace tearfully. He stops her with a kiss and she leads him excitedly down the stairs. Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree. She runs toward the front door and flings it open as ad lib sounds of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in.",
    "763": "David sits up and puts his head on one side quizzically, turns to see the weights on the ends of the bar, and Joseph walks up to him. David twists around to look at the other end of the bar while Joseph watches tensely. Joseph takes several paces back towards an open covered door. On the bench, David grips his hands out wider than his shoulders and takes the weight, drops the bar slowly to his chest, and pushes up until his arms are straight. He lowers the bar again and straightens his arms, while Joseph stares. Finally, David drops the bar back onto the supports. David's hands wrap around the bar slowly feeling for the optimum grip since even more weights have been clamped to the bar this time. David is frowning slightly, and Joseph stands in the cupboard. On his bench, David braces himself and lowers the bar to his chest. Arms quivering, eyes tight shut, face twisted, he presses it up to full extension, repeats the press, and replaces the bar. Above the bar, Joseph's white face appears upside down to David, standing two steps up the staircase. As the bar rises, two big paint cans appear taped to it next to the weights. David drops the bar back in its supports, his left arm flops to the floor, but with his right still gripping the bar, he holds himself upright. Joseph comes down the stairs and walks slowly over to David, who twists around to inspect the weights and the paint cans at either end of the bar. David's brow furrows, and Joseph gazes at him in awe. Elijah is lying in a hospital bed and nods almost imperceptibly. Inside, Audrey is sorting through papers on a reception desk as a nurse approaches her and points across the room. Audrey hands the nurse a yellow file, takes another one from her, and walks across the open-plan office. She leans through a doorway and smiles, sitting on a low couch in a treatment room. She looks up at Elijah, who's watching her from his wheelchair, and a metal frame keeps his right leg straight. The street outside the stadium is empty, and inside, along one of the shaded walkways, David, in his security uniform, leans on a wall, casually watching spectators as they crowd in through a gate. He looks away, stares at the ground, and after a moment, pushes himself off the wall, moves to the center of the walkway with his head down and hands in his pockets. The crowd streams past him, laughing and smiling. They jostle and bump him, some almost pushing him aside, but he doesn't react. A large woman in a pink coat, with blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, dragging a small boy by the hand, bangs into him.",
    "736": "Rose leans forward and spits while her mother and her friends stroll nearby. As Ruth steps up, Rose taps Jack's arm, prompting him to turn around and swallow. Rose steps towards her mother, then glances at Jack, and Molly, smiling at Jack, points to her own chin. Jack quickly wipes saliva off his own chin and waves as Rose and her mother walk off. Jack lifts his hands and shrugs. Elsewhere, Molly helps Jack into a black tuxedo jacket, and they gaze into a full-length mirror. At dusk, the Titanic trails black smoke from its four smoke stacks as it sails toward the setting sun. Later, a steward opens a door for Jack, who is wearing a white tie and shirt, and he smiles at the steward as he steps inside. He pauses, then walks toward an ornate railing and columns beneath the dome skylight. Jack steps to the railing and gazes down at a couple descending the ship's grand staircase, then glances up at the skylight and walks down the staircase to the landing where he studies a wall clock with an elaborately carved wooden casing. Jack descends past a winged statue, observing couples in formal evening wear strolling or chatting. He leans against a column, then notices a bearded man standing erect with his left arm behind his back. Jack stands up straight and places his own arm behind his back, nodding to the man as he and a woman stroll past. Jack watches the couple, then gazes up the staircase as Cal and Ruth descend toward him, with Cal eyeing Jack as they step past him. From the staircase's landing, Rose gazes down at Jack, who pretends to shake somebody's hand, practicing to be a gentleman. Jack turns and looks up at Rose, who is wearing a floor-length black lace dress. She smiles and descends the stairs toward him. Rose stops a few steps above Jack, who takes her white gloved hand and kisses it, then holds out his bent right arm for Rose, who takes it. She smiles as he tilts back his chin, nose in the air, and arm-in-arm, they stroll up to Cal. Cal and Ruth step arm-in-arm toward the reception room, with Rose smiling at Jack as they follow. Later, Rose and Jack descend another wide, curving staircase, passing a dark-haired woman speaking with a white-haired man, who gaze toward a group of people. Molly takes Jack's other arm as Rose, Jack, and Molly step into the large dining room. Mustached Astor returns as Jack and Rose stroll through the dining room and stop at their table. Jack waves his hand while Rose gestures across the table at him to put his napkin in his lap, and Jack gazes down at an array of silverware placed on both sides of the charter holding his plate.",
    "540": "Cafe customers are startled to see Indy and Elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles. Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since Kazim and two other Turkish agents are running towards them with drawn guns. He grabs Elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and leap into a motorboat. Indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock, but not before a Turkish agent jumps in with him. Elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while Indy and the Turk trade punches. Kazim and his men rush to two more speedboats tied to the dock. They chase after Indy. Indy grapples with the Turkish agent. As Indy grips his arms, they see a gun in the agent's hand. It fires. As Indy fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the speedboats behind him and two enormous freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes. Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish agent. Indy finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat. It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the two freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls. One enemy speedboat chases Indy between the two freighters. It's a race for daylight as the two freighters drift ever closer to one another. Indy's speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters, flying into the air and splashing back down into the water. They spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see Kazim's speedboat appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, firing a machine gun at Indy and Elsa. The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A chattering machine gun from Kazim's boat splinters the wood of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat catches. The machine gun runs out of ammunition. Kazim puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish agents in the boat with him. As Indy's boat drifts toward the giant, turning propellers at the stern of another steamer, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. Indy steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish agents to the deck, then turns his attention to Kazim. The two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water. Indy kicks Kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamer's giant propeller blades.",
    "718": "The mother glances at her young daughter, who nods. The two stewards exchange glances. Murdoch directs sailors lowering lifeboats filled with women and children. As one of the lifeboats tilts to one side, the passengers on board grimace. The sailors level the boat and lower it toward the water. A crewman fires a flare into the night sky. The passengers on deck, including Rose and Cal, gaze up. A young blond girl watches the flares and smiles. The flare explodes into separate fiery streams that fall. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack looks out through a porthole at the water, which almost reaches the middle of the glass. Sitting near Jack, Lovejoy places a bullet on a table and shoves the clip into the handgun. Lovejoy stands. He punches Jack in the stomach. Jack winces. Lovejoy picks up the handcuff key from the table, places it in his breast pocket, and leaves. Molly Brown helps a brunette woman. Cal smiles at Lightoller. Rose watches a tearful woman hug her husband. Ruth scans the passengers on the lifeboat. Ruth turns to Rose and smiles. Rose glares at Cal. Molly stands in the lifeboat. Molly helps Ruth into the boat. Rose's jaw slackens as she stares at Cal. Cal places Rose's life belt in the boat. Ruth and Molly reach toward Rose. Cal gestures. Rose walks away. Cal follows and grabs her. As she steps away, Cal grabs Rose and spins her toward him. Rose spits in Cal's face and runs off. The crewmen lower the lifeboat. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack peers at the water covering the porthole window. He bangs his handcuffs against the water pipe. Water floods a staircase and streams down a long corridor leading to the office. In the first-class corridor, Rose searches for Andrews. In another corridor, Andrews stops a steward and turns to a brunette woman, a blond maid. Andrews checks a passenger cabin. Rose runs to him. Andrews shakes his head. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack drops his head. Water streams in under the door. Jack climbs up the water pipe near the ceiling and bangs the handcuffs against the pipe. Elsewhere, Rose bumps into a steward as she runs to an elevator. As she reaches the elevator, an elevator operator with dark blond hair stops her. Rose shoves the operator into the elevator. The operator pushes a lever down as Rose closes the door. In the office, Jack tries to pull off the handcuffs. In the elevator, Rose's chest heaves. The elevator descends into rising water, which pours into the elevator. Rose opens the elevator doors and steps into a flood corridor. The operator pulls the lever up. Water empties out of the elevator as it rises.",
    "9": "An arrangement of fresh-cut roses in a vase against a white tile wall is seen. Instantly, the tile is sprayed with blood, matching the deep crimson of the roses. Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane. Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops as Jane appears behind him. A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table. Ricky enters the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. He kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face, and Lester looks back; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling a slight smile. Then he smiles, ever so slightly. We're flying across a white blanket of clouds, and eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly as a dot of light falls across an unbelievably starry sky. Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed, looking at each other, alarmed. Maple trees in autumn send ghostly leaves fluttering slowly toward pavement. Angela stands in front of the mirror fixing her make-up, but then turns, frightened. Close-up on an ancient woman's papery hands as they button a cardigan sweater. Carolyn walks slowly toward the red door, drenched to the bone, clutching her purse tightly, while a 1970 Pontiac Firebird is in the driveway of a suburban home and the sun's reflection is in the windshield. The Colonel enters, wet and wearing latex gloves, with blood covering the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of a gun case with the glass door open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside. Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us, while a door opens to reveal four-year-old Jane dressed in a Princess costume, holding a lit sparkler and smiling shyly. Carolyn enters, terrified and still clutching her purse, shuts the door, locks it, then takes out a Glock 19. She opens the closet door, shoves the gun into a hamper, and, aware of Lester's scent, grabs as many of his clothes as she can, burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling several clothing items down with her, and begins to cry. In black and white, a younger Carolyn sits across from us on a spinning teacup ride, laughing uncontrollably as she twists the wheel, making us spin faster. We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier of an empty white plastic bag being blown about, the wind carrying it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it violently, or sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully to the ground.",
    "1204": "Marley's lying next to Connor, and Marley watches him leave and settles back down next to the sleeping lad. He leaves the editor's glass-fronted office, and the children are playing ball in the garden with Jenny when John arrives home. The kids, Jenny, and Marley tackle him to the ground, and John, the boys, and Marley head back to the house. Marley is having difficulty getting up the steps and later falls asleep in the dining room. The windy dog gets up and trots out, prompting John to put on a coat and go back outside. They use torches to search the rainy night, and Jenny switches the light on in the barn. The children are gathered together at a window, and she picks up Colleen with a reassuring smile. Patrick glumly follows his mother as John continues to search outside and walks down the drive towards the post box by the roadside. He flashes the torch around and spots Marley lying by a tree, and the dog whines as John touches his belly. A white-coated vet washes her hands, and close to tears, John leaves the surgery. He steps out onto the street, shrugging on his jacket, and walks, shoulders slumped, towards the car. He puts the key in the door, puts his hands on his hips, and sighs. Later, he arrives home, and she looks at the scrapbook and grins. Resting his cheek on his right hand, John doesn't look at her and examines his other hand, distractedly. Jenny puts an arm around him as he stares at the scrapbook of pasted-in columns. Morning sun shines on the big stone house, and John's asleep, slumped over the scrapbook. He turns to Jenny and smiles, while she slumps against a door frame in relief. Marley bounds across the large lawn and sits down by the road. As the school bus approaches, Marley trots up to the bus as Patrick and Connor get off, and Marley joins in the race. John and Billy walk through town past the tall clock tower of City Hall, and Sebastian and John grin broadly at one another. John looks back as they part, and Sebastian approaches two women. John drops his bag on a chair by the front door near to a baby grand piano, and there's a note on the dining room table. Marley's knocked over the dustbin in the kitchen and is having a feast, so he picks up the bin, and they go for a walk through a sunny meadow bordered by trees with golden autumnal leaves. Marley trots along beside John, who has his hands thrust in his pockets, and they sit down together on the path. John strokes Marley and studies his old friend, and the dog turns and looks at him. They sit, side by side, in the golden evening sun, looking out over the lush valley.",
    "259": "Hi runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store, and a pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane, thundering up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs, with the lead Doberman holding a paper 7-Eleven cap in his teeth. Hi reverses again and emerges into the back aisle, where a pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder with a BANG. Hi looks and sees the Store Manager, a fat man in a white short-sleeved shirt with a lit cigarette in his mouth, standing in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the store. The Manager cracks open his shotgun, inserts two cartridges with a THOONK THOONK into the smoking chamber, and Hi doubles back again toward the back aisle. The Manager is blowing out groceries on the shelves behind Hi as he coolly levels his police special and takes aim. Still on the dead run, Hi flings the carton of Huggies, which rockets straight at the camera, and futilely raising his gun to avoid impact, the carton catches him square on the chest. The force makes him stumble one fatal step backward into the back aisle, where he is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing shopping cart, propelled by an hysterically screaming shopper. Racing on down the back aisle, bellowing, and tracking from in front, beyond her, we see the pack of furiously barking dogs nipping at her heels as Hi emerges through the back door to find Ed skidding around the corner. Hi scrambles in the passenger side, and the car peels out of the lot. With a THWAK, Ed gives him a good hard slap, and Hi's head rolls toward the camera, his eyes fixed on something in the road ahead. Still focused on the road, he is opening his door, even though the car is racing along and absently concedes. In the extreme foreground sits the first carton of Huggies that Hi dropped in the middle of the road as the car approaches. As the car passes the carton, Hi's hand reaches from the passenger door and snags it, pulling the carton in and slamming the door shut. The scene cranes up to the car speeding away as Ed bursts in the front door, holding Nathan Jr. They look up, dumbstruck and mortified from the sofa where they have been watching TV. Ed is unmoved and storms into the bedroom, slamming the door. There is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and Evelle stares at the ceiling, before Evelle finally turns to Hi, his gesture taking in the trailer and the entire domestic situation.",
    "450": "Behind the glass lies the folder of matches, which attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass to one side. The waiter takes the check, which is thrust between his vest and stiff shirt, and puts it face down in front of Don before hurrying on with the tray of drinks. Don turns the check over and puts his hand in his pocket, pulling out what cash he has, but he only has two one-dollar bills and some small change, which isn't enough. At that moment, the waiter returns, expecting to be paid, and takes the check before leaving. Next to Don, a couple is cooing, but on the bench between him and the girl lies her bag. Don thinks there must be some money in the bag as the man whispers something into the girl's ear, and she shakes her head. Don looks around the room, forming a plan, and inadvertently drops his hand on the bench beside the handsome leather bag with gold initials, M. M. The bag moves very close to his coat, and Don imperceptibly pulls it closer to himself, switching his cigarette and crossing his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his coat to his armpit, holding it close to his ribs. Don calmly smokes his cigarette as a great gentleman while the waiter comes back with the drink, and guests and waiters pass by. He points to a door at the other end of the room, and there is a tiny puzzled look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the washroom. The waiter pulls the table away for him, and Don starts to rise. The washroom has two washbasins, with a colored attendant brushing a customer as Don enters, carrying the bag under his open coat by the pressure of his upper arm. Between his fingers is a cigarette, making the whole thing look fairly natural. As Don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes. Don puts down the soap, pulls out the bag, opens it, and finds some bills between a compact, lipstick, and keys. He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in his pocket, and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations. Smiling at the idea that flashes into his mind, he takes one of the carnations, puts it into the purse, closes it, and thrusts it back under his coat. Just as the attendant straightens up, Don puts both hands into the water.",
    "905": "Purvis empties his pistol into the man, and Baby Face drops onto his back as a plume of exhaled steam jets from his nose once. Purvis glares over his aimed pistol. Outside a small-town pharmacy, Dillinger returns to the heisted car, where Red leans, sweating and bloody, in the corner of the back seat. Dillinger pours antiseptic over Red's wounded abdomen, fusses with other supplies, applies gauze to the wound, and Red trains his puffy, exhausted eyes on Dillinger, his feeble smile fading. Dillinger slumps a little, then sits back, his blood-stained hand letting go of Red's shoulder. Eyes downcast, Dillinger stays seated by his deceased partner, swallowing and glancing at Red as his lips give a brief, irritated sneer, and he gazes downward. In a field office, Purvis faces his agents at night. On a city street, a scowling Dillinger drives past a parked car, which reflects electrical flashes from a passing train. Two agents sit in the parked vehicle, one a burly man with a Roman nose, peers at an apartment building across the street, while his partner sleeps. In the apartment, a seated Billie checks her watch, then turns up a radio, and the windows behind her show the passing train. Billie crosses the roomy, run-down apartment, then doubles back to a door, where a woman with similar short hair comes down a staircase, hands Billie a large, brown paper bag, and follows her into the apartment. As Billie dons her fur-collared coat, the newcomer takes Billie's seat by the radio. The woman wears a top similar to Billie's. As she skims a newspaper and turns up the radio, another elevated train passes in the windows. In the car, both G-men watch the apartment. In another car, two more agents see someone in an overcoat and fedora toting a paper bag across a dark alley, and the stranger ducks down a narrow passage and reaches out with a delicate hand to a brick wall—it's Billie in disguise. She comes to a street on the other end, carrying the brown paper bag, steps off the sidewalk between parked cars, and looks around in the middle of the street. A car's headlights illuminate and shine on her anxious face, and a car situated about a block away approaches and comes to a stop. Billie hops in next to Dillinger, who chews gum and smiles. Billie takes off the hat, kisses his cheek, and holds him as Dillinger drives off, and she rests her head on his shoulder. In the field office, Purvis and his agents listen to Madala, then the agents abruptly gaze out the door, and Purvis steps forward, arms folded across his chest. In the outer office, the solemn, burly agent stands with his partner, and as Purvis gazes at them, his eyes water.",
    "888": "Caroline Bingley paces the room, holding an open book in her hands, while Mr. Bingley prods the fire with his foot. Miss Bingley walks over to Darcy, who's engrossed in a book, and flirtatiously leans on his chair in order to read over his shoulder, but he ignores her and turns the page. With malevolent intent in her eyes, she crosses to Lizzie, who looks around her awkwardly, then shuts her book, stands, and sets off, arms linked, around the room with Miss Bingley. Darcy considers this for a moment, and Miss Bingley attempts to break the palpable tension by crossing to the piano as Darcy and Lizzie steadily hold each other's gazes. Jane and Lizzie are in a two-horse carriage as he beams at her, and Bingley steps away from the door, still grinning, raising a hand to bid them farewell. As the carriage leaves, Darcy watches its progress from a window and remains staring out of the window. Now inside the carriage, Jane smiles dreamily. A lady's hand is at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Lizzie is walking through the countryside, with green leaves starting to turn brown, and she watches the progress of geese flying through the sky overhead. At the Bennet's dining table, he gives them a look as an austere-looking woman is also present. The obsequious Mr. Collins pulls up and clumsily climbs down from the carriage, causing Jane to stifle a giggle, and he bows to them reverentially. Now, a lavish dinner takes place, and Lizzie gives her father a look before she giggles. Mr. Collins gives Jane an ingratiating smile. Now the family is outside amusing themselves in the gardens as Mr. Collins is walking with Mrs. Bennet and looks at the girls carefully. Lydia and Kitty are playing a game with hoops, Mary is studying a book, and finally Lizzie is laughing and smiling with Jane. Mr. Collins bustles over to her, and she looks uncertain. Now the sisters are walking over a stone bridge, accompanied by Mr. Collins, who is exhausted from the walk. They make their way into the village, with carriages rolling past and people talking on corners. Lydia and Kitty rush ahead and stop at a shop window as Denny crosses to meet them with his companion. Bingley and Darcy ride by, with Darcy dismounting from his gray horse to join them. Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy spot each other, and a look passes between them before Mr. Wickham lifts his hat to him. Lizzie watches the exchange with interest and studies Darcy as he rides away sitting stiff and proper in the saddle. Lizzie and Kitty race in followed by Mary, and he backs away from them and takes a seat at a card table. Lizzie looks grateful for his departure as Mary starts playing the piano. At the whist table, Mr. Collins lays down a card, much to Mrs. Phillips's disgust.",
    "879": "Kate looks quizzically at Leah, who smiles and gestures towards Nick. He turns around and nods with a smile. Zoe frowns at Nick. Leah, wearing a thick winter coat, slings her bag over her shoulder as she leaves the staff changing room. Kate walks into her office, where Zoe is slumped over the desk fast asleep. Kate places a scarf around her neck, and looks down at her drawing of a sailboat and a dolphin that Zoe's resting on. Kate carries Zoe through the kitchen, and as she reaches the door, she turns back to Nick with a warm smile. He looks back at her kindly and watches them go. In Zoe's dark bedroom, Kate lays her sleeping niece down gently onto the bed. She undoes the laces on Zoe's red and white baseball boots and removes them. She places one of Zoe's stuffed toys down beside her, and Zoe immediately cuddles up to it. The next morning, Kate reaches out to turn off her square-faced alarm clock, which reads half-past four. She turns onto her back and opens her eyes sleepily. Kate pulls on a dark Berber-style jacket as she walks through to the lounge to pick up her mobile and heads towards the front door. Kate peers back up the hallway at Zoe, who's standing in her bedroom doorway clutching her cuddly Kangaroo. At the fish market, a bored-looking Zoe stands nearby, still clutching her cuddly toy, and yawns sleepily. Back at home, Kate and Zoe are asleep on the sofa. Kate stares and checks her watch, then hurries off. Later, they run along the pavement to the school, and Kate watches Zoe as she climbs the front steps, opens the heavy front door, and goes inside. At the restaurant, Kate and Leah are with a mustachioed man. Leah sniffs it, and he reaches into a bag, conducting Leah as she breathes deeply. Kate walks into her apartment with a smile, her long, dark hair hanging loose in large, soft waves. She hangs her bag on a hook by the door, drops her keys into the bowl, and begins to remove her coat, but her smile suddenly disappears. She grabs her keys and her bag and scurries out again. In a taxi, Kate jumps out and hurries towards the school, where Zoe's sitting on the steps. Zoe ignores her, stands up, and strides peevishly towards the yellow cab. Kate follows her and gets in beside her, pulling the door shut. At home, Zoe stomps straight into her bedroom, and Kate walks into hers. Kate's bedroom door opens, and she slowly steps out into the hallway, crosses to Zoe's room, and hesitates for a moment before knocking on the door.",
    "694": "Harry turns back to the stove and pours his egg, after which Mary Jane sprinkles on the cheese, and Harry adds some rocket. He flicks the omelette in half and tries to toss it in the pan, but half of it falls to the floor. Later, they read the script, and Mary Jane brushes Harry's dark hair back from his brow, meeting his adoring eyes. She pulls him towards her, and they kiss, but Mary Jane breaks off with a guilty look. Harry watches helplessly as she hurries down the black and white marble floored hallway into the lift. He storms into the study, grabs at the canter, and takes his wig, as his father's portrait glowers down at him. Harry gates, turns towards a tall mirror, and stares at his reflection, moving slowly towards it with an outstretched hand. As his fingers touch the glass, in a flashback, he sees Spider-Man standing over Norman's body and remembers pulling the Spider-Man mask off Peter's face. He remembers falling and waking up in the hospital, and his father looks back at him from the mirror. At night, Mary Jane comes home and hits the light switch, but the lights don't come on. Harry, in his Goblin suit, grabs Mary Jane by the throat, hovering on his sky stick as he holds her against the wall. Ursula, the landlord's daughter, smiles awkwardly as he hurries into the hallway. Peter nervously takes up the receiver. A couple strolls by the boating lake in Central Park as Peter, wearing a blue jumper over a blue shirt and jeans and clutching a small posy of flowers, stops in his tracks upon spotting Mary Jane standing alone in the middle of a graceful cast iron bridge. He hurries on to meet her and offers up the flowers, but she looks at them unhappily and turns aside, putting her hand over her eyes. Peter fumbles in his pocket for Aunt May's ring and, looking as if he's been hit in the stomach, watches in numb shock as she hurries away off the bridge. A little further along the lake, Harry leans against a tree observing the scene. He turns with a cruel smile as Mary Jane comes past, arms folded, glaring at him, and Mary Jane turns away angrily and carries on. Harry lets his head drop against the tree trunk with a smile of satisfaction. Later, he meets Peter in a coffee shop, draws breath, and Peter looks Harry in the eye before shaking his head and looking away in a daze. Blinking in shock and disbelief, Peter gets up and leaves as a waitress comes over to Harry with a coffee jar and Harry grins. Peter, crossing the road, turns and looks back.",
    "82": "He fetches a liquor bottle from beneath the rocking chair; about to pour he does a take at Bess's photograph. It stands in a cabinet frame: a fine-looking young woman in archaic dress, with sharp, accusing black eyes. He turns the picture away and splashes liquor into his coffee. They drink. John looks cautious. Birdie's face falls; he takes another drink. John puts his cup down and gets up. He heads for the door. John runs up the bank, not looking back. He runs up the street close to Spoon's and stops dead. He is horrified by what he sees. Group shot through door-glass, from John's viewpoint Preacher, Willa, and Pearl surround a little table. Walt stands by, puffing his pipe. Icey in the background, stirs fudge at a little soda-fountain stove. Willa looks both moved and pleased. Pearl, shyly flirting with Preacher, all but hides in Willa's skirts. Preacher dandles Pearl's doll on his knee as he talks. All the grownups are avid for his words, which we don't hear through the glass. We shoot through the door; he quietly enters. They look casually to John and continue talking. Over this John enters the shot and stands at the fringe of the group, staring at Preacher's hands and at the doll. He hands the doll to Pearl. John's eyes follow the doll. Preacher holds up both hands to John. John looks back at his hands. John stands still. They are impressed in their different ways. Slight applause from the adults. Preacher takes Pearl, with her doll, onto his lap. He does a little take. His eyes twinkle palely. Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them. A tight silence. Icey pours fudge into a buttered pan. Few men in proportion to women and children. We center Preacher. The women watch him and admire him. He gives Willa the eye as we pan to center Willa, who looks wooed and self-conscious. Icey enters the shot and whispers and beckons Willa and, as the singing continues, they leave the group and start towards a shade tree in medium ground, which we pan to center. They walk; singers in background. Willa nods. Icey, looking ahead, is displeased. They sit on the bench, their backs to us, partly concealed by the tree trunk. They look around. Icey and Willa enter the shot, their backs to us. They sit on the bench, their back to us. The children recede towards the river in background. Willa meekly keeps her head down. Singing continues o.s. Icey pivots and we pan over her to children by river. John looks up from pebble-skimming and loosens his tie. His brow is furrowed. He skims another pebble.",
    "703": "Harry falls to the floor of the building Mary Jane is on. Mary Jane runs to him. Peter desperately tugs at the black threads holding his wrists. He frees one hand and grabs a sharp spear of metal as Venom leaps at him. Cutting himself free, he knocks Venom away. Peter grabs two of the pipes. Venom falls to his knees. Peter spears the two pipes into the floor, grabs two more, and does the same, building a circular fence around Venom. The monster reels and half-disintegrates from the noise. Brock's face appears from within the symbiotic suit. Peter shoots a thread, pulls him free, and holds him through the bars. Behind Peter, the black spiky Venom suit assumes a life of its own, growing and flailing about. Peter and Brock look on in amazement as it tries to break out of its cage. Peter strikes the bells to make them ring then grabs a pumpkin bomb. Brock leaps in after the bomb. Peter puts a hand to his face to shield it from the blast. When the spot clears, there's nothing left of Brock or the symbiote. Behind him Flint materializes, sand pouring from his arm. Mary Jane runs down to where Harry lies on his back. She nods. Up above, Peter drops the tube he was carrying, his expression numb. Peter turns to find Flint right behind him. Peter's eyes narrow fractionally. As Peter listens, Flint's eyes become distant as he thinks back. In black and white flashback, Uncle Ben sits in his car. Flint comes up with a gun and taps on the window. Uncle Ben squeezes Flint's shoulder. In flashback, the accomplice runs up to Flint from behind and knocks him on the shoulder as he makes for the car. The gun discharges. Uncle Ben's eyes close, and he falls to the ground. Flint looks on, eyes wide with horror. He kneels over the dying man as his partner drives away. Flint lowers his eyes for a moment then looks back up at Peter. Peter frowns as he struggles to understand. Then lowers his grief-stricken eyes and nods to himself. He looks back at Flint who meets his steadfast gaze. Flint goes over to the edge of the skyscraper and looks down at the emergency vehicles far below. A pale, dawn light is spreading across the sky above them. He looks at the silver locket he holds in his hand, with its tiny photograph of his daughter, and turns back to Peter. His eyes brimming, Flint looks sorrowfully but steadily at Peter, who nods with a look of understanding. The ghost of a smile flickers across Peter's face. Flint nods faintly and starts to disintegrate into a whirling eddy of sand.",

Inside at the benefit, Emily and Andy follow Miranda around as she greets guests, prompting her as to who they are, while Miranda is wearing a black, off-the-shoulder gown. Andy spots Chairman Irv Ravitz with a chic lady on his arm. A tissue. A man waves at Miranda and turns to Emily, prompting Andy to step back. Emily looks gratefully at Andy, who smiles. Later, Andy is hurrying out of the benefit when she meets Christian coming up the steps, and Christian heads into the benefit. Andy is driven home through the busy New York streets and finds Nate watching TV alone. Andy shuts the door, puts down her bags, and walks over to him, carrying a single fairy cake with a lit candle on it. Dark-haired Nate looks morose as he sits forward and stops in the doorway, turns back to look at her, shaking his head sadly. Hanging his head, he turns and mooches off into the bedroom. Looking glum, Andy blows out the candle on the cake. Andy lets herself into Miranda's townhouse, carrying Miranda's dry cleaning and the book. She's wearing a cool monochrome outfit with black trousers, pale boots, and a big, floppy cap on her head. She puts the dry cleaning into the correct closet and is about to leave the book when she's summoned from one of the other rooms but cannot see Miranda. She yanks her cap off and smooths her fringe before heading in, where Miranda is in a chair in the lounge. Andy hands it to her. Miranda rises sternly, and Andy looks down. Miranda has turned her attention to the book as Andy stands and stares at her with her big doe eyes for a moment, then leaves. Andy strolls sadly through the city, mulling over her decision. It’s dark, and the swanky shop windows she passes are all lit up. She passes people sitting at tables outside a restaurant, shakes her head, and moves on. Yellow taxicabs pass her on the street as she walks past shop windows, one displaying a fashionable red coat. Back at home, Nate wanders out of the bedroom and finds Andy looking through some of her old articles and photographs, including one of her with her parents, and she picks up another photograph. Nate's shoulders sag, and he heads back into the bedroom and turns out the light as Andy rubs her neck, trying to ease some of the tension. Andy is at work early, and both Miranda's office and Emily's chair are empty. Andy stares across the anteroom at it, then picks up a clipboard and some papers. Miranda comes in, unbuttoning her coat, which has a striped collar.",
    "769": "The sequence begins with a scene where a figure scans around, followed by the Chancellor overlooking the loading bay. Yuri leads a fast-moving crowd across the wide boarding platform. As Tenzen and the others board the ship, Grandpa slips, prompting Jackson to quickly react and grab his arm. Tenzen acknowledges Jackson with a nod. The crowd on the boarding platform reaches a deep pit surrounding the ark, and when a man falls into the pit, the crowd halts in their tracks. The scene shifts to the ark bridge where the enormous rear life supports outside move into position. Jackson and the others are seen walking toward the hedge. A view from a height reveals the struggling crowd and the boarding platform below, where Yuri is heard saying something. From atop the hull, Tamara spots Caesar on the ground. Inside the hatch, Jackson holds a torch as Tenzen unwinds a sealed shaft. Caesar reaches Tamara just as the outer hatch closes, while Yuri looks on angrily, and Tamara gestures rudely at him before the hatch slams shut. Inside, Jackson, Gordon, and others shine torches as Tenzen uses a pneumatic drill. Nema looks up with hope as Tenzen opens a round hatch. On the control bridge, Adriane and Laura watch in horror as people outside fall off the boarding platform into the pit. Adriane crosses the bridge with a deep frown as Macarenka surveys a screen on his ark. Anheuser shakes his head at Adriane, who looks down with relief, while Anheuser hangs his head. Michaels picks up the phone on the control desk in a darkened corridor. Tamara uses her torch to light up various caged animals. As the gates open, a hydraulic ceiling lowers, knocking Gordon and Tenzen off a ladder. Jackson struggles to help the injured Tenzen and Gordon, who cling on just above grinding gears, with Gordon being dragged between the wheels. Uri tries to pull himself back onto the boarding platform from a lower ledge. Tenzen gets stuck between the gears and the swiftly descending hydraulic ceiling, as Jackson finds himself trapped between a wire fence and the ceiling. Tenzen's drill becomes entangled in the gears, causing sparks to fly. Jackson reaches out desperately as the hydraulic wall advances toward the gate, but the gears grind to a halt, and the wall stops. In the following chaos, hundreds of people leap onto the gate and board the Ark. Anheuser watches the chaos with anxiety and takes in his surroundings using a digital camera. Meanwhile, in a mountaintop monastery, flower petals are blown by the wind from a bowl as a Lama looks up from his seat on the floor, scanning around. In the distance, a gigantic wall of water crashes between the peaks of the snow-covered mountains, and Lama rings the monastery bell as the water rapidly approaches.",
    "192": "He drops the phone with a crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders, and shakes her. Mary begins to cry. He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace. Two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy. Mrs. Hatch is at the top of the stairs. She practically faints at what she sees. Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries. The camera pulls back, and we hear the sound of the Wedding March. People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining. Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the maid. George and Mary are in each other's arms. Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings. The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people around the door. He stops the cab. Scurrying people under umbrellas are swarming around the bank doors. Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close down. Several people come running past the cab. George gets out of the cab and looks down the street. George runs off up the street toward the Building and Loan. They are simply-dressed people, to whom their savings are a matter of life and death. George comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. The people look at him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear. An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and Loan. A crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill. It has been locked. He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open. Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the Building and Loan. George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in. Uncle Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking a drink from a bottle. He motions to George to join him. George turns back cheerfully to the crowd. George vaults over the counter. The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the teller's window. They all have their passbooks out. George hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for him. He points to George's office. The telephone rings.",

Still holding Scabbers, Ron is dragged under the roots, and Harry makes a grab for him, but a branch knocks Harry and Hermione over. The Whomping Willow waves its branches menacingly, and as they cautiously move towards it, the tree attacks them. A branch lashes down, causing Harry to lose his glasses. Hermione jumps over a swinging branch, but the next one lifts her off the ground, while Harry rolls over as the tree lashes out. He sprints off into flailing branches as Hermione is whirled above his head. Scratched by the sharp twigs, Hermione is twisted this way and that as she clings to the branch, being turned upside down. Harry finds his glasses and puts them on to see Hermione flying towards him. Desperately, she grabs hold of his T-shirt, and he is hauled into the air. They hurtle around until Hermione lets go, and Harry falls down the hole under the tree roots, with Hermione landing on top of him. Ahead of them is a flight of steps cut into the twisted roots, and they start to climb. Harry and Hermione climb up through a trapdoor under bare floorboards, where a faint light filters through wooden shutters. They go up a rickety staircase and along a dingy landing to a dilapidated room. Huge paw prints on the dusty floor lead across the room to a wild-eyed man with matted hair and a ragged convict's uniform. Hermione stands in front of Harry, but Harry pushes Hermione aside, knocks the man down, and threatens him with his wand, which flies out of his hand. Professor Lupin helps Sirius to his feet, and the children stare, horrified, as Sirius embraces him. Lupin narrows his eyes, looks from Sirius to Harry, and then gives Sirius his wand. Snape enters, and Harry slides Hermione's wand from her pocket, causing Snape to fly backwards. Sirius grabs the rat, which runs across the piano and scurries towards a rat hole, but Lupin and Sirius wave their wands, dragging out a pudgy little man with sharp, pointed teeth. He rubs his beady little eyes, and one finger on his left hand is missing. He tries to run, but they stop him. Pettigrew grabs Harry but is pulled away and sinks to his knees. Harry and Sirius help Ron out from the hole under the tree, and Hermione sits beside him. Sirius gazes towards the distant lights of Hogwarts, with Harry watching him anxiously. Lupin appears with Pettigrew and pulls him away. Hermione points to the sky as a full moon appears from behind the clouds, and they all stare at Professor Lupin. As the moonlight touches his face, his eyes turn green and his face distorts.",
    "502": "She picks up the check and looks at it. Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot, and he is trying to kiss her now. He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away. Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder. Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck. He has her ass in his hands and is beginning to hump her. She is pushing him away as hard as she can, but he is relentless. He looks mean and dangerous. He lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her, holding both of her arms with one hand. With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up. Thelma is still struggling, and there are tears running down her face. A tight shot shows the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into the nape of Harlan's neck, as Louise's thumb pulls back the hammer. Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts out, pulling her dress down. Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face, while his pants are undone in the front. She is still backing away with the gun raised, and Thelma is inching away as well. Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second before turning and walking away. Thelma does, too. Louise stops in her tracks, takes two long strides back towards him, raises the gun, and fires a bullet into his face. The car behind him is splattered with blood. Thelma and Louise are both silent. Louise lowers the gun, and Thelma runs to get the car, coming careening up in reverse. Louise hops in, and Thelma peels out, spraying gravel. As they speed out of the parking lot back to the road, music is blaring from the nightclub. They hit the main road with tires squealing, and Thelma starts to cry quietly. Thelma pulls off to the side of the road. Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car, stopping when she gets to the back of the car and is sick. Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side. Louise gets in the driver's side, and Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly. Louise studies Thelma's face and looks at her for a long time. Police cars are parked around, and the activity has died down. In the back of a police car sits the waitress with the door open, while a detective in a suit leans over the car door with his note pad. Louise did not realize she was doing it.",
    "799": "Rows of old film studio buildings are reflected in a shiny, gold surface, followed by a shaky animation of a figure wearing a long coat and a hat. The figure runs towards light, and its arms spread out, becoming wings as it takes flight and, as a bird, comes to rest. Al-Saleem, a bearded man wearing a loose-fitting robe and a pale cream cap, appears in a house where three young Middle Eastern men listen to him on a television. Meanwhile, on a cordoned-off street, a policeman pats the roof of a milk float that then drives off. Armed special branch officers in black run across wasteland as more officers huddle on a street corner while the milk float drives around. Officers make their way upstairs at the back of a boarded-up house and train their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. The Sikh milkman stops to pick up some pints of milk, and a marksman on the roof takes aim. Daylight floods through windows into the gloomy house as the milkman walks up to the front door, placing two pints of milk on the doorstep. One of the armed officers opens the back door and enters, alerting the three men inside. Bomb-making equipment is spread out on a table, and one of the men presses a key on a mobile phone, triggering a golden fireball that rips through the building. Police and civilians dive for cover as debris rains down, thick gray smoke fills the air, and plumes of smoke rise. Letters emerge from brief flashes of grainy surveillance footage of densely packed buildings bisected by streets. A casually dressed young man with a beard, Ferris, lies on a bed, deep in troubled thought with a pinched brow as he recalls sitting in a room watching a prisoner gagged and beaten to death with a cricket bat. In a large house, a craggy-faced man in his 40s, Edward Hoffman, dictates into a laptop while on TV. Ferris cocks a pistol in a meeting room. A car is blown up, and a soldier is shot as Hoffman talks to officials. Ferris, wearing jeans, a shirt, a casual top, and a baseball cap, sits at an Iraqi street cafe sipping coffee when a four-by-four pulls up. The driver, Bassam, with long black hair in a ponytail, yells to Ferris, who picks up his bag and coffee and gets in the four-by-four. Ferris sips his coffee as Bassam drives to a checkpoint on a dirt road where they're watched. Ferris looks at a stone house through binoculars, with goats swarming around in front. Bassam calls on his mobile while they're watched on a screen in a CIA surveillance room.",
    "301": "Suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and starts to sob, as he is unaware that Lisa is standing behind him and is also watching this little drama. Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically. In the background, Lisa, having just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table, is returning to the kitchen. Both of them swing their eyes a little to the left. The kitchen-living room combination of the ballet dancer's apartment has now been made more presentable, with the ice box skillfully concealed by a large Chinese screen. Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty, and she takes it over to the window to fill it. She is the perfect hostess, animated and charming, with an added personal touch for each guest. Her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men: one wearing a black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite; a young, rather handsome, actor in a grey flannel suit; and a bright, pleasant young man who might possibly be from Wall Street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. She is behaving with a sophistication not apparent when first seen in the morning. Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress that shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward the three men to offer them a plate of hors d'oeuvres. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamplight softens the surroundings. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual glance toward the others, stands beside her as she makes the drink, and looks at his watch with impatience, making a side comment to her about the lateness of the time. The latter two are engaged in an animated conversation. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek as if telling him to be patient, but instead of pacifying him, it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her shoulder and plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes for a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips, but only long enough to attract the attention of the other two men. With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him and makes him rejoin the other two, giving him a significant look. He ponders her last remark, then changes his look in another direction. The camera moves in until Jeff is in semi-closeup, alone.",
    "1089": "Aron, sitting with his legs drawn up in front of him, slowly gets up to his feet, and throws the cloth bundle over his shoulder as dark green conifers stretch as far as the eye can see. A man strides through the undergrowth and comes across Asael lying asleep by a tree with Aron in his arms. The stone-faced man in his late thirties, in a cloth cap and a brown leather jacket over heavy wool trousers, picks up a stone and tosses it onto the ground. Asael wakes up, gets to his feet, and Tuvia grabs him roughly. The two brothers hug fiercely, and Tuvia beckons to their youngest brother, and all three stand locked in a hug. Zus appears carrying kindling, and Tuvia nods bitterly as Zus fishes in his pocket, brings out the mezuzah, and tosses it to Tuvia, then drops the kindling to the ground. As Zus starts snapping the twigs, Tuvia glances at the Hebrew markings on the mezuzah and hugs Aron even more tightly. Zus hands Tuvia some vodka, and the four of them huddle together in the pouring rain, with Aron sitting with a coat on his head listening quietly. They have a little fire near to a stream. Tuvia crouches down next to Zus, who is the tallest of the three adults, while elsewhere in the forest, ants scurry over a mound of twigs. Aron pushes a stick into the mud with a curious expression and watches several ants climb onto it, brings the stick closer to him, and studies their movements. He reels around and spots a female figure running through the trees some distance away, gets to his feet, and starts to run after her. He stops between two silver birch trees and watches the teen girl run towards a gray-bearded man in a Homburg hat, shirt and waistcoat, and suit trousers sitting on a log with a little girl in his arms. Aron looks in another direction and sees a young man accompanying an old woman. From behind more trees, a man in a black hat and black overcoat with a smartly dressed woman are standing. Clutching his stick, Aron steps towards a mud ditch in the middle of a clearing, where the long winding ditch is full of dead bodies piled on top of each other, and Aron's eyes fill with horror. His brothers are sitting around the fire, and Zus and Tuvia look at each other. Aron has brought the old man and the child, and Tuvia lays the child down near the fire. Zus, armed with a rifle, watches the other people arrive, and he and Tuvia glance at each other in mute surprise as the old man weeps and strokes the little girl's glossy dark hair.",
    "30": "He smiles as he turns toward Rick. Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at Renault. Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick. He walks to a table and sits. As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the letters. Strasser is on the phone. He hangs up the receiver and presses a buzzer on his desk. An officer quickly enters. He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap, hurriedly exits. The entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog. The outline of the transport plane is barely visible. On the airfield a transport plane is being readied. A uniformed orderly uses a telephone near the hangar door. He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside the hangar. Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention. He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket of his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun. Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car. Laszlo and take care of his luggage. The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane. Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar. Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both Ilsa and Renault look at Rick with astonishment. Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa. Renault countersigns the papers. Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her chin and raises her face to meet his own. Major Strasser drives at break-neck speed towards the airport. He honks his horn furiously. Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo. Rick hands the letters to Laszlo. Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly. On the airfield the airplane engine turns over and the propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off. Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa. Then Laszlo breaks the silence. Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards the plane. Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth. The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the field. Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar. Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault. Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway. Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the telephone just inside the hangar door. His eyes dart towards the telephone.",
    "438": "The camera goes slowly up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem of three balls, which stands outside the hock shop. The time is twenty minutes of one, but the clock says five minutes of four. Nat is at the bar with two or three customers listening to race results on a little radio. Don drags himself in, drenched in sweat, his breath as short and agonized as that of a dying man. He goes to the end of the bar closest to the door, hoists the typewriter on it with a final awful effort, and leans his head on it. A drink is shoved at Don, but he is shaking so much that he can't pick up the glass. He bends down, sucks half of it, then lifts the glass and drains the rest. Don holds out the empty glass to Nat, his eyes imploring, then takes the typewriter and drags himself out of Nat's place. Don emerges and starts dragging himself up the street towards home. As he passes the antique shop, he suddenly stops, noticing the wooden Indian Gloria spoke about, pointing up. Don walks into the house and goes to the second floor of this same crummy Third Avenue house -- dark woodwork, paint peeling from the walls. Beside the door at the head of the stairs, there are about three bells for the several occupants of the apartment within. Don drags himself up the stairs, puts down the typewriter, and inspects the name tags by the bells. He rings the bell beside it, then rings again. From inside, the door is opened by Gloria, wearing a dressing gown and bedroom slippers, her hair in the ruined elaborate hairdress of yesterday, her eyes blazing with anger. She slips into the apartment, leaving the door about three inches ajar. After a couple of seconds, Gloria reappears with a wallet, while Don leans against the door jamb, breathing heavily. She takes five dollars out and gives it to him. Don takes it with a shaking hand, and she brushes his forehead with the back of her hand. He takes her hand and kisses it, and Gloria looks at him, then at her hand. He bends, picks up the typewriter, and starts downstairs, with Gloria looking after him. A man looks at Don but doesn't answer, instead staring at him, terrified, before drifting away eerily. From the opposite direction, a male nurse comes, getting a pad and pencil from his pocket. Don has risen, wearing flannel pajamas like all the rest of the patients. Bim stands quietly watching him with a great big grin on his face. However, Don manages to make the swinging glass door past the benches and a collection of wheelchairs along the walls.",
    "630": "She walks over to the torch, picks it up, and shines it at Merrill, who's stacking crates and live sacks of dog food in front of the chute. He slides wearily down his barricade to the ground. Spotting a can of dog food on the floor, he picks it up and, rising slightly, reaches up beside him to slap it on top of the pile of sacks. Sitting back down on the floor, he looks across at Bo, and then picks up his torch, using it to search the basement for the others. The beam illuminates his brother, sitting on the floor, leaning against a pillar. Morgan is sitting between Graham's legs, his head pushed back into his father's chest. Merrill's eyes widened in alarm. Graham has one hand on Morgan's chest, the other gripping his son's shoulder. Bo stares at them wide-eyed. Graham rests his head against Morgan's. Bo goes to sit on Merrill's lap, tears welling in her eyes. Morgan holds the knees of his father's jeans tightly as he struggles with his breathing. Graham lifts his head slightly and stares angrily into the distance. His lips quiver. Merrill wheels Morgan on, mouthing silent words of earnest prayer. Morgan relaxes his grip on his father's jeans. Morgan lies back, his breathing returning to normal. Merrill stares across at them, blinking rapidly. He swallows. He turns his off. Bo turns hers off. In Graham's mind, he reaches the scene of the accident. Caroline talks to him. He stares at the ground, his lips trembling. Caroline nods. She smiles bleakly. Graham walks slowly past a police car and a huddle of policemen standing over Ray who's sitting on the ground, head bowed. A little way beyond is Ray's Ford pickup truck smashed into the tree, stretched into any of the front and a couple of paramedics standing by. They turn to look at Graham as he approaches. Back in the basement, the main light is on. Graham looks up. Merrill walks over to the radio. Graham stares blearily down at the floor. Graham looks up at Merrill in shock. Graham gets to his feet and takes a step towards his brother. Graham looks reflectively down at the ground. Merrill regards him accusingly. Graham frowns and shakes his head. Merrill steps towards him. Graham nods numbly, his mouth agape. They turn to look at Morgan asleep on the floor, his head resting on folded blankets. Graham glances at the door. Suddenly, thinking of something, Graham walks over to Morgan, and crouching down, lifts up the back of the boy's beige and brown check shirt. Graham glances up in relieved surprise and pulls the baby monitor out of the back pocket of Morgan's jeans.",
    "1386": "Hermione reads over the shoulders of others, while a flicker of fear passes through Harry's face as Bem, a Nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of Black. Beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then slowly begin to wither. The dew freezes, the grass grows brittle, and seconds later, the Dementors sweep by. A tall wardrobe rattles violently as Harry, Ron, and several classmates regard it warily. Ron jumps, glances at Hermione, then whispers to Harry. Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe and steps forward queasily as everyone laughs good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully and leans close to Neville, whispering. Neville's eyes pop open in shock as he considers Lupin uncertainly, then nods nervously and takes a deep breath. Sparks jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe bursts open. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs away in fright and turns, seeing Harry step forward expectantly. Concern flickers through Lupin's face as the Jack-In-The-Box pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry, becoming more sinister, transforming into a Dementor. Harry starts to raise his wand, then freezes, transfixed as the Dementor looms closer and closer. Lupin steps between them, snapping his wand, and studies Harry curiously. Harry looks up and finds Lupin studying him as Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks and smiles, turning to eye Harry affectionately. Harry smiles vaguely. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances when Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen. The students dash to the landing, where all the paintings whisper fearfully. Filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows, then narrow as he extends a crooked finger. High up, near the ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own, trembling. As the students react, Dumbledore's voice cuts through. The clock tower door's great groaning tumblers fall, spindles rotate, and cylinders fire into place. Windows: iron spikes, sharp as razors, rise instantly. One by one, deep in the distance, the lights of the Great Hall go out. Dementors appear, covering the frame, then separate like a curtain. The camera drifts through the silent room, over an ocean of sleeping bags, finding Harry lying awake, staring at the net of stars glimmering beyond the highest window. A gentle creak is heard and Harry's eyes shift to see Snape pass through the great doors and converge with Dumbledore. Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the bait, while Snape's eyes glitter darkly. Dumbledore gazes out over the slumbering students, and as his gaze finds Harry, Harry shuts his eyes and feigns sleep. As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy finishes scrawling something on a bit of parchment and balls it up in his hands, and as he opens them, a moth flutters from his palms.",
    "633": "A path leads from the side of the circle, splitting into two prongs. A third crop circle has two straight lines at either side, and a circle of maize remaining in the center, with another path leading off from its side. It splits into three larger prongs, the central one of which points towards a smaller circle. Graham is on the phone as he looks out of his window at the yard. He bows his head. Graham steps into the kitchen, where one of the dogs lies on the floor near a puddle of liquid. Morgan and Bo lead the Alsatian into the backyard. Graham crosses the kitchen and pulls some paper towels off a roll, dabbing at the urine and saturating the towels. Then, he stands and walks back across the kitchen. A dark-haired woman in a police uniform leans casually in a doorway leading to the front hall, as Carolyn sighs wearily and gazes at Graham. In the yard, Morgan's at the smoking barbecue, where he sticks a fork in a chicken wing and turns it over. One of the Alsatians watches Morgan from the veranda while the other one, Houdini, lies slumped in the yard with Bo kneeling in front of him. Morgan walks across to Bo as she drinks from a large glass of water, kneels beside his sister, drinks from the tall glass, and then gives her the glass. Bo carefully pours the water into a metal dog bowl and slides it across the grass to Houdini. The Alsatian suddenly jerks his head up towards Bo, causing her to jump back in shock and Morgan to frown. Bo stands as Houdini stands up, causing Bo to freeze. The stalks all lie in the same direction, and Graham shakes his head. Carolyn looks across the field as Graham stares thoughtfully into space, rises, and slowly walks towards the edge of the circle. Carolyn stands and watches him with a slightly puzzled expression. Graham gazes across the field and then he and Carolyn emerge through the tall green crop, looking around anxiously. Graham spots something over to his left, strides briskly towards it with a concerned expression, and Carolyn follows him as they break into a jog. Houdini lies motionless on the ground near the climbing frame, with Morgan kneeling beside him and a barbecue fork sticking out of Houdini's throat. Morgan holds an asthma inhaler as he stares down at the dog, then looks up at his father through puffy red eyes. Bo sits up on a platform on the climbing frame, with her knees drawn tightly up to her chin, wearing blue sneakers and jeans under her pale flowery dress. Morgan looks back down and takes a puff of his inhaler while Graham stares at his son and crouches down beside Houdini.",
    "848": "Dark clouds cover half of the bright moon as a figure hurtles dying towards the ground. Long, bony fingers caress the street as the black-tied figure rises to its feet, revealing a slight man in his 30s with blood streaking the right side of his face, blond cropped hair, and a thick collar. He stares at lights in the sky which go out as rain falls. He throws himself against the wall and huddles beside it, holding out a broad-bladed dagger and pointing it in the direction of a barking dog behind a wire fence. The man rips open his black top, revealing a thin, toned body with tattoos and blood aligned with the streak on his face. He walks towards the dog in its pound, raises the dagger above his head, and brings it down with great force. A bright light shines on him, and a blue light ring falls over him, opening the collar around his neck, which falls to the ground. Rain washes blood across the ground and into a drain. Inside a building, a man in a suit carrying a torch walks between stacking shelves, some covered with cellophane, steps on a toy under a skylight, and bends down to pick it up. The man in the black coat jumps through the skylight onto him, knocking him and his torch to the floor. The man from the sky goes to a grubby men's room, removes his coat, opens a first aid box, uses a thread and a bent needle to stitch a nasty wound on his back with flesh torn away at shoulder level, watches his reflection in a mirror as he sews, and grasps the sink with his bloody hand as his blood drips on the floor. Now dressed, he marches to a door, removes a chain, switches on lights in an armory, and is dressed in black shirt, trousers, and light coat. He picks up two assault rifles with grenade launchers, a selection of assault and sniper rifles, and walks out of the armory with two bags in his hands. He reaches a door with a metal bar across it as two cops, Burton and Estevez, drive along a downtown street. The burlier of the two, Burton, glances out as they pass people on the sidewalk and holds up his fingers in the shape of a gun. A door explodes just in front of them, and a man is hurled into the air, creating a hole in the shape of a cross in the building. They watch as the man from the sky steps into the flaming surround, and Burton gets out and draws his gun.",
    "1242": "He jabs his finger while Peter stands by, frowning, as they watch Longson march off. On a dark, rain-sodden pitch, Bremner, in a yellow Leeds shirt, slides down a Derby player while Leeds players foul and head-butt their counterparts, and Brian bellows at Don. Bremner strolls up to Brian and shakes his hand on the touchline before smirking. Brian and Peter are dazed in the rain as the Leeds players trudge off, gesticulating at the Derby crowd. Longson stalks angrily down the corridor, past the away dressing room, to stand beside a hangdog Brian surveying his battered team, glaring at Brian before turning on his heel, leaving a rueful Brian to meet Peter's concerned look. Brian addresses the press assembled in the tunnel of Juve's Comunale Stadium and jabs his finger at a camera. Nurses wheel a gurney from an ambulance as Brian sits by Peter's hospital bedside, smiling and looking away. Their eyes meet and hold a loaded look for a moment before each drops his gaze. Brian storms into the Derby board meeting where Longson stares at the table as he smokes a cigar, while the other directors look away from Brian's plaintive looks. Shaking his head in disbelief, Brian wanders down to Longson, then hurls his tracksuit top on the table. Everyone gathered in the candlelit room turns to look at Peter as Brian crosses the room to him. Brian stands beside three grinning young men before the assembled press below the Leeds United sign in front of the stadium as Giles, Bremner, and Hunter watch from the training ground. Brian passes them in the tunnel, standing with his back to the pitch in the players' tunnel, smiling bitterly as Giles points past him towards the empty stadium at the end of the tunnel. Brian's smile wilts as Giles turns and saunters off with the other players, who pat him on the back as they go. Alone, Brian turns slowly and makes his way up towards the pitch, gazing at the empty stands. Alone in his stark hotel room, Brian lies on his bed, smoking and drinking, staring at the little girl playing noughts and crosses with the toy clown on the television test-card. A woman rides a tricycle past beach huts on the seafront promenade, girls flock across the beach by the pier, an elderly couple eat fish and chips, and more middle-aged folks snooze in deck chairs in the hazy sunshine. Brian pulls up with Peter in his Ford Zodiac on the seafront, and they stroll along passing a woman hobbling with a Zimmer frame as Brian's eyes drift away and he frowns. Peter points over the street to a hotel, and in the bar, the Brighton Chairman extends his hand to shake.",
    "910": "Taking a deep breath, she manages a brave nod, blinking back tears as she opens the door and hurries out, while Clark Gable stares after her and Dillinger watches with shining eyes. Outside, Purvis checks his watch, posted near the box office, looking across the street at Winstead and Hurt waiting patiently in the recessed storefront. Purvis turns, gazing toward the cinema lobby, where on the movie screen, Clark Gable faces William Powell with a cocky smile, as Dillinger watches with a defiant smirk. Gable turns away from Powell, who draws a deep breath and heads into a cellblock, followed by a guard who closes a prison door and locks it. Outside the theater, Purvis digs a box of matches from his pocket and takes one out, producing a cigar from his breast pocket and holding it ready. On the movie screen, Gable makes his way down the cellblock, flanked by guards, while Dillinger wears a faint, sad smile as Gable faces a fellow convict, maintaining a faint half-smile with shining eyes. Outside, Purvis shifts his tense, vigilant gaze, and in the movie house, words appear on the screen as patrons stand, filing out of their rows. Anna tensely gets to her feet and looks around, and a few rows down, Dillinger stands with Polly and dons his straw hat, while outside, Purvis watches the exiting patrons. At the storefront, Winstead and Hurt stand ready as in the parked car, the burly agent sweats at the wheel, his right hand trembling severely, using his left to steady it. Near the cinema door, Purvis watches movie patrons exiting the lobby, facing the street, striking the match, and lighting his cigar. With a hostile sneer, the burly agent rushes out of the car as Dillinger steps into plain view, walking between Anna and Polly, the crime boss smiling thoughtfully, his younger friend wearing a carefree grin, while Anna keeps her pace with a dour expression. Shoving a bystander aside, Purvis heads down the sidewalk after them, as the burly agent joins the flow of foot traffic with his gun raised, and Martin Zarkovich notices and roughly pushes two bystanders out of his way. Purvis moves with a deliberate stride and steady gaze, while across the street, Winstead and Hurt leave the recessed storefront. Meanwhile, the burly agent scowls, holding his aim as he gains on the crime boss, a few yards ahead, where Dillinger frowns, maintaining his wide swagger. Our view hovers at the back of Dillinger's head, then we see him frown as he looks over his shoulder and halts. As he and the burly agent lock gazes, the G-man's breathing grows shallow and he lowers his gun on Dillinger, who reaches into his pocket, as Purvis tries to push between a couple and Winstead shoves between another pair, brushing a man aside.",
    "624": "A set of swings and a climbing frame stand in a rural backyard, along with a picnic table and a brick barbecue, overlooked by an upstairs window. Inside, a framed photo on a bedside table shows a smiling family: mum, dad, a young boy, and a girl. The dad wears a clerical collar. Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed, his eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room. He relaxes and sits up. The man, Graham Hess, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He walks along the landing in his bare feet and comes to a closed door with some hand-drawn children's pictures stuck to it. Graham pauses for a moment to listen at the door, then returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face. Graham crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth. He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room, and glances around. A younger man in a similar rural-style bedroom suddenly jolts and tumbles out of bed. He jumps to his feet and strains to listen. Graham rushes out of his wooden farmhouse and heads towards a whitewashed barn, while the younger man runs down a flight of steps from the other floor. Graham and the young man, Merrill, charge through a field of tall green maize. They stop when they reach a gap and look along a clear pathway, which cuts through the crop. A dark-haired girl of about six-years-old stands a little further down the path. The two men run over to her, and Graham grabs her by the arms. Merrill picks up Bo, and Graham dashes on through the maize. He reaches a fair-haired boy of about 10, who stares glassily across the field. Graham turns Morgan's head to face him. Morgan puts his hand around his father's jaw and turns his head to face in the direction he had been staring. Graham stands and slowly walks through the maize, followed by Merrill, who's still carrying Bo in his arms. Graham stops and glances around anxiously. He swallows hard and tentatively steps forward onto a sea of flattened maize stalks. Graham stares in wonder as he, Merrill, Morgan, and Bo come to the perimeter of a vast circular expanse of flattened maize. Two large Alsatians pace around uneasily in the center. An aerial view shows Graham and his family standing in the circle, which is about 100 yards in diameter. Another crop circle lies beside it, the same size but with a small semi-circle of maize still standing within it.",
    "531": "The mirror shatters. Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror. Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door. He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room. Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene. The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story. Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater. The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk. The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater. As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration. The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience. As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing. The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park. They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time. They stroll offscreen. Mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand. Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove. As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty glasses. Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin. Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting. The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.",
    "1208": "Climbing the wooden ladder leading to it, he cuts the rope securing a door and pulls it open. Michael is nearest the door. Rambo removes the blindfold. Rambo leaves, passing the footless corpse of the crucified man. At the dance show, one of the soldiers pulls on a cigarette, stands, and throws the butt at the dancing girls. A woman raises an arm to protect herself. The soldier raises his arms in triumph. Another soldier throws liquid at them. The women cower. Diaz creeps between two huts and is surprised by Rambo, who's waiting there. Rambo beckons to him. At the dance, a soldier with a can of booze climbs onto the stage with a grin on his face. He slaps one of the girls on the rump. She lurches forward. The soldiers jump and wave their arms ecstatically. Lewis runs past a hut with his weapon primed. Two guards in ponchos walk over the wooden bridge. Rambo takes cover in the timbers beneath it. The soldier on stage continues to humiliate a terrified dancing woman by pouring his can of drink over her head. Rambo wades up the stream. A soldier emerges from a hut onto a veranda. He angles a lamp above his head to illuminate them. He carries a spirit-type bottle of golden-brown booze in his hand. He swigs from the bottle and goes inside. He emerges once more. He plants his hands on his head and heads away across the sodden compound. BN sneaks up to the cage, breaks open a chain on the door, and motions the women to follow him quietly. Rambo continues upstream. It rises to meet the ground of the camp and is bordered by bushes. Yards from its end, Rambo spots a Burmese soldier pushing a young boy in front of him. Rambo ducks out of sight as they go by. The dance event descends into chaos. The soldier on stage slams one of the women to the stage floor. He picks her up and throws her over the arms of his fellows below. They begin to tear at her clothes. One trooper fights the others off and leads the girl away, keeping his comrades at arms' length. The boy is pushed into another hut, where the commander is sitting. The door of the hut remains open. The commander walks up to the boy and inspects him. The commander wears a tunic decorated with ribbons. It is open, and he wears a white vest and dog tags underneath. The commander strokes the boy's head. Rambo looks away in disgust. The door closes. Rambo emerges from hiding. He checks his watch, three minutes to two. Diaz hops over a timber fence and runs up the ladders to the volunteers' cage.",
    "444": "Don freezes, his eyes turning towards the door, horrified. He rises slowly from the couch and takes a few steps towards the entrance door, where Mrs. Foley, a middle-aged charwoman with a large utility bag over her arm, stands. He stands galvanized before going to the kitchenette, where he lifts the lid of the sugar bowl on the counter under the cupboards. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill, which Don takes out. He goes into the entrance hall and, even though Mrs. Foley can't see him, instinctively holds the five dollars behind his back. She closes the door, takes the key, and starts down the stairs. Don looks at the five-dollar bill, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, and, with an afterthought, goes into the living room. The camera moves slowly toward a rack of liquor bottles, showing the shop, its window on Third Avenue, and its entrance door. From behind the rack, through the glass door, Don Birnam is seen hurrying up to the shop. He peers inside to make sure there are no other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands breathing heavily. He gives a quick glance in each direction to ensure he's not observed. A salesman, with his back to the camera, rises in the foreground as Don points to two bottles. The salesman takes two bottles from the rack and puts them on the counter. Don gives him the money and picks up the bottles like a miser grabbing gold. The salesman hands him a bag and steps out of the shot towards the cash register. Meanwhile, Don thrusts the bottles in the bag. The salesman hands him his change. It is a little short, and the necks of the bottles protrude, which Don pockets. Don takes the package and walks past a newcomer towards the door, hiding it gracefully like a football in a sneak play. Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag and stops in front of a fruit stand. Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back, he picks up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag to camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin, then walks down the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is obviously full of apples. The lady with the dog sees him, and although he wants to start down the street, about twenty-five feet away stand two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog on a leash.",
    "427": "Eddie takes his cue ball from the cashier's cage and heads for a table, and as he passes Charlie, he mimics the cashier wickedly. The two go to a table where Eddie selects a house cue, then rolls it over the table top to test the roll and seems pleased. He runs his hand over the green felt as if he were caressing it, and his last test is to sweep the cue ball into the corner pocket. Eddie takes some balls out of the return box and throws them on the table, but Big John and Preacher lean forward in their chairs to listen in. Big John, with a stubbly cigar between his fingers, drifts over to their table, and as he walks off, Eddie smiles at Charlie, saying, \"Eight sharp.\" A departing customer holds the door for an incoming one: Minnesota Fats. Heads turn when he makes his punctual appearance, and Fats' clothes reflect his high station at Ames Pool Hall: a gray felt bowler hat, and an expensive, tailored overcoat, with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs peeking up from its breast pocket. He moves like a sultan through the room, past Big John whose eyes dip significantly, and over to the coat rack where Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat. The buzzard-like eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie's table as Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case, then casually strolls toward Eddie's table standing apart and quietly observing the sharp, precise movements of his prospective opponent. Even though Ames is filled with players, there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls. Fats and Eddie regard each other with amusement, sharing the private joke of pool hustlers, and at his command, Ames comes to life. Players drag their chairs across the floor and position them around the main table. Eddie, hand to his mouth, realizes that the big moment has arrived and beckons to Charlie for his leather cue case. The uniformed maids withdraw the cover off the green felt top, and Sausage, the racker, begins to bang the balls into the wooden racking triangle. Fats is in the washroom, scrubbing his hands and nails, while Eddie stands and screws together his inlaid, ivory-pointed cue as Fats dries his hands. He and Fats eye one another, and Henry helps Fats on with his coat. Fats carefully extends his palms so that Henry may sprinkle on some talcum powder. Sausage finishes racking, and they are ready to start. Fats, immaculate in jacket and tie, tosses a wad of bills -- his stake money -- onto the table, and Charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one as Willie takes the money. Two balls are rolled to the end of the table, and Fats and Eddie, like two duelers, prepare to shoot for the break.",
    "991": "They sip their vodkas, and Elizabeth takes another spoonful of caviar. They each take another swig of vodka. A reporter interviews her on the beach, and Benjamin takes her hand, and she responds. He stares at her through his round spectacles, and she looks up at him and touches his face. She smiles, and they lean together and share a kiss. She gets up from the table and walks away. Wearing a suit, Benjamin takes the lift down to the hotel lobby. Outside, they open champagne and walk through the deserted, snowy streets, arm in arm, the streetlights dimly illuminating their way, while Benjamin shivers. In the hotel, Benjamin takes a room key off a hook behind reception and gets in the lift with Elizabeth, closing the doors as the lift rises. Elizabeth wears a fur coat and a hat with a broad brim, which casts her face in shadow, as they gaze at each other. They arrive outside room 57, and he unlocks the door. He holds it open and turns to Elizabeth, who falls into his arms, and they disappear into the room. Caroline smiles and keeps reading. Returning from work, Benjamin gets in the lift at the hotel, where Elizabeth's po-faced husband is the only other occupant. Benjamin avoids his gaze as the lift rises. In the evening, he and Elizabeth go to room 57, where Elizabeth kisses him twice as they leave the room. She starts to walk away down the corridor, looks back, smiles, and goes. He comes downstairs and finds the lobby deserted, as well as the dining room and the kitchen. He looks over at the bar, then takes a seat by the fire in the lobby. As the night wears on, Benjamin drifts off to sleep. When he wakes, people are milling around the lobby. Looking awkward, Mr. Mayes heads out of the bar, past Benjamin, while Captain Mike swigs from a coffee cup. Benjamin unlocks his door and finds a note has been pushed under it. At night, on board the tugboat, Benjamin, who'd just thrown a bucket of water over the side of the ship, goes below decks and lies on his bed, reading a magazine. One of the other sailors, Pleasant, calls down from his top bunk and hands Benjamin a big roll of notes, before lying back out of Benjamin's sight. Up on deck, Benjamin and the other crew members walk towards the prow of the tug, passing Mike, who's ringing the alarm bell, as they look out into the night. Up ahead of them, they see several burning ships on the dark horizon, while Pleasant runs up to a searchlight mounted by the wheelhouse. Dead bodies drift in the dark waters, and in the wheelhouse, the wheelman kills the engines.",
    "1112": "The car flies high over the tops of the tall trees, zooms over the forest, and lands heavily on the grass beside Hagrid's cottage. They stagger out as the battered car starts itself, reverses, changes direction, and drives away past Hagrid's cottage, disappearing into the trees at the edge of the dark forest. The sun rises behind the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School. In the hospital wing, Harry puts some fresh flowers on the table by Hermione's bed, and he and Ron sit sadly beside their petrified friend. Harry gently strokes her hand and notices something clutched in her clenched fingers—a crumpled piece of paper, a page from a book. Harry looks puzzled for a moment, then spots his reflection in the window and reads from the page again. Harry and Ron hide in the second-floor corridor where the teachers are gathering. Lockhart swaggers up, swallows nervously, and hurries away. Harry and Ron look horrified as the worried teachers leave and Ron reads out the message written in blood on the wall. They run to Lockhart's room, where Lockhart is packing, grabbing his wand. The boys point their wands at him, and he drops his. In the girls' lavatory, Myrtle spots the three of them coming in, points across the room, and floats away. Harry crosses to the ring of sinks set around the base of an ornate marble structure, looks up, runs his hand along the ledge above, twists the tap, and notices a raised decoration on the side of it—a copper snake. Running his finger over it, Lockhart looks aghast. Staring at the tiny snake, Harry concentrates hard, opens his mouth, and speaks. They all step back as the heavy top of the structure rises into the air, the sinks around the base divide and move away from each other, and the sink decorated with the snake slowly disappears downwards. As it reaches the ground, a heavy metal grill slides over it, uncovering a deep shaft. Lockhart looks down into it, then backs away, but they grab him, and he almost falls down the shaft. He stares down it as Ron gives him a push and Lockhart disappears. They stare down after him as Harry jumps, quickly followed by Ron. The shaft becomes a smooth pipe, and they slide down it and fall onto a floor covered with animal bones. They point their wands at Lockhart, who is covered in dirt. Ron notices the bones on the ground and makes Lockhart follow Harry through a huge pipe. The pipe leads to a low cave where something scaly is lying on the ground, and Lockhart faints. Leaping up, Lockhart grabs Ron's wand.",
    "202": "George regards the two of them with manly disgust; they are like two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter and gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces. Violet gives him the money, jumps down off her stool, and exits, while Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes. George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish, pulls a magazine from his pocket, shows it to her, and leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her. Mary, whispering, leans over and speaks softly. She then draws back quickly, looking down, terrified at what she has said as he turns back to the cash register, whistling. He observes the entrance to the prescription room at the end of the fountain as Gower comes to the entrance, bleary-eyed, unshaven, and chewing an old unlit cigar, with a gruff and mean manner. Evidently, he has been drinking. George turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it and then sets it down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower; he gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower. Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box. George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor, with capsules spilling on the floor at their feet. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth, and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say, turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules, and stands still, horrified. His fingers fumble, and his eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George comes out into the main room, and with an inspiration, he dashes out the door and down the street, followed by Mary's eyes. He stops as Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly, he runs up the stairs to offices that are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. As George is about to enter his father's office, Uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.",
    "519": "She slams it closed, distracted. Gail sighs. She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as Mickey continues to speak. Mickey sighs. Pedestrians pass. The camera moves up the hotel's facade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up. Elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to Lee. Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. They stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall. They walk towards the camera, further into the room. Elliot puts his arm around Lee. The camera follows Lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the foot of the bed. She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window, turning when Elliot speaks. He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows. He takes Lee into his arms. They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room. Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking the kiss. They embrace. They kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter. The harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head. He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to Lee. He holds a cigarette. Elliot chuckles; they hold hands. Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately. Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded. A car drives by; a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella. Lee passes a restaurant well lit inside by hanging lamps. The baroque music continues as she enters the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door, touching her soaking hair. Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper. As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light. She takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry her hair with a towel. Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel down on the counter. She takes a kettle and fills it with water. As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard, walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills.",
    "1266": "He turns and checks behind him. He turns back and lifts up the golden snitch bequeathed to him by Dumbledore. The writing on it appears. Harry studies it. He lifts the golden snitch to his mouth and presses it to his lips. The outer casing opens. The inner casing revolves to create an opening. Inside, a polished octagonal stone. On one surface, a circle is inscribed inside a triangle, down the middle of which is a line. The stone floats out of the snitch. Harry places the palm of his right hand under the floating stone. He carefully clenches his fist around it. His eyes are closed. Harry slowly opens them and stares ahead. In front of him stand his parents, with Sirius and Remus. Lily stretches out her hand. Harry goes to take it, but his hand passes right through hers. They gaze at each other. Lily lowers her hand. Lily smiles. Harry turns to Sirius and takes a few paces forward. Harry nods at his father, James. Harry turns and gazes at his mother, then moves towards her. He looks across at his father. Sirius points at Harry's heart. Once again, Harry's gaze lights upon his mother. Harry unclenches his fist. The Resurrection Stone falls gently onto the forest floor. Voldemort stands in a clearing in the forest. Voldemort opens his eyes and glares at the gaunt-faced Death Eater. Bellatrix Lestrange walks up behind Voldemort, who takes a few paces forward. He turns around. Bellatrix lowers her head reverentially as he passes her, the Elder Wand clasped in his right hand. He stops and half turns his head. Bellatrix peers through the gloom and sees Harry coming into the clearing. Voldemort flexes his neck and looks back over his shoulder. He turns to face Harry. Hagrid sees him. Voldemort stares at the teenager who stands unwavering in front of him. Nagini slithers past Hagrid towards Voldemort, who steadies himself and raises his wand. Harry stands, unflinching. Harry closes his eyes. A stream of green light flashes from the Elder Wand and hits Harry full on. Bright white light. Harry comes to. He's clean-shaven, unbruised, and without his spectacles. He stands silhouetted against a completely white background. Behind him in the whiteness, there's a small bench. He walks over to it and bends down to peer underneath the bench. He recoils when he sees a tiny, skeletal, red, raw naked figure curled up in a fetal position. Dumbledore steps towards him. Dumbledore wears a silvery white robe in the vista of white. Harry looks around. He glances back at the fetal figure. They stroll along the platform and sit down on a bench. Dumbledore gets to his feet.",
    "358": "Merry sits up with a worried look on his face as Pippin unwraps the Palantír and gazes intently into it, horrifying Merry. As Pippin lays his hands on the crystal, a sickly pale light slowly spreads from the glass ball onto Pippin's face, and he suddenly starts to hyperventilate. The Great Eye of Sauron seems to leap from the fire, and Pippin is bathed in the fiery red light. Pippin sinks to his knees, his mouth open in a soundless scream, and falls backward, powerless to release the fiery. Gandalf wakes with a start just as Aragorn enters and wrenches the Palantír from Pippin's hands. Aragorn spins away, reeling backward, and the Palantír falls from his hands, rolling across the floor and causing everyone in the room to cower back. Gandalf throws a blanket over it, with angry disbelief on his face, and rounds on Pippin. Gandalf lifts the hobbit's slumped head. A lone white tree is silhouetted by flames. Gandalf stares at Pippin, frightened. Théoden stands in the Golden Hall, gravely listening to Gandalf, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli look on. Gimli lets out a sigh of relief. Gandalf turns to look at Théoden, who listens intently, saying nothing, as he knows Gandalf speaks the truth. Gandalf rounds on Théoden, who holds Gandalf's gaze, while Aragorn turns to look at Théoden. Gandalf turns on his heel and hurries along the streets, with Pippin and Merry running alongside trying to keep up. Pippin catches up to Merry, but Merry turns away, as it is too much for him. He turns on Pippin, and Pippin's face is shown as Merry strides away. Pippin is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of Shadowfax as Gandalf hurriedly prepares to leave. Merry thrusts a small package into Pippin's hand, and Pippin stares down at the leather-bound bundle of pipe-weed. A worried Merry exchanges glances with Gandalf. Gandalf mounts Shadowfax and spurs the great horse forward, thundering out of the stables, with a close-up on Merry's devastated face. Shadowfax carries Gandalf and Pippin out of the gate and down the winding road towards the plains of Rohan. Merry clambers up a watchtower, with Aragorn in pursuit, and watches his best friend disappear into the distance, knowing what it is to lose someone. Meanwhile, Arwen, escorted by a small entourage of elves, rides through the gathering darkness of a pine forest. As Arwen rides through the forest, a small boy of about five suddenly runs across the path in front of her. Arwen reigns in Asfaloth, intrigued by something about the boy, though she does not know why. As Arwen watches, the boy moves away, and the trees begin to thin.",
    "824": "Cal studies himself in a mirror and picks a shirt. They look through jackets, and Cal is measured for a suit. He opens his wallet and tries on a store trilby. In a jeans store, Jacob looks skywards and marches off, with Cal hurrying after him. Jacob turns back, shrugs, and slaps Cal's cheeks. In a hairdresser's, which is Cal's hairdresser, he steps out in his new garb. Jacob steps confidently over to Cal, and later, they sit in the bar together. Cal shrugs, and Jacob raises his eyebrows as Cal is wearing a sharp blue suit. Jacob and Cal approach a group of women on a couch. Amy looks down awkwardly, then turns away as Jacob points at Cal and she nods. Cal watches Jacob leave with all the different women, including two at the same time. A beautiful dark-haired woman with olive skin heads towards Cal, and he can't take his eyes off her. She wears a low-cut black dress and makes a beeline for him, shakes her silky hair from her face, and Cal smiles. She reaches the table and presents Cal with the bill, revealing they've racked up a bill of $837.57. Cal's smile disappears, and she presses the button, but the page comes out completely black. She screws her eyes shut as a guy spots her and stops, then comes into the room. In a classroom, a teacher writes on the blackboard while Robbie is texting on his mobile. At her locker, Jessica receives the text, frowns, shakes her head, and texts back. Robbie receives the text, stands, and a blonde girl smiles before he sits back down. Emily comes out of the assistant principal's office to Robbie, who is waiting, and they traipse out together. Robbie chuckles softly, Emily smiles, and puts an arm around his shoulder. In her office, Emily types at her computer and glances up as Robbie glides past her desk on an office chair, stopping opposite her. She glances at a photo on the shelf, then looks at Robbie, who shrugs. It's a photo of her and Cal. She lays it face down and turns back to Robbie, frowns, smiles, takes a deep breath, and continues typing. She nods somberly, knits her fingers together, and puts her head against her hands. David smiles, and Robbie shakes his head disapprovingly. Emily heads off, and David swaggers away, then pauses. He turns back and eyes Robbie, who stares back at him impassively. David heads back to Emily's office, glances around, and enters with a grin on his face. David sits, and Robbie pulls a lever under his chair, raising it so he looks down on David. She frowns at David, who waves, and Robbie places the photo of Emily and Cal firmly at the front of his mom's desk and marches out.",
    "490": "Malcolm points to the huge framed certificate propped up on a dining room chair, which is printed on aged parchment-type paper and housed in a polished mahogany frame. He slips on the sweatshirt as Anna's attention slowly moves to the framed certificate. She leans forward in her seat, reads the certificate out loud while Malcolm tries to tickle her, and then turns to Malcolm, who smiles. Anna takes Malcolm's hands and holds them steady, then lets go, her eyes emotional. Anna leans towards him, and they hold each other tight as their sweet laughter fills the house. Two giggling shadows appear in the bedroom doorway, trying to turn on the light, when a stranger slowly looks up for the first time, his eyes locking on Malcolm. The stranger suddenly moves forward into the doorway, causing Malcolm to stumble back onto the edge of the bed. Anna sees the stranger for the first time, her face draining of color. The stranger looks at Malcolm, half grins, as Anna's expression instantly changes. The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm, who stops all movement and stands. Tears fall down the stranger's face as Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words, and Vincent Gray stares with surprise through his tears. Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep waters as Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm, fully crying now. Vincent turns to the sink, his hand goes in, and he turns around, raises a gun at Malcolm, and fires. Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll onto the bed, and Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head. Handwritten notes fill every line as Malcolm glances through the page and sees words and phrases circled throughout the file. Sitting on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street, Malcolm gazes blankly at the brownstones until a door opens, bringing him out of his trance as Cole Sear steps out of his front door. Cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him, his hair dark with a small patch of jet white on the side. Cole carefully locks the door behind him, reaches into his pocket, and slips on a pair of very large glasses that look comical on him. Malcolm rises to his feet, but when he looks up, Cole is gone. Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy as Cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner. Stuffing the file in his bag, Malcolm starts running too, hauling down the sidewalk, and comes to a hard stop at a street intersection as Cole sprints across the empty lot, reaching the doors of a building.",
    "1102": "Sitting on his porch, he looks over at the road, where Sue helps two other women get out of a car. She walks over towards him as he sips from a beer can. He's tempted. They go next door. Walt opens the well-stocked fridge. He pats a child's head. Everyone gives him disapproving looks. Sue steers him away. At a buffet table, he looks at the buffet. Sue brings Walt another beer and finds him staring at the elder in ceremonial dress sitting across the room. The old man stares back. She goes over to Kor Khue. They go over to Walt. Walt sits down in a chair, and Kor Khue studies his craggy features. Walt looks thoughtful. Troubled Walt looks up at the diminutive Kor Khue, who nods. Walt gets to his feet and walks across the room. He looks into the next room, where some women are having tea. Sue watches him as he begins to cough. He coughed up blood onto the back of his hand. He quickly conceals it from Sue and hurries away upstairs. She follows him. Walt disappears into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He rinses his face in the basin and regards his reflection in the mirror. He dries his face. He opens the bathroom door. As he sits at the table, women fuss around him and load his plate with food. Sue wanders into the kitchen and finds him tucking in. Very reluctantly he gets up. Sue leads Walt down into the basement, where the younger generations of Hmongs have gathered. Walt looks singularly unimpressed. Sue smiles and goes towards Thao, who sits alone, away from the others. Walt leans against a tumble dryer. It rocks under his weight. He puts his beer down and fiddles about underneath the tumble dryer, adjusting its legs to stabilize it. Some of the youngsters look over at him, on his hands and knees. He notices them looking. He gets back up, pats the drier, and leans against it for a moment. Satisfied it's OK, he begins to wander across the basement. He eyes an attractive Hmong girl who's sitting with some boys. Walt notices she keeps glancing over at Thao. Walt drinks from a beer bottle and walks over to Sue who offers him a glass of clear liquid. He takes a sip and Sue wanders off. Walt puts his beer down and looks back over at the girl sitting with the boys. Walt glances over at Thao sitting on his own, looking miserable. She keeps looking at Thao. The girl gets up and walks up behind Walt. He turns around and sees her. She wanders off and he stares after her.",
    "632": "He stares into her eyes and nods. Graham's eyes fill with tears as he reaches out to take her hand in his and stares at her, puzzled, through his wet eyes as her head lowers. Graham remembers his conversation with Merrill, and his eyes, glazed with tears, focus on the alien as it rocks back and forth, leaning over its captive hanging limply over its arm. Graham turns slowly from the creature to face Merrill, spotting the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother. He turns back around to stare with stern determination at the alien. Merrill remains motionless, but then turns his gaze from the creature to Graham and looks behind him to the bat. The alien watches him, its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets. Merrill takes the bat down as the alien lowers its hand over Morgan's face, injecting a gray gash shooting from the spike into Morgan's nose. The alien turns, and Merrill launches himself at the creature, striking it in the back, causing the alien to drop Morgan and turn to face its assailant. Graham rushes over to pick up Morgan and the dropped syringe while Merrill strikes the creature in its abdomen. It falls into a side table, knocking over a glass of water, and as the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red wound erupts in its green-gray skin. Merrill and Graham stare around the room at the collection of discarded glasses of water, and Graham turns to Bo in astonishment before hurrying outside with Morgan in his arms, Bo following him. On the veranda, Bo looks back into the living room through a broken window as Graham heads out onto the lawn. Merrill swings the bat at glasses on the coffee table, and the alien recoils as its skin is splashed with liquid. Crouched on the lawn, Graham, holding his son across his thighs, adjusts the syringe and thrusts it into Morgan's leg. Merrill prepares for another strike, slamming the bat into the alien, causing the creature to topple over, landing on its back and knocking against a small sideboard, causing glasses on the sideboard to tip over, with water cascading down onto the crib. The broken head of the bat lies on the floor, surrounded by shards of glass, while the alien takes deep, difficult breaths, its chest sinking and failing to rise. Merrill hurries out into the garden and crouches down by Graham and Morgan. Graham, his eyes closed, cradles his limp son as Merrill presses Morgan's neck and recoils, turning away. Bo's face creases as she begins to sob, but then Graham opens his moistened eyes and his face shudders. Merrill swings round as Bo looks on in awe, and Graham turns, hardly daring to look at his son as Morgan lifts his head.",
    "1065": "They stare at each other and she smiles breathlessly, Drover smiles suavely at her, and she grins broadly. Allsop signals to the band as Drover makes his way down the steps towards the teeming dance floor. He and Sarah move slowly towards each other, and she smiles in delighted disbelief while he grins, his hand casually in his left pocket, as they come together. She smiles demurely, and arm-in-arm, they head for the dance floor. Carney's wife and the other women stare at them, while up on a balcony, Fletcher grabs a black waitress' hand. Sarah helps him through the steps as Carney watches and swigs from a bottle, and Fletcher does the same. Carney watches the dance, laughing heartily and drinks deeply. Drover and Sarah dance cheek-to-cheek, she smiles and nods. In the night, lightning flashes over Darwin Wharf, and he looks at her seriously. She turns and looks up at the storm clouds then closes her eyes, tilting her face up to catch the rain. They kiss as it starts to pour down, and the crowds at the pub cheer the rain's arrival and dance in the street. At the outdoor theater, the audience leave their seats, all except Nullah, who continues to stare, transfixed, at the screen. The ball guests huddle on the colonnaded verandah of the house where Carney holds court, as people dance around Drover and Sarah in the rain-soaked street. Sarah holds her hands joyfully in the air while Goolaj remains in his seat at the theater smiling happily at the downpour. Smiling, Fletcher staggers towards the soaking dance floor, trips over a plant pot, and falls flat on his face. Sarah kisses Drover as Carney steps away from his daughter to approach Fletcher. Sarah and Drover continue to kiss passionately, their eyes lock together, but she closes the cab door rather than get in. A servant holds an umbrella over Carney's head as he walks up to the fallen Fletcher, scowls at his drunken son-in-law, and walks off, while Fletcher nods slowly, watching him go. On the screen, Dorothy clicks her emerald heels together, as Drover and Sarah run up the stairs to Sarah's room with the balcony. Indoors, they kiss passionately, break apart, and stare at one another. They look longingly at each other, and naked in bed, they make love tenderly. He kisses her neck, they touch gently, he slides the dress off her shoulders, and she opens the front of his shirt. She pulls the shirt off his muscled torso and, in just her petticoat, pulls him down onto the bed. They lie in each other's arms, naked, covered by just a sheet, as the door to the room swings closed, with lightning flashing and the rain pouring down on nighttime Darwin.",
    "662": "At the Genetic Research Institute, a monitor behind Peter displays the DNA of a new species of spider like the one which bit him. Meanwhile, a man in a green flight suit stands on a levitating glider. Norman turns to Strom as the general walks away, leaving Norman pensive. In a suburban house, Peter's Uncle Ben changes a light bulb while Peter, leaving his concerned aunt and uncle downstairs, absently makes his way upstairs to his room. He strips off his shirt and vest, his skinny frame wavering in front of a tall mirror, then collapses on his bed before rolling onto the floor. He grabs the tartan blanket from the bed and hauls it over himself. Flashing through Peter's mind are images of spiders, DNA, a helix being split, and another part being fused, sending a surge of power. At Oscorp, Norman strips to the waist and takes a bottle from Strom, gulping down its contents. He flings the bottle to the floor, lifts open the metal on the sliding trolley, and lies down on it. Strom fastens the manacles over Norman's chest, legs, and upper arms, firmly attaching him to the trolley. The grim-faced Strom hurries to a control panel as the trolley glides into a large glass chamber. The doors slide closed, the trolley raises from horizontal to vertical, and Norman remains firmly locked in. Strom looks on as Norman nods to him. Strom pushes a switch and watches as a large file containing a green liquid empties, vapor rising in the chamber and engulfing Norman. Strom observes a computer-generated image of the green gas level in the chamber rising and monitors Norman's physiology as his heart rate increases to 140. Norman's body convulses, prompting Strom to run to the panel and vent the gas chamber. Norman's head shakes, showing only the whites of his eyes before he flat lines. Strom enters the chamber and attempts heart massage standing up. The pulse returns, Norman's eyes flash open, and he grabs Strom by the throat, flinging him through the glass of the chamber. Now freed, Norman leaps out strong. Meanwhile, Peter wakes from his fitful sleep and picks himself up off the floor, reaching for his spectacles. He puts them on, then quickly takes them off, trying again before removing them once more. He holds them up in front of his face, realizing that when he looks through them everything is blurred, but when he moves them away his vision is clear.",
    "1082": "Asael covers up the potato stash with some sacking and climbs out of the hole. In one of the huts, Layla sits huddled at a table while Shimon and Malbin are trying to keep a chess game going on their knees. Weaver, the nurse, is rubbing ointment onto a man's frost-bitten toes. Rachel is sitting with her grandfather, and Lazar addresses those present. In his cabin, Tuvia knocks back some vodka and stares grimly ahead, and later in the snowy woodland, he comes into a clearing holding his horse by its bridle, strokes its white muzzle, and with a deep sigh takes his revolver out of its holster. Malbin, hurrying through the snow with an armful of kindling, stops in his tracks as Arkady insists on a bigger portion than the rest. Morosely, Tuvia watches the people elbowing each other out of the way and walks past Malbin without acknowledging him. Elsewhere in the forest, Commander Panchenko and Gramov ride ahead of the column of soldiers who are walking behind them. At their base camp, Zus gulps back some vodka and passes the bottle to Panchenko, who drains it and tosses it over his shoulder. Zus looks across at Viktor Panchenko and turns his face to the side. At the camp, Tuvia, in his heavy gray coat and hat, machine gun over his shoulder, steps into a dark cabin where Lilka is sitting by a stove. He puts the gun down, whips off his hat, throws a small log into the stove, smiles at her as he rubs his hands and his cheeks tense. He drapes his coat around her shoulders, and she thanks him with a nod. Reaching into his trouser pocket, he brings out his revolver, flashes her a brief smile, and she goes, observed from outside the door by Arkady who leers in at him. Lazar is with a wounded man as Tuvia sees Lilka setting off to find food. Lilka, wrapped up in Tuvia's coat and her shawl over her head with a bag over her shoulder, goes off into the wintry forest and wanders into a frosty dell. There are animal tracks in the snow ahead of her, and through the mist, she sees an Alsatian staring back at her. She starts to retreat, and the hound bounds towards her; she turns and runs as it leaps on her back, knocking her down. She leans up against a tree and watches in terror as it tears at the food stock with its sharp teeth. She stretches out her hand to reach the sack, and as the dog bares its teeth and leaps up, they both fall to the ground. She raises her head, holding the gun, and walks back to camp with the dead dog slung across her shoulders.",
    "275": "A policeman from inside the house is taking Nathan by the elbow, and as Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house, he calls back over his shoulder. We follow the two, hand-held, as the police lead Nathan toward the living room. The room is filled with policemen milling about in several different uniforms: local police, state troopers, and plainclothes detectives. The original policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a white-smocked technician is preparing an inkpad and exemplar sheets. The dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire, and overlapping. Byrum has taken Nathan's right hand and is rolling its fingers onto the inkpad, but Nathan jerks his hand away. Two men in conservative suits are approaching as Nathan gives his hand back and raises his voice at an offscreen bellower. Nathan is getting worked up and he grabs the overcoat being displayed by FBI #2. Nathan realizes that he's gotten ink from his fingerprinting all over the coat and furiously kicks it. Throughout the speech, Nathan stalks the room, working himself into a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters, generally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping their feet off his furniture. Specifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth that Gale and Evelle climbed out of. We are pulling back to reveal the feet—the shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs—becoming quickly spattered—of several policemen milling about the hole, while German shepherds sniff around. With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter the frame, and the bike's jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police step back, and dogs skitter away to give him room. He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the bike, while the whipcracking biker cue mixes up. The biker shakes his head; he doesn't think they went that way. Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the biker's head snaps to profile as he stares across the field, stock-still, having heard, smelled, or sensed something. The dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to attention a split second after the biker, as a jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field. After a moment, their attention returns to the hole, and his attention also returns to the matter at hand as he squints, concentrating. His bike rumbles. It is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle combing their hair, now empty. The bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle, which grows louder, then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station. Suddenly, we hear the screech of the bike's brakes, and we are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle screeches to a halt in the foreground.",
    "251": "Vincent smiles and Mia giggles as Vincent turns around. We're in the living room of a modest two-bedroom house in Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. Butch's mother, around 35, stands in the doorway leading into the living room, next to a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The camera captures the perspective of a five-year-old boy as Koons steps inside the room toward the child, bending on one knee to match the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he has a slight Texas accent and pulls a gold wristwatch out of his pocket, handing it to Butch. A little hand enters the frame to accept it. The 27-year-old Butch Coolidge is shown dressed in boxing regalia—trunks, shoes, and gloves—lying on a table catching a few zzzz's before a big fight. He wakes up suddenly, shaken by the bizarre memory, and wipes his sweaty face with a boxing glove. His trainer Klondike, an older fireplug, opens the door slightly, peeking into the room as pandemonium breaks out behind him in the hallway. A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium, and we slowly dolly toward the parked car while the sound of the car radio is heard from inside. A young woman with Spanish looks sits in the car, drinking steaming hot coffee from a white Styrofoam cup as sportscasters continue their coverage. Esmarelda clicks the radio off, sips her coffee, and hears a noise from behind in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to investigate and sees a window about three stories high open on the auditorium side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below, followed by Butch Coolidge, still in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves, and a yellow robe, leaping into the dumpster. Esmarelda registers the strangeness of this scene as Butch, soaking wet and naked except for his trunks, shoes, and gloves, hops into the backseat and slams the door. Esmarelda stares straight ahead and talks to Butch through the rearview mirror as he gets one of his boxing gloves off. Esmarelda watches in the rearview mirror, then presses a button to roll down the back window. Butch tosses his boxing glove out, starts untying the other one, and Esmarelda can’t stay quiet anymore. As he tosses his other glove out the window, he finishes wiping himself down and tosses the towel out. Silence ensues as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt.",
    "1193": "Hagrid lifts Harry down, and Malfoy struts forward. Buckbeak rears and attacks Malfoy, and Hagrid lifts Malfoy up. As Hagrid carries Malfoy away, the hippogriff gently nudges Harry, and he strokes its beak. Back at Hogwarts, a ghostly knight crashes through a window carrying a severed head, and a headless horseman follows him through the Great Hall. Harry stares at the picture of Sirius Black in the newspaper and sees a raging man with wild, staring eyes struggling violently with his prison guards. A foxglove grows in stony ground, and a Dementor floats past. Frost appears on the petals, and the flower immediately dies. A wardrobe, and he whispers to Neville. The wardrobe door slowly opens, and Professor Snape steps out, dressed as an old lady with a red handbag. Ron is pushed to the front, and Ron steps forward, reluctantly. Snape becomes a huge, black spider, and Ron's hair stands on end as it moves towards him, clicking its pincers. He reaches for his wand as it wears roller-skates and sprawls across the floor. Parvati faces a huge cobra and a jack in the box. Harry steps forward, and Lupin watches him closely. A hideous Dementor, and Lupin jumps in front of him. A full moon appears, half hidden by clouds, and the moon becomes a balloon, which zooms around the classroom and back into the wardrobe. Ron and Hermione follow the other students, leaving Harry alone in the quadrangle. Harry talks to Professor Lupin, and Harry grins, proudly. On the staircase, and the other portraits are distraught. Weeping and wailing, the painted characters run from picture to picture. Dumbledore and Filch, the caretaker, stare at the empty painting. Dumbledore runs his finger across the slashed canvas as Filch looks around, suspiciously. In a picture of the African plains, the fat lady hides behind a hippopotamus. The heavy portcullis is lowered, and the huge gates are closed and firmly secured by a system of strong iron locks, which swing neatly into place, one after the other. The Dementors keep guard outside the school as all of the students sleep in the Great Hall. Harry is wide-awake and listening. On the ceiling of the Great Hall, a star shoots across the celestial sky. A single autumn leaf flutters down from the Whomping Willow, then all the leaves fall at once and the tree shakes its bare branches. Snape enters the classroom and closes the shutters with his wand, and he pulls down a screen. They open their books. Malfoy has his arm in a sling, and he taps a projector and turns Ron's pages. Malfoy throws Harry an animated cartoon of Harry being hit on the head in a Quidditch match. An umbrella is whirled aloft by a gale force wind, and around the Quidditch pitch, sodden spectators stand in the driving rain, cheering their teams.",
    "889": "He falters for a moment, then his smile returns. Lydia and Kitty are enjoying a card game with the officers. Mr. Wickham, now resplendent in his red uniform, watches them with amusement before sitting down next to Lizzie. He leans forward in his seat. They smile at Lydia's celebrations. Lizzie looks thoughtful. Her eyes meet Mr. Wickham's and they smile at each other warmly. She watches him dance with Lydia and smiles to herself. A bedroom. She lowers her eyes coyly. Jane looks unsure. He giggles. A look between Lizzie and Jane. Lydia and Kitty are being pushed on a swing by two uniformed officers. Mr. Collins reluctantly follows Jane, leaving Wickham and Lizzie alone. They stroll through the garden together. She turns to him. They watch as Kitty jumps from the swing into the arms of an officer. Then, they set off walking again. Lizzie smiles contentedly to herself. Now, Mrs. Bennet rushes into Lizzie's room, where a maid is seeing to her hair. Lizzie pops out her cheeks. She runs out of the room. Mr. Collins is leaving his room. He's shocked to bump into the half-dressed Lydia. He tries to pass her, but the landing is too small. He covers his eyes and walks hurriedly past the giggling Lydia. Knowing the laughter is at him, he regains his composure before heading down the stairs. Night time at Netherfield Hall. A constant stream of carriages drop guests at the doors. Mr. Collins helps Lizzie and Jane down from their carriage. As they make their way up a flight of steps, Lizzie spots Darcy looking out of a window. He catches her eye, then turns away. The family makes its way inside, where their cloaks are taken by footmen in wigs. Jane and Lizzie look around the room excitedly before being received by the Bingleys. Lizzie steps away from her family and looks around the room searchingly. Mr. Bingley standing with Jane calls over to her. He offers her his arm, then leads them both through to the next room. Musicians are playing at one end of a large wooden-floored room. Mr. Bingley escorts the sisters proudly through the gathered guests, nodding greetings to uniformed officers and finely attired ladies. Lizzie looks around the other guests while Jane and Bingley chatter happily together. A hopeful smile plays across her lips when she spots a group of red-coated officers gathered in a corner. Darcy is standing a little behind the group. He turns his head, and he and Lizzie catch each other's eye for a moment before she hastily looks away. He continues looking at her. A beautiful smile crosses her face, when Denny breaks away from the others and joins her.",
    "410": "Ben turns and walks down the hall, then they enter the sunroom. She nods, and he looks at her as she pours herself a drink and hands him one. She turns on the phonograph, and Ben looks at her. They look at each other, and Ben is half standing. He puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair. She looks at him, then Mrs. Robinson and Ben move out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs, and along the hall to the doorway of Elaine's room. Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait while Mrs. Robinson watches him in the background. He steps back, and she turns her back. Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down, and Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor. Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall as the camera pushes with him to the door. We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall as Ben gets to the stairs and starts down. She walks out of the shot, and Ben starts back up the stairs. Ben slowly climbs the stairs, gets to the top, and starts slowly down the hall. Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed, and puts the purse down. As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait and notices a movement reflected in the glass. He turns quickly to see Mrs. Robinson, naked, shutting the door to the bedroom behind her. She smiles, and Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets it open, runs into the hall, and down the stairs. Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down, then jumps up to get the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again. There is the sound of the front door opening and closing, and footsteps approach the sunroom. Mr. Robinson enters, reaches for Ben's glass, takes it from him, then turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Mr. Robinson turns and brings Ben the drink, but Ben shakes his head and then nods. Mrs. Robinson enters, now wearing the dress she wore earlier. Ben starts to get up, then sits back down as Mrs. Robinson nods. He stands, and Mr. Robinson stands up with him as they start out of the sunroom. Ben nods and continues to walk toward us as the sun shines brightly. Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, and the Arnold children, Peter and Louise, who are eight or nine, while watching from across the fence on one side of the house are the young girl from next door and her boyfriend.",
    "1121": "Chasing after Harry, the Bludger crashes through the towers one by one. Harry swoops lower to the grass, but the Bludger follows him closely. Draco watches with a smug expression on his face as the Bludger crashes through another tower. Harry flies back over the arena to see Draco hovering in front of him, and suddenly he sees the Golden Snitch beside Draco's head. They both duck as the Bludger hurtles past. Then Harry heads for the Snitch, closely followed by Draco, who elbows him out of the way. Draco takes the lead as the Snitch disappears under the wooden scaffolding supporting the spectators' stands. Draco flies after it, closely followed by Harry, who swerves to avoid a solid wooden beam. The Snitch is too fast for Draco's grasping fingers, and Harry is still being chased by the heavy wooden Bludger. Determined to stay ahead, Draco grits his teeth and looks around in dismay as Harry catches him up and gradually overtakes. Now, close behind Draco, the heavy Bludger crashes into the wooden beams. They weave over and under the wooden struts until Draco catches up again and bashes Harry in the ribs. They fly neck and neck, the Snitch just out of reach, as they flash past Colin with his camera, who ducks. The Bludger flies over his head and smashes through a wooden support. Harry takes the lead again, and the Bludger streaks past them both, weaving from side to side in front of them and smashing holes in the sides of the structure. Suddenly, it turns and hurtles back towards them, and Draco's broomstick catches on a wooden strut. He somersaults into the air and lands heavily on the grass of the arena while Harry continues pursuing the Golden Snitch. As Harry stretches out his hand to grasp it, a rogue Bludger smashes into his arm. Wincing with pain, he grasps his broomstick between his knees, stretches out his good hand, and grabs the Snitch. Then he overbalances, falls off, and lands on his back on the soft sand beneath the goal post, where his friends rush to join him. The Bludger hits the sand beside Harry, and Hermione's spell works, causing the Bludger to explode in mid-air. Everyone runs towards Harry, and Lockhart pushes up Harry's sleeve as Ron and Hagrid look alarmed. Harry's arm goes completely limp and floppy, and he folds the wrist back on itself. Afterward, in the hospital wing, he drinks some medicine. Late at night, while Harry is lying fast asleep, a strange noise wakes him. He opens his eyes, sits up, and looks around, but the room seems empty until he puts on his glasses and sees a figure sitting at the end of his bed. The figure's fingers are covered in bandages, and Dobby jumps down.",
    "983": "Now a toddler, Caroline sleeps beside Daisy, and watched by Benjamin, Daisy wakes. They sit with Caroline in a park as Daisy stares at him, while chubby-cheeked Caroline plays with a toy caterpillar. Balloons decorate the dining room of their duplex, and parents sit at the table with their children. Benjamin goes to the kitchen and looks back into the dining room, where Daisy sits with little Caroline on her knee. A decorative figure of a little girl adorns the remains of a pretty, white birthday cake as the guests have departed. Daisy washes up in the kitchen, watching Benjamin through a Venetian blind as he sits on a wall outside, with Caroline in his lap. Caroline lets go of a yellow helium balloon, which floats away into the sky, and Daisy smiles. Benjamin watches Caroline sleeping in her cot, takes a bulging envelope from the old dresser drawer and a savings book from a small box, and puts them on top of the dresser with a house key. Daisy lies in bed, watching him, and they meet each other's gaze, sharing a long look. Benjamin retreats into the shadows and leaves the room as Daisy sits up in bed while he heads for the front door. Daisy throws back the bed covers, and Benjamin, zipping up his jacket, goes to his motorcycle in the cold, blue light of dawn. Daisy sits on the edge of the bed as Benjamin rides his motorcycle down the driveway, to the road, and she stands at her window, watching as he rides away. Caroline sits in the corner, turns a page of the diary to find a number of postcards bound with an elastic band, removes it, and reads the back of one. Sallow-skinned Daisy watches from the bed as Caroline leafs through the postcards, flipping another postcard over and reading it, while Daisy listens and closes her eyes. Caroline unfolds a letter as Benjamin backpacks through India, locals wash in a river, and he wakes in a sleeping bag, looking out over a beautiful, desolate landscape and mending his motorbike. Now a young man, he carries groceries down a street as a dying Daisy frowns. Fifty-something Daisy crosses her dance studio while little girls file through a windowed office as she puts an arm into one sleeve of her coat, switches off the studio lights as parents usher their children out of the building, then finishes putting her coat on as she starts across the darkened foyer. A figure stands by the door and steps forward; his mid-length hair is a sun-kissed blond, his build slighter, and his skin smoother, and he shrugs. Caroline is 12, Daisy hangs her head, they shake hands, and a gray-haired man enters. Robert looks confused, looks at Daisy who's fighting back tears, and then strokes Caroline's hair.",
    "1015": "The guy runs out, and his towel falls to the ground. Abby covers her eyes. Inside, D'Artagnan cozies up to the guy. Abby's mouth hangs open in a big, toothy grin, her eyes twinkle, and she is transfixed. The guy points to the door and reopens it. Abby dances for joy. On set, the makeup girl goes. Abby roughly forces an earpiece into Mike's ear. Outside, the chicks pull him in. Mike licks the red Jell-O off one of the girl's fingers and gives an approving nod. Abby takes deep breaths as Mike comes in with the bikini babes, who then head off. She walks off. Abby wakes up from her naked weather-girl nightmare. Abby and Joy are in the tea-break area of the office, looking at the ratings. Mike walks in, following Abby to her office. Sitting at her desk, Abby gives Mike a challenging look, picks up a card and the phone, and dials. Mike grabs a phone to listen on but hangs Abby up. Mike flops into a chair, puts the phone on hold, glances aside, and nods while looking at the timer on Abby's phone display. Abby looks thoughtful. At the hospital, handsome, clean-cut Colin keeps holding. In a cafe, in a boutique, they look at dresses with a saleswoman. Abby holds a dress against herself. On the way home, sitting in Abby's living room, Mike reaches down the side of the chair and picks up some knitting, frowns, and quickly dumps it back on the floor. Abby comes downstairs, looking extremely sexy in black stilettos and a figure-hugging, low-cut black dress that stops at her knees, with her long, blonde hair hanging loose in flowing curls. She smirks, strokes his chest, and he slaps her bum. Mike crouches behind the couch, smiles, and gives Abby the thumbs-up. Abby does a little victory dance, punching the air. At the baseball game, the pitcher pitches, and the batter hits. As Abby and Colin walk to their seats, Mike talks to Abby on an earpiece and sits nearby. She munches popcorn with an exaggerated shrug. The batter sprints around the field, and the fans stand up excitedly. Colin tries to get the attention of a food vendor. A girl grins at Mike and lifts the hot dog to her lips, but shocked, she spills her drink in Colin's lap. A cameraman films Abby as she rubs the stain, her head bent over Colin's crotch, and her hair swishes back and forth, making it look like she's doing something quite different. She looks up and sees herself in a heart-shaped video screen above the scoreboard, the Kiss Cam. Abby and Colin walk home.",
    "576": "A flicker of a shadow appears from behind the corner of the obscured glass at the section of the room most distant from Parrish, indicating a shape is there. Parrish falls silent, the sound and tone of the voice rendering him mute. He takes a step backward and struggles to make sense of what he is hearing. After a moment, the figure, who is the source of the voice, steps forward, revealing himself to be the young man seen previously in the coffee shop, but with a change; he seems odd, off-center, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful. A moment passes with Parrish beside himself as the young man steps closer to him, his face inches from Parrish's, daring him to identify him. Parrish turns away, but the young man reappears in front of him, spectacularly. Stunned and terrified by the realization, Parrish surveys the young man, who now seems bewildered by his own effect. A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment, then a sound at the door causes him to look at Luisa and then at the young man, verifying the young man's presence has been acknowledged by Luisa. Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits, leaving Parrish frozen, dumbfounded, and frightened by the response. Hesitant, Parrish then obediently leads the young man out of the library, down a long hallway, and across the foyer. As they enter, Allison's voice is heard in the background. Parrish and the young man appear at the table, and an awkward pause ensues as the unannounced guest’s presence at a family dinner is noted, with the guest himself being carefully surveyed. Horribly uncomfortable, Parrish watches as the young man looks at each person as if discovering a face for the first time, leading to another awkward pause, with the group waiting patiently. Parrish desperately searches for a last name, with a furtive glance at Joe, and a name tumbles from his lips as Luisa sets a plate in front of Joe and returns Parrish's plate, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed. Joe looks over at the other guests, picks up his utensils gingerly, tries to copy the others, and stops, staring at his food. Parrish falls silent again, searching for an answer, as Susan kisses Drew in a light, humorous way, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys, lips meeting mid-air, and at the kiss's conclusion, Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching.",
    "1069": "Drover staggers, distraught, through the burning wreck of the Carney house, sobbing in uncontrollable grief, as the flickering flames illuminate the calm figure of King George, while others mill around trying to help. Drover walks through the town, with King George shadowing him, looking out across the bay at the broken, burning hulks of ships, and walks towards the shattered pub where some people are trying to patch it up, while others sit around staring or drinking vacantly. He approaches Ivan, who's sweeping up in the bar, followed by Magarri. Drover looks around, taking in the white drinkers and his nervous black brother-in-law, then turns slowly back to Ivan, who stares as tears of grief and rage run down his face, while the bar patrons stare as he looks round at Magarri. Magarri enters tentatively, removes his hat, and approaches the bar, as a woman glares at him, drawing on a cigarette. Ivan has placed a glass and a tin cup on the bar, and tears roll down Drover's cheeks. Reluctantly, Ivan replaces the cup with another glass, and looks at Magarri, raising a glass. Magarri eyeballs him, glances at Drover, and they all take a drink, placing the empty glasses on the bar. Magarri wipes away a tear as Drover frowns in disbelief. Dutton checks the body on the stretcher as Sarah comes in, and his eyes bore into her, trying to make her understand. Meanwhile, a priest is down at the wharf, as Drover releases the mooring, takes a chain out of Bull's unconscious hand, and runs onto the small Mission Island sailing boat, while the priest prays. Magarri holds a rifle and Drover stands holding a rope as they get underway, while Sarah stares, grief-stricken, at the devastation. The wooden buildings of the Mission burn fiercely in the night, as Drover, Magarri, and Ivan stand staring on the beach. Drover nods to Magarri, who moves off, then moves fearfully up the beach, weapons raised, passing burning buildings and approaching the tree line. Drover looks into a building and sees a row of boys' shoes, looks horrified, and lowers his rifle, as his eyes fill with tears. He turns towards a noise, raising his rifle as something moves in the undergrowth, and a boy emerges. Drover lowers his weapon as more children come out of the undergrowth and smiles with relief as Magarri beckons the boys forward. Another figure with long hair appears, and they embrace, throwing their arms around one another. Drover holds the boy out at arm's length, grins happily, stroking his hair, as Nullah hangs his head sadly. A torch beam sweeps across the water towards them as they look around fearfully, while armed figures march out of the jungle through the smoke.",
    "516": "She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her. Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her. Elliot nods. Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking. As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen. Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the Edward Estlin Cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating. Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away. He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she bumps against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable. Lee, shocked, is gasping. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee. She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book. Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving. The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street. He picks up the phone and dials. The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone. Frederick picks it up. When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner. Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes. She sighs. Lee looks at him. She sighs. She walks off. Elliot stares after her, grinning. He laughs. A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning. It's an overcast day. A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab.",
    "1384": "Harry glances warily from the steaming tureen of green to Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum and frees a walnut sliver, while Fudge turns and smiles nervously. Harry eyes the stack of books, noticing that one is bound by a rope, and through the window, the rooftops of London are visible. As a train passes, the camera pulls back to reveal Harry standing with Hedwig; he turns and eyes his schoolbooks. He studies the growling tome, The Monster Book of Monsters, and gives the rope a tug, causing the book to leap to the floor, with pages flying and book covers snapping. Harry gives chase, but the book turns and begins nipping viciously at his shoes. He vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, and then grabs a pillow. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view, and Harry pounces, muffling the book's roar beneath the pillow. A young witch in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall as Harry exits his room just as she knocks on a door. Upon opening the door, she's greeted by a thunderous roar and a rush of wind, and something small and fast dashes by Harry's feet. He sees a ragged-looking rat, Scabbers, pursued by an ugly orange cat, Crookshanks. As Harry moves down the stairs, voices emerge from below. Once he reaches the bottom, he finds Ron Weasley protectively cradling Scabbers, while Hermione Granger tries to restrain a hissing Crookshanks. Sensing another presence in the room, both Ron and Hermione turn to face him. In the accompanying photo, the entire Weasley family stands before the Great Pyramids, waving, with Ron in the middle and Scabbers perched on his shoulder. Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands and smiles as Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster. Meanwhile, Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue, then hesitates again, and she points. Just then, the compartment rattles, lanterns flicker, and the train lurches, beginning to slow. Harry rises, slides open the door, and peers into the corridor. From Harry's point of view, all along the carriage, heads look out curiously. Then the train jerks, the car sways, and the lamps running along the ceiling flicker and die. A thin wisp of steam escapes Ron's mouth as he stands, a dark silhouette against the window, wiping a patch of condensation from it. Suddenly, the car sways violently, and from the stick in the hands of R.J. Lupin emanates a shivering light; his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert and wary. Hermione's troubled face hovers above Harry as he sits up, and Ron, pale and nervous, extends his hand to give Harry his glasses. As Harry leaves, he turns to Ron and Hermione, but she shakes her head. Harry then looks to the window, and the reflection in it comes into focus.",
    "1095": "At a rest stop, an old woman wrapped in a heavy shawl chews on some food. A man bites into an apple. Asael and Chaya sit together. People huddled on the ground look up at Tuvia, but only Zus stands up, draping his machine gun over his shoulder. Tuvia nods, and the two of them set off, both wearing caps and scarves wrapped around their necks. A Russian in a gray army coat and fur hat steps out from behind a tree. Soldiers surround the Bielski brothers, who put up their hands without resistance. Zus steps forward as the man shrugs and beckons for them to follow him. He strolls off ahead whistling and leads them into a military camp past a soldier on horseback. A middle-aged man with bags under his eyes, a black fur hat, and a black leather coat over his coffee uniform emerges from a tent. Zus shoots a glance at his brother's impassive face as the commander smirks. Tuvia salutes, and Panchenko returns the salute. The whistling Russian Gramov escorts them out of the camp. A view of a thick pine forest appears as Tuvia rides up on a white horse and with quiet pride, watches his flock, young and old, busily building a new camp. Aron and Asael saw wood, Arkady hammers a roof beam, Shimon in his hat, overcoat, and scarf wields an axe, and Malbin uses an axe handle to secure a nail. Tuvia tosses him a hammer while Zus overhears and scowls, listening uneasily. Later, Asael comes into the camp with more people. Bella is peeling potatoes. A man kneels down, taking off his hat and kisses the ground. He looks around eagerly and addresses Benzion. Tuvia glances at Malbin as Itzak bends to kiss Tuvia's hand. Malbin leads Itzak away past Zus, who scowls at Tuvia. Chaya turns to Asael. Tuvia smiles coldly, and Zus whacks Tuvia in the face as Asael and Chaya watch in dismay. Shimon, Malbin, Lazar, and the others look accusingly at Zus. Zus steps towards Tuvia, who's looking at the blood on his fingers. Tuvia hits back and launches himself at his brother. Benzion tries to pull them apart but is shoved to one side. Zus' next blow sends Tuvia reeling to the ground, and Aron looks at them both in shock. Zus rolls Tuvia on his back with a flick of his foot, and Tuvia slowly scrambles to his feet. Zus spits and whacks his brother again with another kick, then pulls him up with both hands and slams him back onto the muddy ground. As he goes to do it again, Tuvia fists him in the groin, pushes Zus down on his back, picks up a round stone, and prepares to throw it.",
    "401": "Jody runs, whipping through the trees--always ahead of him. The old man pours whiskey into a teacup, then pours Fergus more whiskey. The ferry churns into the sunset. FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust is hacking at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He is knocking the bricks from an outer wall, working furiously and relentlessly, like a machine. We see the wall with the hammer striking it, and one brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole as more bricks fall away. Through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight we now see a patch of green. His rhythm slows, and more bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops, and the dust begins to clear. The dust drifts across it, revealing a cricket pitch with tiny sticklike figures running on the green. Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street and enters through a white door. Fergus is dressing. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country boy in a big city, and takes Jody's wallet from the trousers of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the soldier and Dil, and puts it in the pocket of his suit. Fergus walks down a street looking for an address. Some distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR. Fergus stands as the crowds go by him, looking in the window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his point of view, then Fergus walks inside and enters. She leaves the salon, checks her watch, and stubs out a cigarette. She comes toward him and fiddles with his hair, pushes his head back into a basin behind him, and begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo. The hands with the purple nails run over his scalp. Fergus sits up as she begins to cut and imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs. Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair, and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows. Dil makes her way through it and sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat.",
    "386": "The scenes begin with music and head credits playing over various bowling shots—pins flying, graceful releases, balls gliding down lanes, bowlers hoisting balls, sliding feet, and a ball return spinning up a ball. The music transitions into boomy source music from a distant jukebox as the credits end over a clattering strike. A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench. The focus shifts to a big man nursing a large plastic cup of Bud, with dark worried eyes, a goatee, hairy legs emerging from khaki shorts, and wearing a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt. Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next to Walter. The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, has foam on his mustache. Reflected in a plaque, the Dude is seen entering the room with a young man. The plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Jeffrey Lebowski as Achiever of the Year. The Dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look, as does Brandt, the young man in a suit with his hands clasped in front of his groin. The track and pan reveal a framed Life Magazine cover titled \"ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER?\" with the Dude's sunglassed face on it, showing the display is mirrored. A fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair, Jeff Lebowski, enters, wheeling himself behind a desk. The Dude sits facing him as Brandt withdraws. The Dude rises and heads for the door, opens it, and shuts it on the old man's bellowing. Outside, a houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder walks through a back lawn past a swimming pool to a garage, followed by Brandt and the Dude. They arc around a woman's foot as she finishes painting her nails emerald green, looking up at the Dude. In her early twenties, she leans back and extends her leg toward him. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose, peeks over them, tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot, and she waggles it, giggling. The Dude looks over at the pool, where a man in his thirties with long stringy blond hair is passed out in an inflatable chair.",
    "87": "The preacher's eyes crinkle as he turns to Pearl, smiling brightly, but then his eyes snap back to John and his voice becomes like a whip, never leaving John's eyes. Pearl gapes up at John as he speaks, and as he gets up, the cellar door is in the background. The children cross him towards the door, preceding the preacher who carries a candle in a holder, while Pearl is gaping at John's lie. John looks left and right, casing the joint, and now they are at the bottom of the stairs. John sees Pearl's expression, takes her hand, squeezes it harder, and points. He points out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason jars, at the most distant part of the cellar from the stairs. The preacher starts toward it, leaving them at the foot of the stairs, then turns, catching John's ruse, and shepherds them ahead of him. They arrive beneath the shelf, where the preacher sets the candle on a barrel near a shelf-prop and sinks to his knees below shot as Pearl gapes at John and John looks stony, and she seems about to speak. The preacher's hands sweep dust and expose concrete. He straightens on his knees and turns to the children in the close background, his sincerity beyond doubt, and takes his knife out, springing it open. She starts to sob, and the preacher is astounded as his hands fall away from John. He leans back against the wall and talks through laughter, his eyes all over the place. The preacher makes a lunge across John for the doll, but John ducks under his arm, pulls Pearl forward with his left hand, turns backwards, and with his free hand, knocks over the candle and pulls out the support on the shelf. Jars shower over him; one crowns him and breaks, shedding guck, which he wipes from his eyes, and they start up the stairs. He makes one step forward, steps on a rolling jar, and falls. They are near the top of the stairs as John slips and they nearly fall backward, but John recovers, and the preacher enters the shot, his back to us. The children get through the open door as the preacher reaches the top, and John slams the door, catching the preacher's hand. The preacher screams as John's astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door, which loosens; the preacher yanks his hand loose, sucks it, groaning, and the door slams shut, the bolt is shot home, and he snarls like the Big Bad Wolf. Pearl, dangling her doll, cries, as John, panting, leans against the wall by the door, wondering what to do next. A pretty, pastoral shot of the house in light mist is seen as they run across and leave the shot, and before they disappear, we hear the preacher's fists hammering against the door.",
    "102": "At the ribbon-cutting ceremony, a postman delivers a letter to Bubba's mom, who opens it surrounded by her many children, looks at the check, and faints. A door opens as a white woman serves Bubba's mom some shrimp. Forrest rides the mower, and as he steps onto the porch, he looks down the road. Jenny's image walks and then vanishes, causing Forrest to look away. He turns and walks into the house, where Jenny walks across the lawn to him. Jenny lies asleep in bed, followed by Forrest and Jenny walking together. She breaks a window, collapses to the ground and sobs, and Forrest kneels down next to her. They sit on a limb together, and later, Jenny sits by the vase of flowers and looks out the window. Forrest closes his eyes as he sits on the porch. Jenny places a box of Nike running shoes in his lap as they sit on a log together looking at the river, and Jenny places her arms around Forrest. She turns off the TV and walks outside. Forrest stands, puts down his Dr. Pepper, and watches Jenny walk toward the stairs. Forrest turns and walks toward the door, while Jenny turns and walks up the stairs. Forrest stands outside as the house stands in the rain. He lies in bed as the door opens and Jenny gets into bed next to him. Jenny and Forrest kiss, and Jenny takes off her nightgown as they make love. Jenny carries her purse and walks toward a waiting cab that drives away while Forrest is asleep in his bed. The Congressional Medal lies on a table by a ping-pong paddle as Forrest holds a glass of milk and wears his bathrobe, looking at the medal he had given to Jenny. Jenny's bed is made, so Forrest stands in the doorway looking at the room and bed where Jenny had been, standing still as if in a trance. Forrest sits on a rocking chair with his running shoes on and slowly puts on his Bubba-Gump cap. He stands, walks off the porch, and begins to jog across the lawn, with his speed increasing as he runs farther away. Forrest runs down the driveway away from his house, runs to the end of the drive, turns right, and runs down the highway. Three men sit as they watch the television while Forrest runs through the main street of town, under the sign, and onto the pier. He runs to a pier at the Atlantic Ocean, where a lighthouse stands at the end. Forrest runs across the pier, continues running along the highway, and down a road between fields of wheat, passing a mountain river.",
    "614": "Sidney scurries off excitedly, and back at his apartment, he types on a laptop at his coffee table. Grinning proudly, he scratches his chin and looks down at a pile of magazines on the table. He takes some of Sophie's promotional literature from the pile and regards it with a grimace. It's Chihuahua, as Sophie stares back at him from the page. He dials a number on his cell phone. A van sweeps past the Soho Grand Hotel as Sidney fidgets while trying to get comfortable on a sofa in the spacious white lobby. The cushion he's sitting on slips forward, causing him to sink awkwardly into the crack. A tall, slender woman emerges from a lift to find him struggling with the cushion, his shirt and tank top having ridden up unflatteringly. The woman towers over him, and Sidney's eyes widen as she shrugs. Sidney plonks the fishbowl down on the bar, and she stifles a self-conscious smile. On a TV, Alison's eyes are downcast. Sidney comes back for the fishbowl and heads off. Alison stares down sadly at an untouched glass of White Russian. Meanwhile, Clayton presides over a staff meeting, and Sidney's irked. Sidney scowls as Lawrence basks in the adulation of his colleagues, and Sidney catches up with him outside the meeting. He grins broadly, then heads off before turning back heavy-browed. Sidney screws up his face as Lawrence gives him a jaunty nod and saunters off. Lawrence takes a seat behind his desk to address his underlings. A blonde stripper reveals a penis as Mrs. Harding and her two young daughters look on. Sidney quickly cups Bobbie's dangling penis. A stone-faced receptionist stares at Sidney, who sits outside Clayton's office, obsessively scrubbing his hand with a tissue. The receptionist frowns as Sidney looks in at Eleanor and Clayton, who stand at a desk discussing an A3 mock-up of a potential magazine cover. Eleanor exits and walks uneasily past Sidney, while Clayton looms large in the doorway. Sidney skulks into the office with his head hung low, sits as Clayton paces, and then Clayton is behind Sidney. Clayton walks round to face him, and Sidney looks him in the eye, but Clayton stares coldly. Clayton turns away in his high-backed swivel chair as Sidney lopes out with his tail between his legs. Seated party guests eat under white marquees on the lawn outside Clayton's sprawling mansion. Alison's puzzled as Sidney rises from the table and lets his hand linger on Alison's shoulder before sauntering away. Alison looks behind her, then she too rises from the table. Sidney, dressed in long shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, spots Sophie approaching Lawrence. Sidney joins Lawrence and Sophie and gawks, then lopes off. Sidney spies on them from behind a bush as Lawrence stands with Alison, playfully tossing nuts into his mouth.",
    "151": "He takes out the ticket with a hint of bluster in his attitude, which is cut off by a cold rebuff from the European, leading him to gesture to the back of the train. Gandhi, nonplussed and feeling a little less sure of himself, reacts with a touch of irony. The porter, wanting to avoid trouble, reaches for Gandhi's suitcases, while Gandhi reaches into his waistcoat to produce a card for the conductor, leaving the porter amazed. He then turns and walks out of the compartment. Meanwhile, in a large Victorian parlor in a well-to-do home, Gandhi faces Khan, an impressive Indian, Singh, who is slighter and older but wiry, capable of physical and intellectual strength, and Khan's twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed. Something is said with dignity and strength that makes the statement bewildering, leaving Gandhi looking around helplessly. Mr. Baker, a wealthy white lawyer whose home it is, pokes the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's naivety, while Gandhi holds a British legal document and lifts it pointedly, looking at Mr. Baker in disbelief. Mr. Baker smothers a smile as Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously, who smiles with eyes showing that it's no joke. Gandhi absorbs the inconceivable as his innocence fuses with anger at the injustice of it all. The chilling tone shakes Gandhi's firmness a little, while Khan studies him with wry interest. Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, plainly frightened by the challenge yet determined to take it. A wire basket is placed on supports over the fire. A small crowd of mostly Indian people, with a few curious Whites, gathers in front, where Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd as the English reporter waits skeptically. Nearby, five policemen, including a sergeant and four constables, try to be inconspicuous, with a horse-drawn paddy wagon beside them. Among the crowd are five or six women in saris, featuring Gandhi's wife, Ba, at the front, possessing delicate features and large expressive eyes but feeling ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to act against her wishes. Gandhi wets his lips nervously, glances with apprehension at the police, then takes notes from his pocket and moves to the front of the fire.",
    "767": "Lily wears her winter hat, and the whole family group stares at one another before they form a group hug. Gordon watches from the steps, grasping onto the handrails as they fly over mountains. Jackson and Yuri stand behind the others as the plane approaches to land, while Sasha struggles with the controls to keep the aircraft level. As the plane skims the ground, Jackson and Yuri join the others. In the cargo hold, the two families run to a Bentley, and Jackson unbuckles it, allowing them to climb inside. Gordon heaves a lever, opening the cargo door, then turns and heads for the steps. The plane thumps against the ground, and reaching the cargo hold, Gordon sprints between the rows of cars towards the open rear door. Jackson inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard, turns it, puts the car into gear, and accelerates towards the cargo exit. The car shoots down the ramp and bumps on the glacier. As the plane continues landing, the cars are tossed out of the cargo door. The Bentley's airbags deploy as Sasha gets the plane on the ground. Sasha crosses himself, closes his eyes, and it comes to a stop as he opens his eyes. The plane comes perilously close to the drop. Sasha breathes in then grins, but the grin vanishes from his face as the plane starts to go down a steep incline, rapidly gaining speed, and it falls into an abyss and explodes. Watching from above, Tamara sobs. Jackson looks skywards when he hears a helicopter, seeing a fleet of helicopters carrying wild animals in suspended harnesses. The group on the ground stares, and Gordon starts to wave. The Chinese crewmen on the helicopter see the group below. The helicopter lands, and a man in uniform rushes out to them. Yuri and the twins step forward, but Tamara is stopped. The boys, Yuri, and Popi are on board the helicopter, as the crew gets aboard. The helicopter speeds over mountains as the morning sun throws light on the summits. David and Laura sit together. The helicopters make their way to the complex built deep into the mountains, approaching the bustling landing area. Hearing the corgis, Professor West turns and sees the Queen, struggling with her leads and holding onto her hat. A bus zooms Anheuser and his group through the mountain on an elevated track, passing massive structures with ongoing work on various arks. Yuri is at the R3 Boarding gate while Gordon walks with Tamara, and they all stop when Lily spots light. They run down to a truck on the road, and Jackson lobs a stone at the vanishing truck, which a grandma in the back hears.",
    "553": "The spectacular Grecian facade of the temple is carved directly into the rock, and Indy, Sallah, Henry, and Brody creep forward to see. A Turk stands alone in the center of the Temple, walking slowly. Giant columns define the Temple's perimeter, and they watch him from a safe distance as he is about to approach the spot where a Turkish soldier lies dead, decapitated. The Turk stops just one step away from the beheaded soldier, then takes one more fatal step. Indy, Henry, Brody, and Sallah react to the sight as two Nazi soldiers force another Turk forward, and everyone turns to discover Indy and his party surrounded by Nazi soldiers. Indy's group is relieved of their guns and brought forward by the Nazi soldiers. Indy laughs before Donovan shifts his aim slightly and shoots Henry, with the bullet entering below his ribs, causing Henry to collapse with blood flowing from the wound. Brody and Sallah rush to assist him as Indy spins toward Donovan with murder in his eyes, prompting Donovan to point the gun at him. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of Indy as he walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. Silent reaction shots capture Elsa, Sallah, Brody, and Donovan registering their different emotions as Indy proceeds forward, opening the Grail Diary and taking a few steps before stopping where two men have just died. Indy looks at Henry, then steps forward through the cobwebs, which begin to move, and instinctively rolls forward on the ground out of harm's way. From his new position, he sees the cause of the trouble: a razor-sharp triple pendulum, which has been guarding a small corridor that turns left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn, controlling the spinning blades, and Indy loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades mid-swipe. Brody and Sallah smile, relieved, while Henry shakes his head. Holding the Grail Diary, with his fedora covered in cobwebs, Indy pulls away cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path, each cobble engraved with a letter. Henry lifts his head painfully, still lying in Sallah's arms, as Indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away, causing Indy to fall up to his hip, with his leg stuck through the hole where the stone once was. He grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, with the Grail Diary in his hand.",
    "55": "A small sign in elegant neon scroll gives the name of the place, which sits on rolling green lawns. Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home, its entryway illuminated by streetlights. Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn, offers her his arm, and they go up the walkway to the entrance. They are approached by an unctuous man in his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole, who gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, with torn trousers. He sees Evelyn first, who shakes her head and can't quite conceal her surprise at his question, staring back at Gittes, amused and appalled, but she manages to nod. Gittes locks eyes with Palmer and points to the wall. After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes, who strolls toward the women knitting and working on a quilt. Two of the ladies giggle, while a third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting. Gittes approaches her and looks at the quilt, spotting the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern, with Evelyn beside him. Evelyn gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer, and Gittes looks up to see Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. Mulvihill walks up beside Gittes, and he makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes momentarily. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head, spins him around, and hammers away at him, beating him against the glass door and along the wall, pounding his fists into the cloth until it turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor. Mulvihill's gun clatters to the floor. Gittes jumps in as she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign as she goes. Evelyn drives, looking straight ahead, and after a moment takes one hand off the wheel to rub her left eye a little, as Gittes watches her. Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette and staring off into the night, then turns as Evelyn comes out, carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket. They drink, with Gittes looking sharply at her, and then she looks at him. They're very close now as she goes over a mouse very near his eye. The view shifts to include Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she talks on the phone. Gittes stares at her silently, then she kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, and shuts the door. Gittes stares at the door for a moment.",

Carl holds up his hand expectantly and then nods knowingly. Everyone else claps. He glances around. A spotlight picks Carl out. Carl smiles awkwardly. The audience points at him. Terrance slips off his shoes and sprints down the aisle. He reaches Carl and grabs a chair. He sits facing Carl. Someone gives him a mic. Nick waves. Carl takes a sharp breath. He presses the mic against Carl's nose. Terrance lowers the mic and edges closer to Carl, who inches backwards. He hits Carl with the mic. Carl furrows his brow. Transfixed, Carl stares at him.

Carl jogs along a dark road through the park. Carrying a jerrycan, he reaches a garage. He glances over at the garage shop, which is closed. He saunters over to a pump and swipes a card in it. He takes it out and rubs it on his arm agitatedly. He swipes again. It asks if he wants credit. A scooter careers down the road and turns into the garage. Carl turns to look at the pretty dark-haired woman on the scooter. She gets off and undoes the strap on her blue helmet that has eyes painted on it.",
    "677": "Octavius covers his face while Spider-Man fires more webs. Spider-Man somersaults back, jumps to avoid the mechanical limbs, and limbos under a bridge. With two webs attached to two limbs, Octavius catapults Spider-Man towards a covered walkway. Spider-Man lands on Octavius and knocks him off the roof. Octavius uses one of the limbs to thrust Spider-Man into the train. Spider-Man crashes through a door, stops at the opposite one, spins around two poles, and tangles with Octavius, who struggles through and climbs up to the roof. Spider-Man turns to see why and presses himself to the side of the train to avoid an oncoming one. While it passes, he clambers out of the roof. Spider-Man spots a limb moving under the train and crawls down. The passengers find Spider-Man at one window and Octavius at the one opposite. Octavius punches Spider-Man, who falls onto the street below. Quick webs grab him out of the way of cars and up into the air. Spider-Man swings along beside the elevated track, bounds over high buildings, and flings himself down, shooting a web at Octavius and landing on him. Octavius gains the upper hand by clutching Spider-Man with two of his long metal limbs and smashing him into a train window. Spider-Man flails but manages to stick his feet to the side of the train. Octavius holds Spider-Man tightly in his arms, causing his head to smash through signs on the side of the track. As a train comes the other way, Octavius lets go, and the train hits Spider-Man. He swings gracefully with a long web. Seeing him come, Octavius pulls two passengers from the train and holds them up, tossing a woman at Spider-Man, who swoops down, catches her, and deposits her into a web safety net. Next, Octavius throws the man he's holding, and Spider-Man sweeps up the passenger before he hits the track, then places him in a web mat. Spider-Man punches the driver, and as he lands behind Octavius, a limb pushes a lever, causing the train to pick up speed, sending the passengers whining. Octavius tosses the lever to Spider-Man and leaps off the train. Spider-Man heads for the front, where a further explosion burns his mask, which he peels off. Blinking to clear his eyes, he realizes the train is hurdling through the city towards the end of the line. The unmasked Spider-Man leaps down onto the track, raises himself against the train, and uses his feet to shove against the sleepers in an attempt to decelerate. He jumps back onto the train, clutching his right knee as it continues its relentless surge through the city. Spider-Man leaps anxiously from side to side, then shoots webs right and left.",
    "277": "At this moment, his attention is drawn to something across the way. While Jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the object of his look. He looks up, expectantly. There is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression. Two pretty girls have appeared on the distant roof. They are smiling and talking, although we cannot hear their dialogue. Each wears a terrycloth robe. With their backs to the camera, they take off the robes, slipping them down over their shoulders slowly. Then they spread the robes in front of them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. They at least have all of Jeff's attention. Jeff seems a little disappointed. Jeff's eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood he sees. Jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. Jeff asks, eagerly and alertly. She gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. The camera is now focused on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan. Loud ballet music is pouring from her open window. She begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation. With her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby. The girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg. Jeff's eyes drop from the ballet dancer's room to the one underneath. She looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid. She is a faded, refined type. It is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. At this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing. Jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees. It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music. On the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. We see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen.",
    "120": "Phyllis' shot did hit Neff, and he realizes this as he looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression. He quickly leaves the room the way he came and exits the house, closing the front door with his right hand while his left arm hangs limp. Neff takes a few steps down the walk before hearing someone approaching, prompting him to move behind a nearby palm tree. A man, Zachetti, comes up the steps towards the front door, but Neff calls to him, causing Zachetti to turn and approach slowly. Neff then takes some loose change out of his pocket and tries to drop a nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket, but Zachetti knocks his hand away and just stares at him. Neff attempts again to put the nickel into his pocket, and this time, Zachetti allows him to do so before going slowly past Neff. Neff then grabs Zachetti and pushes him almost violently down the walk, watching as Zachetti goes out of shot and the sound of his steps fades away. Neff then moves through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where his car is parked. Meanwhile, the desk lamp remains lit while the dawn breaks outside the windows. Neff, still clutching the horn of the dictaphone, is very weak, and his voice is filled with exhaustion. He suddenly stops his dictation, sensing he is not alone in the room, and as he turns in his chair, the camera pulls back to reveal the office door wide open. Keyes stands a few steps inside, with the night watchman and the colored janitor peering curiously over Keyes’ shoulder. Keyes slowly, without taking his eyes off Neff's face, reaches back and shuts the door. Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn and looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin, speaking very slowly. Keyes moves a few steps closer, staring at Neff without responding. Neff indicates the used cylinders on the desk, and they stare at each other for a long moment. With immense effort, Neff stands up, swaying slightly, his face covered in sweat and his shoulder bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse but manages to stagger towards the door, holding himself upright with great effort. Upon reaching the door, he twists the knob and drags it open, then turns to look back at Keyes' implacable face.",
    "20": "Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. As they pass Melvin, she does not break stride nor give him notice, though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment-to-moment commentary on her every action. Melvin stops, and she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch. Melvin just looks at her. She exits. The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary as Simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his immediate needs and puts it on, dying a little at every second of silence during the transition; he gestures Vincent to take it down. A beat and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and the scene, gone before we can examine him further, where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress—Vincent's two friends from the street sweep all objects into large sacks—one of them, Doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio. And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club, as the brief savage attack begins. The three attackers leave, and Vincent starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear. A single BARK from VERDELL. A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. Melvin is standing against the wall near his door, and a cop, RAY, is interviewing him. Frank stands upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash, and VERDELL, who is more upset, making pathetic little CRYING. As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell, Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman. A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings. VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches his mugger. Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places Verdell inside. We STAY with the dog during the O.S. VERDELL STOPS—gives Melvin wide berth—slinking along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming. Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it, and exits the room. Ignoring Verdell, he sits at the piano and hits one key repeatedly, his recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick. Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure. Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl with his tail to Melvin. Frank is on the phone. As Jackie enters, he turns toward her. Simon's face is something of a horror, and the sight is a jolt.",
    "1227": "The scene fades to black. In the garden, rain bounces off the abandoned dinner table where droplets plop into half-empty glasses of white wine. A candle flame flickers in a struggle to stay alight. Emily and Tim lie in each other's arms in bed. They caress each other's faces. She stares into his eyes. Tim strokes her arm as he stares into her adoring eyes. Emily plays gently with his ear, then lowers her eyes and lightly touches his lips with her fingertips. Emily stares at him earnestly. Emily looks tearful and puts her lips to his shoulder. A large tear rolls down Emily's nose. Tim hugs her to him. She buries her face in his chest. They kiss. The pulse in Emily's neck jumps rhythmically. Golden light bathes her face as she lies sleeping peacefully. Tim lies beside Emily, watching her closely. Emily's hand rests palm-up on the empty pillow beside her. She twitches slightly but doesn't wake. The scar on the upper part of her left breast shows just above the sheet. Tim, now dressed in his jeans, stands at her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt. Looking troubled, he stares down at Emily. Tim leaves the house by the French windows. He sets off slowly across the dark garden in the pouring rain, then jogs to the picket fence. He jumps over it. Tim runs frantically down a street of shops, some of which have neon-lit signs. Soaked to the skin, Tim bursts into a hospital corridor and strides down it to the nurses' station. The nurse eyes Tim warily. Looking fraught and agitated, Tim turns away from the nurses' station, paces a little and sits down on a chair beside a water cooler. He stares at the floor. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the corridor and walks to meet her. She looks alarmed. Tim raises a hand helplessly, marches back along the corridor and pushes through the double doors. The hospital's main doors slide open. Tim walks out into the night. The rain cascades as a grief-stricken Tim strides away from the hospital. As he walks, he takes his mobile phone from his jeans' pocket and taps in a number. Dan and Michelle lie asleep in each other's arms. Dan reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet. Tim rings off. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the phone to his ear and drops his head. Tim returns to his motel room and pauses in the doorway. His expression is slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own sad thoughts. He turns and stares outside, then closes the door. Tim sits on the edge of his bed, panting. Regaining his composure slightly, Tim reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet and makes a call.",
    "278": "He quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment. Jeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm. He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow. Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. The camera pans down, and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. The camera moves forward, and as it reaches the edge of the window, pans down and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe. The dog turns to glance at her and, apparently taking heed, moves away. Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying. She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face. He is carefully wiping out the interior with a dust cloth. The salesman has his aluminum case on the table near the center of the room. Jeff continues to watch the salesman, his face showing a great concentration of thought. Jeff watching intently. Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, then starts for the door. Jeff swings halfway around in his chair just as Stella reaches the top of the steps. She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door. She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out of the case. She comes down the stairs, brings them to him. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says. As Stella goes out the door, the camera moves in until Jeff's head and the binoculars are filling the screen. He immediately swings to the window and lifts them to his eyes.",
    "215": "The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At length, they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold. An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete, and Everett. As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet. It is indeed Tommy Johnson. Over in the bushes, Everett, Delmar, and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having disposed of the color guard. A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting. The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses. Tommy looks back over his shoulder. Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind. Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. Everett is exposed - in blackface. The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned. Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. Everett, Pete, Tommy, and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues in full cry. When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd. Homer Stokes is mortified. The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence. The only sound is the fluttering flag. Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend. We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague. His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging distance and trajectory. From somewhere, we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping. The flag flutters. The crowd is silent. Big Dan sets and WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together. He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the ground. The crowd cheers. Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers. From somewhere, another BOINK. As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades. His eye tracks up - up - CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.",
    "1301": "Graham stares at his view of the floor, sensing that something is wrong. He then looks at his family huddled on the couch and absorbs the news as he moves to the stairs, taking a seat on the second to last step, partially obscured by the balusters. The words hang in the air as Graham sits quietly, and suddenly all four family members put their hands in the air before lowering them and sitting in silence. Merrill stands and leans against the wall while everyone sits quietly for a moment; he glances at Graham, who turns and looks at Merrill, and they exchange a silent conversation. The sink is piled with pots and pans, as if every utensil and dish in the kitchen had been used, and one side of the dining room is lined with windows that have been boarded up. The table is set, and the Hess family sits around it. Morgan's face is hard, but tears still fall. Graham watches his children cry at the table, then takes big scoops of every dish onto his plate, digs his fork into it, and eats. He swallows and then Merrill furiously nails boards to the children's bedroom door while the master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it, and Graham is in his bedroom. Graham walks to the window, looks out onto his backyard at the crops stretching into the darkness, moves closer to the glass, watches the corn stalks sway with the wind, and backs away toward the middle of the room. He turns to see Merrill with the last board in the hall, moves out, shuts the bedroom door, and Merrill starts hammering the board into the frame. Graham picks up his hammer to join in, glancing to his right at Bo and Morgan standing together at the top of the stairs, Bo holding Morgan's hand. Graham continues hammering as he speaks, then stops while Merrill finishes. Graham smiles at the memory, looks at his daughter, brushes her hair aside as Merrill lifts Morgan, and all four turn to look at the three boarded-up bedroom doors before Merrill puts down Morgan.",
    "1114": "Harry runs down a gloomy brick tunnel, disturbing rats that scuttle from under his feet. Rounding a corner, he finds the tunnel blocked by an iron gate and desperately shakes it, but it is firmly fixed. He turns to see a serpent appearing behind him, blocking the tunnel's tract. Harry backs against the gate as the gigantic mouth of the serpent opens, with dripping poisonous fangs inches from his face. His fingers find a loose piece of stone, and he throws it back along the tunnel. The distracted serpent draws back, withdrawing its head, then glides backwards and makes its way down a different tunnel. Harry follows it cautiously, watching as it slips away and disappears altogether. He breathes a sigh of relief, then quickly runs out of the dank tunnel and back to the main chamber, where he finds Tom Riddle standing next to the unconscious Ginny. Harry kneels beside her, and the serpent rises up behind him. Something glows inside the Sorting Hat—a silver sword. Harry grabs it, waiting as the serpent moves across the stone floor towards him and starts to climb. The serpent uncoils its massive body out of the water, lifting its head towards him. Balancing on an edge, Harry lashes out with the sword, keeping the creature at bay. It smashes its head blindly against the stone carving, and Harry almost loses his grip. As it continues to smash against the stone, chunks of stone fall into the water below, causing Harry to cling with one hand. He regains his footing and climbs higher, standing on the very top of the curved head. Swinging the sword wildly, Harry lands a lucky blow as the serpent aims for the sound of the slashing sword. However, Harry loses balance and drops the sword, making a grab for it as it slips over the curved stone surface. The serpent lunges, and Harry thrusts the sword up towards the loop of its escaping mouth, but a huge poisonous fang breaks off and buries itself in his arm. He quickly pulls it out as the serpent writhes in agony and ultimately crashes lifelessly to the ground. Tom Riddle stares in disbelief at the dead serpent, then looks up and narrows his eyes as Harry staggers towards him, holding the bloody sword in one hand and the poisonous fang in the other. Wincing with pain, Harry clutches the wound on his arm, takes a few steps more, and collapses to the ground after dropping the sword.",
    "1327": "He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north where dark clouds are pushing their way over the distant mountains, signaling a coming storm. Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle at the counter with banana pancakes. Kyle is about to speak to Bob again when Bob's attention is stolen elsewhere. The image flickers on the TV but doesn't improve until Bob gives it a final wallop, and the picture snaps into focus on the stark graphic of the Emergency Broadcasting System, accompanied by its hollow tone, filling the diner. Everyone stops and looks at the TV. Bob switches channels, but they are all the same, leading him to step off the chair and back away as if distance will help. He bumps into Kyle, who hustles past Percy, and Charlie clears dishes at the Anderson's table, while all eyes remain on the TV. Kyle, stewing, picks up the phone to redial, and everyone looks at Howard. Kyle reappears in the diner as Jeep works under a Uhaul's hood outside. An old lady turns to the Andersons as a fly begins to buzz around Gladys's head, smiling strangely. Sandra, unsure of what to make of the response, nods at the old woman as the fly crawls across her cheek without her reacting. Howard and Sandra exchange looks as the door jingles and Jeep enters to have a quiet huddle with Bob, keeping one eye on the old lady near the Andersons. Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys, resting a hand on her belly. A fly lands on the steak, and Charlie tries to wave it away, but another fly lands in its place, causing Charlie to freeze. Kyle glances over from the counter as Charlie shakes her head at Gladys, slaps the check down on the table, and walks to the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob. Gladys begins to innocently laugh as she continues eating her meat while flies swarm suddenly, shocking Sandra and Howard as they wonder how so many got in. Sandra covers her mouth, and everyone's focus shifts to the old lady. Howard gets up, and everybody freaks when he crumbles to the floor. Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over with blood covering her face and chest. Percy reacts first, hurling a heavy metal frying pan from behind the counter that knocks Gladys's head sideways.",
    "478": "Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus and moves slowly into the 'holy of holies,' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball, a discarded wig, a sock, and a buckle - then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart’s desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart’s pen and strokes the feather, touches the inkstand, and stealthily picks them up. Close-up on the pages, then another page - the title page - written in Mozart’s hand. Close-up on Salieri, who stares amazed. They all sit, save Mozart, as the room suddenly looks like a tribunal with all eyes on the Emperor. Joseph nods, and Mozart falls to his knees, giggling. Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro, as Figaro measures the space for his bed on the floor, singing, with Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess’ hat. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno sit with Salieri, and the company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini-Rosenberg, to whom Mozart hands the score from which he is conducting. Mozart then rips out a page, and Bonno watches in terror as he goes on tearing the pages determinedly. A servant opens the door to announce, and Mozart grabs Salieri, kisses his hand, and giggles with relief and gratitude. The Emperor stealthily enters with Von Strack, his finger to his lips, motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg, and Bonno. The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed. The recitativo summons up the march, but instead, there is silence, leaving everyone on stage looking lost, though they attempt to continue the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre as the Emperor finally speaks in a whisper. Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot, and we observe them. Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat and rises to go down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach. Close-up on Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks as he watches the ensemble and listens for a long moment. He bows too, giggling, as Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, bows to the rapturous throng below her, including Salieri. The Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, and Von Swieten are seen applauding, then suddenly close-up on Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls previously seen in Mozart’s apartment. Close-up on Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, with Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm, and Salieri bows his head.",
    "95": "He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse, who shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her. Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes, and the black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his own shoes. Forrest closes his eyes tightly, just as a little boy closes his eyes tightly; it is young Forrest as he sits in a doctor's office. Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg braces, and the doctor sets Forrest down on his feet. Forrest walks around stiffly as his mother, Mrs. Gump, watches him clank around the room awkwardly. Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump, and a loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls. Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street with Forrest walking stiffly next to his mother. A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest turns into live action as the General dons a hooded sheet over his head and is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse. The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan members dressed in full uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street, and Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck, caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and tries to free Forrest while two old cronies sit in front of a barber shop and watch. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men, with Mrs. Gump holding tightly onto Forrest's hand, and they walk along a dirt road where a row of mailboxes stands to the left before walking along the Gump Boarding House driveway. Mrs. Gump leads Forrest to the porch and bends down to look him in the eye. The principal sighs and then stands up as Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits. The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump while Forrest, sitting left, listens and sits outside the principal's office. Loud organic male grunts are heard coming from inside the house as Forrest sits on a swing outside. Forrest sits on the swing as the grunts continue, and the principal steps out of the Gump House, wiping sweat from his face. Forrest is sitting on the porch, and the principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back at Forrest, who grunts, imitating him. Embarrassed, the principal turns and walks away. Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up, as a cab driver closes the trunk of the car while two women walk toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch, and a man with a cane steps to the left across the hall.",
    "989": "Benjamin turns the ship's wheel while Mike grips a cigar between his teeth. Grinning, Mike takes the helm and sharply steers the boat left. Later, Mike and Benjamin stand at the bar in a shady watering hole, where Mike sips his liquor. He removes his shirt to reveal tattoos over his torso, strikes a boxing pose showing off the tattoos, and kisses his tattooed bicep. Mike grins at Benjamin just as a bevy of prostitutes gathers on the stairs, and a beautiful woman steps forward. They climb the stairs, and the woman emerges wearily from beneath the rapidly moving covers under the sheets, after which he leaves. Benjamin then trots down the stairs and out through the back door, past two scantily clad hookers, disappearing into a crowded back alley. His father, Thomas, leaves a hooker outside an adjacent building and spots Benjamin. Thomas's motorcar pulls up beside Benjamin as he strolls down a rain-washed street. Thomas, sporting a neat mustache, opens a door to Benjamin, who climbs in, and the car pulls away as Thomas turns to regard his son and smiles. A waiter addresses them while Thomas and Benjamin sit at a table. Two whiskeys are served, and Thomas looks away as they clink glasses, smiling wryly as Benjamin sputters on the whiskey. Later, as the bar staff are clearing up, Thomas raises his glass, coughs his whiskey, and grimaces, while Benjamin slugs his whiskey. Thomas then delivers Benjamin to his front gate, where he raises his fedora and teeters towards the front door. Benjamin staggers through the darkened hallway, where Queenie stands with her arms folded, and he spasms and vomits. Daisy, now about nine years old, is woken very early by Benjamin tiptoeing into her room. She nods, joins Benjamin outside in the early morning light, and Benjamin sprints on ahead of Daisy. They arrive at Captain Mike's tugboat, where the tattooed mariner lies in a deep, alcohol-induced slumber. Mike eventually comes round, and Benjamin shakes his head while Mike eyes Daisy. Mike rubs his bare, tattooed chest, sits up, and shoves a cigar in his mouth as the tug makes its way along the river through thick fog. Benjamin and Daisy stand at the prow, looking out, and Benjamin, wearing a woolen hat, glances back at Daisy. In the wheelhouse, Mike sips coffee from an enamel mug, peers through the window, and sees an ocean liner passing the other way. Daisy and Benjamin climb the steps up to the wheelhouse, Daisy waves to the larger vessel, and she and Benjamin share a smile. In the hospital, Caroline turns to Daisy, who stares towards the window as lightning flashes outside. Caroline sits down with the diary and reads. Benjamin stares at himself in the mirror, then at Mrs. Maple, who sits motionless in a chair with her head resting against the seat back, her eyes dull and her mouth slightly open.",

Yule Mae picks up the plates. With a supercilious smile, Hilly picks up her paper. Chubby-faced Sugar who towers above Minnie listens obediently. Sugar gets on the bus leaving Minnie behind.

    "384": "The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. His wallet is tossed onto the desk. The chief leans forward, takes the wallet, and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity, looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card. The Dude stares. The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude, hitting him in the forehead with a thud, and the scalding coffee splashes everywhere. The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk. He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts kicking at him. The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump, is gingerly touching sore spots on his face and scalp. The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap, is visible. The place is a wreck. Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped. Quiet ensues. Maude emerges from the bedroom wearing a bathrobe. She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches, and the Dude is stupefied. A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint. He climbs out of bed, but Maude remains in it. She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap, pulling her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised. He picks a White Russian off the bedside table and spits some. The Dude is staring off into space, thinking. The Dude is leaving the bedroom. The man nervously complies, and the Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit, is bald with a short fringe, and has a mustache. The Dude shouts to cover his fear and is stunned as he fumbles in his wallet. The Dude looks at the picture, which is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. He is holding out another picture of a bleak farmhouse and silo, the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape, and hands back the picture. The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. Four people sit at a booth: Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age.

    "678": "Spider-Man attaches two webs to buildings on either side of the track, but the web breaks, causing him to fall forward. As the train hurtles towards the river, Spider-Man fires webs at buildings, and a block of web shoots out. Spider-Man takes the strain, and although it rips his costume in several places, he uses the webs to restrain the train's forward thrust. His features are contorted as some of the webs start to break. The train approaches the buffers, crashes through them, and careens forward to the edge, with the first carriage teetering over. Spider-Man stands glued to the front, holding the webs attached to the buildings. The train grinds to a halt, and Spider-Man's eyes close as he releases the web and slumps forward. Hands prevent him from falling, and the passengers lift the unconscious, unmasked Spider-Man into the carriage. His head falls back as he's passed along over people's heads until he's gently lowered to the floor. His face visible, the passengers stare at him. As the kid's eyes open and his gloved hands touch his face, a worried look shows as he realizes he is without a mask. He sits up as a passenger crouches down, looks around, and two boys step forward. The younger one stretches out his hand with Spider-Man's mask, which Peter takes. Through tear-filled eyes, Peter gazes at the boys, then lowers his head, and slips on the mask to become Spider-Man again. He sits up straight, struggles to rise, and is helped to his feet by more hands that steady him. The door behind Spider-Man clatters in as Octavius climbs on board, facing him. A passenger steps forward, followed by others who step between Spider-Man and Octavius. Octavius simply smiles and sweeps them aside using two of his limbs, leaving a clear path to Spider-Man. Spider-Man gestures to those around him and staggers forward, but a punch from a mechanical limb sends him to the floor, where he lies helpless. Meanwhile, an electric storm hovers over the Osborn home, and inside, Harry drinks. He turns to see Octavius holding Spider-Man above his head. Harry points to the couch, where he had seen Spider-Man stand over his dead father, and Octavius lays the bound figure down.",

And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we. It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. Pull back to reveal Max and Valerie, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and Fezzik stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. Inigo accepts the pill as Fezzik takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. During this, Fezzik, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right-angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. Inigo and Fezzik react. Westley is the only one not amazed. He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy. He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now. Fezzik helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. Westley, absolutely stunned. He shakes his head from side to side. Inigo and Fezzik do. They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these words come to us on the wind. Buttercup, in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. Buttercup, and she couldn't seem more serene. Westley and Inigo and Fezzik, looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and Fezzik shake hands. Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. The most intelligent-looking, the most impressive appearing clergyman imaginable. Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old King and Queen. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. Four guards are in position flanking the chapel door. He has an impediment that would stop a clock. The Brutes and Yellin, by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. And it is a bit unnerving--a giant seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. And he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. Yellin, keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold.",

Bert points to Eddie and snaps his fingers, pretending to forget Findley's name; he nods to them all and leaves. Sarah gives Bert a look. The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring out a bouncy tune to find Sarah descending the stairs, looking on at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down the steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and exchanges her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-like descent as she moves slowly, dreamily past the combo, past Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress, and past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; she continues past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her side, leans over, and whispers something in her ear. Her face hardens, and angrily she turns and throws her champagne in his face and smashes her glass on the floor. She starts to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the shoulders. The music stops, and the dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd, tries to take her in his arms, but she beats on his chest, sobbing, unable to make words. Eddie drags her limp, trembling body across the dance floor to the stairs while Bert watches them go, wiping the champagne off his coat lapels. The music starts up again. A Negro maid sits patiently in the room, watching over Sarah and the coats that Sarah is lying on. A woman enters and, disgusted, pushes Sarah off her fur coat. Eddie appears in the doorway, and the woman takes her coat and leaves. Eddie looks at Sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out. Findley, drink and cork-tipped cigarette in hand, escorts Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his game room. It is a beautifully appointed salon, wood-paneled, filled with plush divans and decorated with terra cotta Roman statuary. In the center of the room is the billiard table, now covered by a cloth. Findley goes to the bar, Eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth that covers the table, but it's not a pool table -- it's a billiard table. Eddie finishes uncovering the table.",
    "996": "Myrtle lands dead in the road with a gash in her chest, and Daisy and Gatsby drive on. The other driver gets out and stares at the scene, while the eyes on the ragged billboard for the oculist, Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, stare blankly in the darkness. Tom drives up with Nick and Jordan, and later, police have arrived. They get out and walk towards Wilson's garage, where a crowd has gathered. Tom sees a bereft Wilson and frowns with concern as policemen hold the crowd back. One of them lays a sheet over Myrtle's body, which lies on a table, and Tom steps closer. He reaches out and pulls the sheet back, revealing Myrtle's blood-spattered corpse, gasping as Nick removes his cap. Tom just stares and holds his hand up to the cop, tearfully shaking his head and looking at Nick. Tom stands with his head bowed, restrains Wilson, and an old cop frowns dubiously before walking away. Wilson sits looking dazed, and Tom sits facing him, handing him a drink. Tom stares at him, and with tears rolling down his face, Wilson drinks and presses the glass against his face. Tom touches Wilson's face and lets Wilson rest his head against his shoulder, rubbing his back comfortingly. Nick covers Myrtle's body with the sheet, and Tom drives away with Jordan as they stare ahead, the shiny blue coupe heading down the dark road. They arrive at the Buchanan mansion, where servants come out, and Tom walks up to open the front door. Nick and Jordan stand on the porch as Tom studies Nick, who stares back, frowning. With a dismissive glance, Tom goes inside, and Nick glares at Jordan, who, shocked, marches into the house. Looking deeply troubled, his brow pinched, Nick turns and walks off and looks around incredulously, walking over to Gatsby, who's hiding behind a bush. Gatsby's face is suddenly bathed in light as lights come on in the house and the butler, Henri, comes out onto the porch, looks around but doesn't see anyone, and goes back inside. Nick stares at Gatsby gravely, and Gatsby glances up at the lights in the upstairs windows, then back at Nick. There is a flashback of Gatsby grabbing the wheel, and Gatsby and Daisy watch in horror as Myrtle slams against the windscreen and hurtles through the air. Daisy is in the driving seat. Recounting events, Gatsby looks distraught as Nick stares at him, wide-eyed. Gatsby turns away and sits, resting his face against his hand. Nick nods sharply and attempts a smile, surreptitiously walking around to the terrace, where he sees Tom and Daisy sitting at the dining table, talking. Daisy sits looking dazed as Tom moves closer and puts his arm around her.",
    "735": "He pulls Rose up. Three nearby sailors turn and run toward Jack. Rose grips the railing with her free hand as Jack holds her up and onto the poop deck as Jack wraps his arms around Rose's torso and lifts her back over the rail. Jack falls on top of Rose as she is spilled onto the deck. The sailors run up to them. One sailor glances at Jack and then at Rose's torn dress. Jack stands and places his hands into his trouser pockets. Later, Rose is wrapped in a blanket as men handcuffed Jack. Jack glances at wide-eyed Rose. Cal rubs Rose's arms. Cal strides back to Jack. Rose glances at Jack before leaving with Cal. Jack motions over Cal's brown-haired manservant. He steps up to Jack and holds out a cigarette case. Jack takes two cigarettes, placing one in his mouth and the other behind his left ear. Jack looks down at his unlaced boots. Jack looks down as the man walks off. In her berth, Rose sits at a vanity table and holds her silver hand mirror. She sets down the mirror as Cal opens the door. Cal opens a box containing the heart of the ocean. He fastens the necklace with a blue heart-shaped diamond on Rose. Rose strokes the necklace as she gazes at her own reflection on the vanity mirror. Cal kneels beside Rose. She stares at him. Cal smiles at the blank-faced Rose who blinks then turns and stares at her reflection. She places her right hand over the diamond. Daytime, Jack and Rose walk along in the upper deck. Rose holds out her engagement ring. Rose shakes Jack's hand up and down. She releases his hand and walks away. She stares at him with her mouth open. She snatches Jack's sketchbook. Jack sits beside Rose as she flips through his drawings. She studies a sketch of a woman breastfeeding an infant. She turns to a drawing of a nude woman lying on her side with a cigarette in her mouth. Another sketch depicts a nude woman standing against a ballet bar. Rose closes the sketchbook as another passenger walks past. Smiling, Rose turns to his sketch of a nude dark-haired woman lying with one arm stretched over her head. Another drawing of just a pair of hands. Rose looks down open-mouthed as Jack flips to another drawing. A fully-clothed middle-aged woman. Rose smiles at Jack. Her smile fades. In a dining room, Ruth sips tea with two other women. Ruth nods at Molly then strides off. Nearby mustached Ismay sits with the captain. Jack takes Rose's hand. He pulled her to a different section of the railing. Jack spits.",
    "773": "He reports into a walkie-talkie on the activity by the basin as Long-hair Charlie scarfs a pickle. Jackson sits in the passenger seat of an army jeep, the kids in the back, while soldiers crouch behind him. They arrive at a busy research facility where Jackson smooths back his black hair. In an office with Professor West, Adrienne talks to Satnam via the Internet and observes the great expression worn by Satnam and West. Mouth agape, Adrienne straightens away from the computer screen, then wide-eyed, she frowns while looking out the window and spotting Jackson knocking about with Lily and Noah. She watches as Jackson lifts up Lily and looks around furtively at West, who sits behind him. Satnam disconnects and turns to his wife Aponna, kneeling by his son, Ajeet. At Yellowstone, Charlie spies on Jackson and the kids as night falls. Adrienne climbs on board a helicopter, while in his darkened office at the White House, Anheuser hangs up the phone and looks out of the French windows. At the campsite in Yellowstone, Jackson watches the chopper fly overhead, bringing up Google Maps on his laptop to show Yellowstone. In the tent, Noah swats a bug, but Jackson spots him sending a text on a cell phone and takes it from him. Noah zips the door closed on Jackson, who sits back and reads the text. Jackson sits in his limo, typing on his laptop when he spots Charlie nearby broadcasting from an RV. Newspaper clippings surround Charlie, who has a beard darker than his long, straggly hair and looks around furtively, then leans in close. Jackson frowns dubiously, then nods calmly. Meanwhile, Gordon hugs Kate in a supermarket, and she smirks as a crack appears in the car park outside, rumbling beneath a car and approaching another. As it spreads in the supermarket, he finds something nearby and hands it to her at the checkout, where a customer's trolley rolls slowly away, and a crack appears on the floor. Cereal boxes shake as Kate reaches out for them, and a large crack tears through the floor between them. At Yellowstone, Lily scratches, and Noah looks gravely at Jackson. Anheuser follows Wilson into the White House situation room, while a well-dressed, middle-aged man approaches the boxer's corner of the ring as the fight begins. Sitting by a glamorous, young, blonde Tamara, Uri looks at his mobile and presses his thumb to the screen to confirm his identity. Uri looks up blankly, stands up, and leaves the arena, checking his watch as he goes, while Tamara stands and calls after him. Sultan spots Uri leaving, a massive hit on Sultan, and he runs to the canvas. Jackson drives the kids in the limo as they fall asleep in the back seat.",
    "836": "Diana plugs a flash drive into the credit card burner. On the records computer, Sandy logs into the network and opens the folder. In his office area, Ken stares off with a furrowed brow before sitting at his computer and logging into company records. Diana enters Cornish's information into a card burner and inserts a blank card. On Ken's computer, he sees Cornish's actual photo and quickly stands. The burner finishes processing and prints out the card, which Diana hands to Sandy, who eyes it. Ken swiftly moves through the offices, approaches the records room doors, inputs the code, and they slide open. As he quickly enters, Ken finds the room vacant and steps toward the computer with wide eyes. Meanwhile, Sandy and Diana exit the building through an unmarked alley door. Diana grabs the card, and they enter an upscale hotel lobby, approaching reception. In their silver sedan, Julian and Marisol speed across a bridge into St. Louis. As Diana follows Sandy into the luxury suite, her mouth falls open, and she grabs a grape from a fruit platter. Loosening his tie, Sandy enters a room, removes his suit coat, tosses it onto a chair, and flops back on the bed. In a frothy bubble bath, Diana blows a handful of suds, finishes off a large bottle of champagne, and lowers the gushing shower head beneath the frothy surface while Sandy sleeps in the same outstretched position. She slaps the side of the tub, and her foot jolts out of the water. Meanwhile, Trish speaks on her phone as Diana enters in a robe. In a salon, Diana gently applies lavender eye makeup to her eyelids. Three stylists watch as she moves around the sampling table, grabs a can of hair spray, shakes it, sniffs it, and sprays her hair. Leaning back and forth, Diana douses her entire mop of hair, shakes it around, and faces the mirror, surrounding her head in a cloud of hairspray. Looking up, she spots the giggling stylists who abruptly stop and look away. Diana blinks rapidly, shifts in place, turns toward the checkout counter with an armful of products, strides forward, stops, lowers her gaze, slowly turns around, and approaches the stylists with her lips pressed together. A male stylist steps forward, and Diana sits down as he spins her toward the mirror. In the swanky hotel restaurant, Sandy slouches alone at the bar with a glass of water, sits up, glances around, and takes a sip. Wearing a chic black dress, Diana rounds the corner in slow motion, stepping forward with her auburn hair straightened and makeup beautifully applied.",
    "260": "Hi is shaking his head while Gale chuckles, and Hi continues to shake his head as the camera moves closer to show Hi staring glumly at Gale. A motorcycle's rear wheel and fender with twin exhaust pipes are visible, with flames in each pipe as the bike roars. We see from behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night, creeping in toward a window with a feeble yellow light. Hi, composing a letter in voice-over, is hunched over the kitchen table writing, illuminated by a yellow lamp, the only light in the trailer. We creep in on Gale and Evelle sprawled on the sofa and easy chair, on a pimply-faced Cashier asleep behind the counter with a dirty magazine lying open on his chest, on Nathan Jr. asleep in an ottoman armchair in the living room, lit by the TV snow, a half-full glass of milk beside him, his robe disheveled, and eyeglasses slid down his nose, on Ed and Nathan Jr. asleep together in the double bed with Ed's arm draped protectively over the infant. The rumble of the motorcycle starts up again as we see the night sky, and the motorcycle tire enters the frame as it halts, the Biker planting a jackbooted foot while the engine rumbles. We crane up over the Biker's back to reveal his view of a bluff overlooking the trailer park with a glowing yellow light in one trailer window below. The biker sits motionless, legs outstretched against his parked motorcycle, staring at the campfire as we float closer to his face and realize something peculiar: his unblinkingly open eyes show only fire, either a reflection or something burning inside. A jackbooted foot grinds it out, leading into the showroom as the Biker's mail-and-chained fist pushes the door open, jackboots strolling through a showroom of unpainted furniture and fixtures, while the Biker's hand produces a fresh cheroot from nowhere, either sleight-of-hand or magic.",
    "1199": "As rain lashes the house, Marley jumps up at a window while more lightning flashes. John arrives at the airport in the pouring rain, and Jenny comes out of the terminal sheltering under a newspaper. The rain has stopped as they pull into the drive in the old hatchback, and Jenny's holding a stuffed alligator. With the alligator under her left arm, she hauls open the garage door and stares at a scene of devastation. Marley spots some pigeons and struggles away from two bikini girls. The birds scatter, and he hops down the beach full of sunbathers, running along the shoreline with John in pursuit. Marley runs straight into the arms of a guy, whose dog hurtles to his side. Later, they're back at the house, and with one of Jenny's bras in his mouth, Marley charges again, bursts through the screen door, and out into the garden. He bolts over the back fence as the Grogans give chase, passing a neighbor cooking at a barbecue, who nods. An older Marley drags Jenny through a hedge, and she lands in front of another dog owner. John's glumly making notes and screwing them up again. Jenny, with Marley, joins the other trainers, and Marley leaps up, wags his tail, then jumps up at John and tries to run off again. A woman walks off with arrogant confidence, and he sprints away as the trainer reaches for a whistle. Dog stops, turns, looks at her, then bounds happily back. Marley knocks the trainer over and starts humping her leg as John and Jenny rush to help. John stares at Jenny, then shakes his head. Marley lolls out of the window, ears flapping in the breeze as John clutches his hindquarters. The dog's out of the window, walking on his front paws, as Jenny gets out to help while traffic streams past. Arnie reads John's copy and shakes his head, with glasses perched on his nose and his face screwed up. John leaves the glass-fronted office with a grin, walks through the open-plan newsroom with fists clenched in triumph, and sits at his cube workstation to start typing on his computer. Marley spots another dog, pairs off with the table, and with paws on Jenny's shoulders, licks her face. He smiles. John, Jenny, and Marley are at the dog beach; it's a tough one, and he grimaces, while grinning, she pats him sympathetically on the back. They tumble, fully clothed, onto their bed, kissing and rolling around, as John picks up a pillow and dumps it on the dog's head. Arnie hands John back some copy, and John rummages for his phone. Back home, John lets Marley off the leash and sits on the bed. He feigns enthusiasm as she goes back into the bathroom; John composes himself, then she makes another entrance.",
    "1338": "The pimp joins the captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates like a twisted wedding ceremony. Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel. Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship. We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter, then Fantine lays down. CLOSE ON a man's hand leaving money. MOVE TO FIND Fantine lying alone on the mattress. She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money. She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-dressed young man, Bamatabois, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet. Javert is quietly coldly furious. He shows the blood. Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. Valjean steps out of the shadows. Javert turns to Fantine. Javert's assistants pick Fantine up. Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream. Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches out a hand to Fantine. He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face. Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms. As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them, then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them. As Javert walks up the steps to his police station, his assistant stops him with an urgent letter. Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a terrible mistake. Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone when Javert enters and stands before him. Valjean conceals his shock. He looks up. Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks. Valjean is furiously packing stuff up. The driver is Valjean, hesitating. Close on two horses panting. Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the courtroom. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the doors open and Valjean bursts in. The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-out, stands before the judge. He looks uncannily like the real Valjean. Sensation in the court.",
    "939": "Watson watches as Moriarty heads off. The photographer. Holmes is outside on a balcony, drinking from a hip flask. The rocking back fall stumble into the darkness nearby. Moriarty comes out and joins him. Moriarty goes to a table and picks up a chess timing clock. He puts the clock on another table beside a chessboard. Holmes takes a seat in front of the board. Moriarty fetches a blanket and puts it around Holmes' shoulders. Moriarty picks up a second blanket and drapes it around his own shoulders. Holmes and Moriarty both smile. Then Moriarty's expression hardens. He starts by moving a white pawn. He sets the time clock. Inside, Watson and Sim move amongst the guests. Outside on the balcony, Holmes advances a second black pawn on the game of chess. Inside, Watson and Sim meet up again. They look over at the delegates. Holmes' knight takes one of Moriarty's pawns. Moriarty advances a bishop. A man smokes a cigar. Sim studies the faces of the potential assassins. A hyperemic needle is concealed inside an especially-adapted Winchester cartridge case. Watson glances around the photographer about to take the delegates' photo. Watson deliberately knocks a tray of drinks out of a footman's hands. As it crashes onto the marble floor, everyone looks around in surprise except one man in the corner. Watson peers at the man's hairline and notes that he drops his cigar. Sim stares at the man as he steps away from the delegate he was talking to. She looks over at Watson, who nods. The man reaches inside his jacket with his left hand just as Sim steps up to him. Another man continues assembling the hyperemic cartridge. He shoves her aside and draws a gun. Watson tackles him as he takes a shot. Mycroft steps forward and his arms ready. Soldiers drag him away. The hyperemic cartridge is loaded into a weapon. As Rene is dragged away, Moran surreptitiously shoots him with a hyperemic cartridge fired from a gun hidden in his cane. Something occurs to Watson. He runs out of the ballroom and joins the soldiers guarding Rene. He's collapsed. The soldiers allowed him to tend to Rene who's convulsing on the floor. Watson quickly finds a hyperemic dart lodged in Rene's leg. He pulls it out and tastes the compound it's injected. Moran watches with a smile. Sim runs to Rene. Watson spots Moran leaving. He turns back to Rene who's fading fast. On the balcony. Holmes looks troubled. Unsettled, Holmes sits back in his chair. Moriarty shrugs the blanket off her shoulders and gets up on the table. Holmes removes his blanket and looks at the chessboard. Moriarty feels for his notebook and runs his thumb over the top line in his pocket.",
    "954": "A crash occurs, with the object hitting the Earth some distance away, producing noises from inside the damaged carriage as if an angry beast is trapped. On the remains of the platform, the Cinay camera runs out of film, while the largely intact yellow Coupe remains amid the devastation. Joe navigates past the car in search of the others, climbing onto twisted railway tracks where he sees Preston and gives a thumbs up. Joe notices a blood stain and walks toward it, with the others gathering around. Alice appears behind them, prompting a smile from Joe, who then turns back to the wreckage, retrieves his makeup box, and quickly pockets a locket Alice notices. He picks up a strange white cube from the wreckage before joining the others on top of a wrecked carriage, offering a view across the devastation. Joe points to the mangled remains of a white pickup truck. They descend from the carriage and approach the pickup, where a man sits unresponsive. Alice touches his limp arm, causing a document to spill from his hand, which she picks up and opens as the boys crowd around. It's a map that Dr. Woodward seizes, sitting up stiffly and looking around at the kids before pulling out a revolver as people approach. The kids flee, with Alice running to the Coupe, and the boys collecting their belongings, including the camera, before scrambling into the car. Alice drives them away as numerous soldiers arrive, brandishing guns and torches, with one soldier picking up a discarded Super 8 film box and pondering it. Back in town, the boys exit the car as Alice hands Joe the white cube he retrieved from the crash site. With faces grimed from explosions, Alice and Joe regard each other briefly before Alice drives away in the Coupe, watched by Joe and the others. At home, Joe sits in the bath, holding the knobbly-surfaced white cube, staring thoughtfully into the distance as the town's lights twinkle in the darkness from a hillside view. The next morning, Joe is seen sleeping in bed and later puts out dog food before running to the Kaznyk's house, script in hand, to join Charles, who is watching TV.",
    "963": "He holds her for another moment, then pulls away and glances at her. He forces a faint smile. Elise gives him a tender look. He turns away, and she watches him with concerned eyes. As he trudges out of the emergency room, a discouraged expression crosses her face. Exiting the ER, David walks down a corridor, his pained eyes staring straight ahead. A view from behind shows his lone form filing down the long hospital hallway. Now in a vast hallway lined with marble, Richardson joins Harry at a window overlooking New York City. Harry's gaze stays trained ahead. Meanwhile, Elise sits alone in the hospital waiting room. She blinks back tears, then shakes her head. Now a friend pushes Elise in a wheelchair. They head out. Harry gives him a skeptical look. Richardson puts on his fedora, gives Harry a pat on the arm, and walks off, leaving the younger officer alone at the window of the mid-century high-rise. Eleven months later, now on a sunny farm, David walks a green pasture. Later, in front of a barn and silos, he addresses a crowd. Sitting in a campaign bus, Charlie and an aide watch a news report on the vehicle's TV. Charlie heads outside. As David greets his supporters, the campaign chairman sits on a picnic table and reads a newspaper. He browses a page, folds it up, and frowns thoughtfully to himself. As voters disperse, David joins him. Charlie holds out the newspaper. An arts section feature shows photos of Elise, one dancing, the other with a bow. David stares at the photo, his brow cinched. As he leaves, Charlie gazes after him with pursed lips. Seated outside a waterfront warehouse, he wears a sober frown. Now under a dusky sky, David walks across a deserted shipping dock. He carelessly tracks his feet through a large glassy puddle and stops at the dock's edge, gazing toward the low sun. In her apartment, Elise sits at the foot of her bed, eyeing a document. She sets it aside, then lifts her troubled gaze. Now David approaches the ragged bar. As David disappears inside, Harry emerges from a neighboring door. Inside, David sits forlornly at the bar. The bartender hands him a slip of paper. David stares after her, then reads the note. At dusk, under pouring rain, he holds his jacket over his head as he runs along a dock to a warehouse. In the evening, he leans on the wall, waiting. Harry arrives in a fedora and trench coat, sheltered from the rain by an umbrella. He joins David. Harry lowers his gaze and takes a deep breath. He gives a grave shake of the head, then takes a seat on a stack of shipping pallets.",
    "1295": "Bo finally looks at her father and smiles softly. Graham looks in the direction of the boy's voice while Merill picks up Bo and rushes through the crops, finding Morgan standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms. Merill puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of Morgan, who looks deep in thought. Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin, turning his face so he's looking straight at him, and Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer. Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his face, forcing Graham to look to his right, where he sees something. Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet and starts moving forward towards something, walking through a thin layer of crops and emerging in a clearing. Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center, with Merrill, Bo, and Morgan following him. Two German Shepherds are running back and forth, clearly agitated. Graham turns off the phone, realizing his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds, and there is a large puddle on the kitchen tiles. Graham looks at the majestic dog, shivering, as Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. A police officer stands on the other side of the screen door, and Officer Edgar Paski nods that he knows, with Graham staring at him. Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill, places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, and walks over to Houdini. Bo is about to pour a glass of water into the dog bowl, moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table, and takes a tiny sip of the water first. She stops, holds the glass out to Morgan, who drinks. The two children sit down in the grass with the dog as Bo shrugs and pours the water into the bowl. Houdini just sits staring at them, not shivering, but unnaturally still, as Bo pushes the bowl closer. Houdini begins to growl, making the children turn white, and Bo stands up as Houdini crouches down, trembling, his body tightening as he's about to leap. Officer Paski stands up, turns back, and stares in the direction of the house. Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard, stopping cold when they look in his direction. They begin a slow walk towards him, with Morgan Hess seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.",

Octavius' limbs grab Spider-Man's head and toss him about, causing both men to fall out of the window. The material of Aunt May's brolly starts to tear, and she slips down on it as Octavius tosses Spider-Man across the street into a window in the block opposite. Aunt May slips further down the brolly, but her feet land on a ledge. She looks way down to the ground, then up at the face of the statue whose outstretched arms she's hooked her brolly around, before she's lifted off the ledge. Spider-Man sticks two webs to the window frames and stretches them back like a catapult. As he launches himself through the air, a pincer on one of Octavius' limbs becomes a pointed spear. Octavius stretches out the spear-like limb towards Spider-Man, but Aunt May smacks Octavius on the head with her brolly. Spider-Man grabs the limb, and Octavius releases Aunt May. Spider-Man dives to her rescue, catches her, and they swoop and swing down the street. The police fire at Octavius, who, with bags of money in one pincer, disappears around the corner of the building. Spider-Man lands with Aunt May, cocks his head, then leaps up on a web. Girls flock to Aunt May, while firing webs as he goes, Spider-Man sweeps through the skies from building to building across New York City. The planetarium with its suspended glass curtain wall stands 95 feet high, and inside it is a sphere constructed of fabricated aluminum panels. Peter is in the crowded planetarium and reaches for food as someone grabs the last canope from a waitress's tray. A couple walks by, and he raises his camera, realizing the lens cap is still on and removes it, but by which time, the couple has walked away. Harry's poured a drink, snatching the bottle and knocking over his glass as Peter walks up to him. The two old friends stare defiantly at each other as the Mayor glares. All heads turn to look at the stairway down into the planetarium where Captain Jameson is in uniform, accompanied by a young lady walking beside him arm-in-arm. Everyone applauds, except Peter, who sees the young lady is MJ in a black strapless dress, her hair tied up. MJ stares at Peter and turns her head away as he gazes, mesmerized. Later, Peter makes his way out onto the balcony, where a server has a tray with one canope on it. He reaches for it as someone else whisks it away. Peter sees MJ alone, pauses, then walks up behind her. MJ turns to face him, and Peter gulps, his eyes filling up. He watches forlornly as MJ strides away from him, and a waitress passes by as Peter grabs a cocktail glass.",
    "135": "He is chairing the Congress, and Jinnah bows, takes his notes, and gestures to the auditorium—a man made for and loving the spotlight. At last, he moves back to his place on the platform, where Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation, and others crowd around him. Fleetingly, on the edge of the picture, we see Gandhi, the only one in an Indian tunic, sitting at the end of the second row on the platform, just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah. Patel approaches the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands, and the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. He raises his hands again, stilling them, as Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. Gandhi is greeted with mild applause because the convention is performing like one now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it, and Gandhi nods to him, acknowledging the residue of applause. Patel wanders back toward the others, his mind already on them, but he half-hears Gandhi's comment and turns with a smile, demonstrating a politician's flexibility. Gandhi grins and takes glasses from his sleeve—this is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of paper with notes which he puts on the podium. He puts his glasses on and faces the convention, while on the platform, whispered politics continue, and on the convention floor, some listen as others talk of different things. Nehru, having caught Gandhi's last remark, turns, and now attention begins to focus on the floor of the hall too. Jinnah listens aloofly and challengingly, then takes off his glasses, folds them, and in silence, starts back toward his place on the platform as a cameraman flashes a picture, prompting tepid applause taken up here and there. On the platform, leaders join in perfunctorily as we see one peasant face, Shukla, who we will come to know, watching from the crowd of outsiders in the doorways. Nehru, who has been observing Gandhi with interest and some surprise, turns to Patel. An open touring car struggles along a bumpy trail with Nehru driving, accompanied by four friends as young as he, all dressed in the same expensive, British manner. Nehru looks a little harassed from the ragging and the rough ride. The ashram is half-finished, with unworked ground and partially completed buildings, looking like a primitive frontier outpost. They are finally brought to a halt by a goat tethered right across the path.",
    "2": "The wind carries something in a circle, sometimes violently or soaring skyward, before letting it float to the ground. Jane and Ricky sit on the bed watching his wide-screen TV. Jane watches Ricky and then takes his hand. He scans her eyes, curious about her reaction, and she kisses him softly. Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating voraciously and drinking beer, while Carolyn watches him with contempt. Jane stares at her parents, apprehensive. Jane obeys, surprised by his voice's power. Lester gets a plate of asparagus, serves himself, and then hurls it against the wall, frightening Carolyn and Jane, but continues eating as if nothing happened. Jane stares at her plate. She sits on her bed, hears a knock, rolls her eyes, and lets Carolyn in. Carolyn stares at Jane, starts crying, slaps her hard, and leaves embarrassed. Jane looks in the mirror, rubs her cheek, crosses to the window, and looks out. Across from Ricky's room, Ricky stands at the window with his digicam, videotaping her. Behind Ricky, he videotapes Jane, who waves, then starts to take off her shirt until she is in her bra. She clumsily takes off her bra as we zoom in, and on the TV behind him, we see Jane in her window. She stands exposed, trying to look defiant but is vulnerable. Suddenly, the Colonel enters, incensed. Ricky turns around, realizes the situation, and tries to dodge his father, but the Colonel punches Ricky, knocking him to the floor. Jane watches from her window, pulling the drapes. Ricky's lip bleeds, but he maintains his gaze at his father during the beating, and the Colonel continues to hit him in the window across from her.",
    "1250": "She stands and stares at Andy with a vaguely pleased smile. Andy nods and holds her hand out to receive the coat, but Miranda tosses it and her handbag onto Emily's desk and marches into her office. Andy stares at the coat, which has been slung over Emily's monitor screen and sits stiffly down in her own chair. Miranda comes to the door. Andy reluctantly picks up her telephone receiver and calls Emily, who's running down busy streets with some big bags. Emily is hit by a taxi and rolls onto its bonnet. The scarves flutter around her. Andy waits at the hospital, looking sheepish. Later, she's with Emily, who's lying in bed with a broken leg and some cuts and bruises. A man comes in with a dinner tray. Emily tucks into a jelly pot and some bread. Andy stands up and grabs her clutch bag. Andy's at a gallery show that Lily's curated. Lily leads Doug off, and Andy checks out the art, standing alone to admire the floor-to-ceiling, blown-up black-and-white photographs of street scenes. Christian is at the opening too. He spots Andy. Andy closes her eyes as rugged, fair-haired Christian kisses her cheek before leaving. Lily is seeing the kiss from across the room and walks off angrily. Andy tries to catch up. Nate follows Andy out. He stares at Andy, who gazes back, then glances aside. Nate nods, then turns and walks away. He turns back. Nate walks off. Swallowing her tears, Andy takes the call. An aerial view of Paris by night. The Eiffel Tower alive with sparkling lights. Andy is sitting in the back of a chic, chauffeur-driven car as they travel through the Paris streets and among the Champs-Élysées. She gazes out off the window, wide-eyed with excitement as they pass the city's grand buildings, shops, and hotels and the imposing Arc de Triomphe. Miranda occasionally glances over her spectacles at the view. Andy is sitting behind Nigel and Miranda, who are in the front row for the Valentino show. Models in an array of stunning gowns sashay down the runway as cameras flash. Nigel whispers in Miranda's ear. Andy's in the second row for another show and leans forward in her seat as the models parade up and down in flamboyant evening gowns. Now, Andy's at the Azzaro show, where dresses in a monochrome palette are being shown. Models and celebrities mingle backstage at the Valentino Show. Miranda talks to Valentino. Andy follows Miranda and Nigel as they head into another function past the press pack. Miranda poses for photos. Christian is close beside Andy as a TV journalist collars Nigel and Miranda. They're photographed. Andy hurries after Miranda. Later, Andy enters Miranda's suite carrying some boxes.",
    "310": "Jason finally sits and smiles warmly, speaking in over-enunciated tones. Instead of seeing his father across a table, Evan looks up at a ceiling, which is blocked by Jason's monstrous, rage-filled face and cuffed hands choking him. Jason wrestles a baton from under his chin, strikes an orderly in the kneecap, and comes for Evan, but Orderly #2 quickly beats Jason with his baton. Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock. All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter, and jams the fuse into the unlit end. Lenny paces beside the three-story mailbox, trying to appear nonchalant, then pretends to notice an untied shoe and bends to tie it. Other kids watch anxiously from the woods. Lenny finally throws the bomb in the mailbox and sprints back to the woods, where Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him. Evan pats Lenny on the back, and the four watch the mailbox intensely. Evan smiles with a cigarette between his lips and covers Kayleigh's ears with his hands; she smiles back and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches this, seems disturbed, and turns back to the mailbox. He loses his footing, falls to the ground, and Lenny falls on top of him. Evan gets up, starts running, but realizes he's not followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up, carrying him. Evan notices Lenny is completely dazed, so he doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm, and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as possible. Lenny's mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads him into an ambulance. Andrea turns to a trembling Evan on the front stoop, and he looks helpless. Evan lies on the couch, and Andrea suppresses a tiny proud smile. Suddenly, Evan's eyes roll back, and he moans and shakes. Blood trickles from his nose as a guttural sound emerges. Andrea moves to stop the bleeding. Kayleigh, repulsed, darts from the aisle and runs out with Evan following her to a small alcove, where she begins to cry. He reaches to comfort her, but she winces and pulls back her shirt collar, revealing a larger, darker bruise. She looks into his eyes, and they lean in for a tender kiss, but jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd.",
    "1377": "Harry frees Ron, and as Cedric and Cho emerge to a cheering crowd, Viktor and Hermione follow with chants of 'Krum, Krum, Krum' from the onlookers. The Beauxbatons girls appear worried, and Harry notices the blonde girl that Fleur could not rescue. He loosens the rope binding her and heads for the surface with both Ron and the girl. Attacked and held down, Harry pushes Ron and the girl upwards. They surface, coughing but safe, receiving help from a Beauxbatons girl. Underwater, Harry propels himself to the surface with a spell, bursting out onto the decking amidst the crowd. Fleur, Hermione, and even Fleur again, shower Harry with kisses, while Cedric and his friends cheer. As they walk away from the lake, Harry's friends continue cheering him on. Barty Crouch waits for Harry, and Mad-Eye approaches them, after which Barty walks away. Harry experiences pain in his head and sees Barty Crouch lying lifeless on the ground. Mad-Eye points to a door, which Harry enters, and he is left alone in the room. Harry reaches into a snack bowl, retrieves a handful, and it transforms into a small, biting creature. The man next to Dumbledore speaks, and Dumbledore shakes his hand; their handshake passes through Harry, who seems ghostly and without presence. A cage rises from the floor as proceedings begin, and Igor protests loudly, with Barty hitting the gavel repeatedly. Barty Crouch junior attempts to run and is zapped by Mad-Eye, falling into the court's center amidst an uproar. Guards seize Barty junior, as Dumbledore extracts a quivering string of magic from his head. The door opens to reveal Harry watching; Igor leaves, and Severus shuts the door in Harry's face. The champions emerge, greeted by crowd cheers and excitement from the Bulgarian crowd. As a cannon fires and Mr. Filch shrugs comically, Dumbledore groans, and Harry and Cedric enter the maze through separate entrances, which close behind them. The maze, tall and enveloped in heavy mist, confronts Cedric with closing walls, prompting him to run. Fleur, running scared, is attacked and knocked down, and Viktor finds her unconscious before continuing on. Harry sees Fleur being swallowed by undergrowth but arrives too late to help, so he sends up a red spark. A heavy wind starts blowing, and as walls close in, Harry runs.",
    "1128": "Hermione reaches out and grabs it, and they watch fearfully as the snake rears up and attacks. Hermione's spell stuns the snake, and she and Harry disapparate through the window. On a peaceful winter's day, a tree-lined river flows through a countryside white with frost. Hermione fetches water from the river and walks up the steep bank. Later, she sits reading by a smoking campfire with her back leaning against a tree, and Harry comes out of the tent, which is pitched behind her. They're both wearing warm winter sweaters, and Hermione has a blanket over her legs. She looks up at him, and he looks around. They both look thoughtful as she hands him Rita Skeeter's book, and he looks at the photographs while she frowns. A worried expression on her face, she lifts the blanket and reveals his wand in pieces. Harry sits keeping watch, leaning back against the tree, with the blanket over his shoulders, holding Hermione's wand. He takes out the piece of broken mirror and gazes into it, seeing the mirror reflect an empty room. He drops the mirror onto the ground and wraps the blanket tight around his shoulders, while behind him, a dim light glows inside the tent. Clutching Hermione's wand, Harry looks deep into the forest, his eyes widening as he spots a light in the distance. It comes closer, glowing ever brighter, taking the shape of a translucent silvery doe. Harry shrugs off the blanket, gets to his feet, and moves cautiously towards it. He stops and watches as the doe turns and moves slowly away, prompting Harry to follow. The doe stops and glances back, then moves on, trotting across a stretch of frozen water with a light covering of frost. The shape of the doe shrinks to a ball of light, and the tip of Hermione's wand glows as Harry steps gingerly onto the ice. As he nears the light, it floats towards him and then sinks below the ice. He crouches down and wipes away the frost from the surface to reveal a sword lying gleaming under the ice. Looking around cautiously, Harry aims the wand and stands up, causing the ice above the sword to crack and a hole to appear. At the water's edge, Harry removes his clothes, except for his boxer shorts, with the locket still around his neck. He treads barefoot and wearily across the frost-covered ice until he reaches the hole, places Hermione's wand on the edge, and submerges his right foot in the water. Shivering, he gazes at the sword, takes a breath, and drops feet first through the hole in the ice, swimming down towards the gleaming sword. He reaches out to grasp it but suddenly grabs the chain of the locket, struggling for breath.",
    "526": "The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building to Elliot's analyst's office, where the psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window. The music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair, holding a long, thin cigarette and wearing a gold Rolex watch. Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag, and the camera follows the cigarette up to his face as he looks thoughtful, before the movie cuts to Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other students as she passes. Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a professor, who is running over to her, calling her name. They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together before the film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office. Back inside the scene transitions to a restaurant with glass and metal doors where a waiter in uniform stands holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar, and a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground. The camera follows the sisters, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time they walk in. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation. Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room, while she talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away. Lee takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag. The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area and signals for the sisters to follow her. The sisters walk to their seats at a round table in the middle of the room, and the hostess puts down their menus before leaving. Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette while other waiters clear off a table. As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth. Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah. The camera is back on Lee, who looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation. She fidgets and puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly circles to Hannah's face, who looks equally intense, looking at both sisters as she speaks. She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset.",
    "12": "Angela pulls her uniform open, and a profusion of red rose petals spill forth. Fully clothed, she is once again surrounded by the other girls as the high school band plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience reacts. Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience, while Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela. The game is long over when Jane and Angela come out of the gym, and Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot. Jane crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by Angela, creating an awkward beat. As Jane starts toward the parking lot, Lester stays behind. Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over Lester, who is mesmerized and feels grateful. Close on a solitary red rose petal as it falls slowly through the air. We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed, and even in sleep, Carolyn looks determined while Lester is awake and stares up at us. The rose petal drifts into view, landing on his pillow, and more rose petals fall onto the bed as he smiles up at them. Angela, naked, floats above us as a deluge of rose petals falls around her, her hair fanning out around her head and glowing with a subtle, burnished light. She looks down at us with a smile that is all things. Lester smiles back and laughs as rose petals cover his face. Jane stares at the floor and later gets out of the car, still laughing, and waves as Angela pulls away. We zoom toward Jane as she walks up the driveway. Suddenly, she turns, sensing our presence, and we see the colonial house next door where the moving van was parked earlier, with the front porch shrouded in darkness until a porch light abruptly reveals Ricky. As usual, Ricky is dressed conservatively. Irritated, Jane stares at him hard, and he looks back at her curiously, then raises his digicam and starts to videotape her. His point of view, on video, shows Jane, angry and self-conscious, turning and walking quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes. Jane enters, closes and locks the door, quickly turns off the light that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window and smiles. Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing. Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book and grabs Jane's phone to dial, standing with the receiver to his ear, nervous but frozen and unable to speak. He hangs up and exits quickly as Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair. She picks up the phone. Meanwhile, Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone. Jane then notices her address book open to the H page.",
    "145": "At the small train station near the ashram, a train pulls in as Kallenbach, beside a new Ford touring car, watches. As people disembark, he moves forward through the crowded platform, his Indian tunic unable to disguise his incisive, patrician lawyer demeanor. Amidst the chaos of Third Class passengers, Maulana Azad emerges, carrying a baby wrapped in rags, followed by the child's mother with her two little ones. Azad hands the baby to the mother, who thanks him, and he makes a small salaam before moving toward the camera. Kallenbach is with Patel, who grins; like most witty men, he loves wit in others, though he groans at times. They turn back to the train just as Mirabehn (Madeleine Slade), a tall, pretty, and extremely English woman despite her sari, tips a porter and takes a small bag. She pauses upon seeing a now-startled Kallenbach. In a different setting, the camera pans from a row of sandals by the door to a room where Gandhi sits facing Patel and Azad, carding fiber to thread while Desai makes notes in the background. Mirabehn, seated near Ba, listens intently as Gandhi's discussions unfold. Ba's spinning remains constant as Gandhi, after a solemn exchange with Azad, turns to Mirabehn, noticing her sari approvingly before a shadow passes. Mirabehn beams, nods, and exchanges a warm, teasing smile with Ba, marking the start of a lasting friendship. In a small town, six Indian police constables observe a torchlight parade with challenging disdain. The marchers, wearing loincloths and tunics, brandish torn English cloth and shout in unison.",
    "728": "Stacks of plates slide off the shelves and smash on the floor as a lifeboat flows with people away from the part of the ship which rises several stories into the night sky. People slide down the slanted deck, and Jack's eyes widen as he watches people and deck chairs smashing into each other. A brunette woman slips out of a man's grasp and slides on the deck on her stomach. All along the Titanic, people dangle from ropes, spill from railings, or slide down into the ocean. More people climb over the railing at the back of the ship. One man jumps and free falls into the icy water where small groups of survivors cling to floating debris. Standing at the rear railing, the black-haired baker watches a falling man bounce off one of the giant propellers and cartwheel into the sea. The baker pulls a flask out of his pocket and takes a drink. Jack wraps his arms around Rose as she grips onto the railing. Sitting beside Molly in a lifeboat, Ruth's eyes are glassy as she watches from a distance, while Ismay, also in a lifeboat, turns away from the carnage and squeezes his eyes shut. A crewman reaches towards a sparking circuit breaker, and a shock flings him. All along the Titanic, electric lights flicker, then go out as the rear of the ship continues to tilt upward. Blood streaming down his forehead, Lovejoy grips a side railing as it splits apart. Inside the ship, a ceiling collapses as several support columns fail, and small explosions shoot flames from portholes. A pair of men slide into the widening chasm, and the mighty ship snaps in half, sending the rear of the boat plunging back toward the sea. The back of the Titanic slaps down on the ocean surface, crushing dozens. The last of the funnels topples over as water rushes into the gap between the two sections, which are still joined at the bottom, and the Titanic rapidly fills with water and sinks. Jack climbs over the railing at the back of the ship as it tilts skyward rapidly, and passengers manage to scramble over the railing. Sheets of water glimmer in the moonlight, which rises up from the ocean, and people dangling from railings lose their grips and fall. One man bounces off a cab stand before slamming into other people hanging on below, creating a domino effect of falling bodies. A blonde maid dangles from the railing near Rose, who looks into the young woman's eyes as she loses her grip and falls. Her breath visible in the cold air, Rose turns toward the baker, who crouches on the railing beside her, and he returns her silent gaze. Finally, the entire ship sinks.",
    "1163": "The two of them step out into a corridor, the walls and floor lined with shiny black tiles. They see Fudge talking to Lucius Malfoy outside the courtroom. Harry nods nervously as the jurors exchange glances. He approaches Fudge while Dumbledore sighs and addresses the members of the jury. Some jurors murmur to each other as Fudge raises his hand. With a sickly smile, the Undersecretary raises hers, and others follow suit. Many more jurors raise their hands; Mrs. Figg raises hers, then makes to scratch her ear, and Amelia Bones raises her hand. Harry jumps to his feet, but Dumbledore has gone. At Kings Cross Station, Moody and Nymphadora Tonks lead Harry and the Weasley family across a footbridge, while a large black dog hesitates beside Harry. The huge dog trots into a waiting room and turns into a man, and Harry runs in after him. In a group photograph of 20 people, Harry's parents stand beside Sirius, and Harry hands the photograph back to Sirius. Harry walks along the platform crowded with Hogwarts' students and their families, seeing the tall, gaunt figure of Voldemort facing him. The Dark Lord twists and flexes his neck. On the train, Harry sits in a corner of the carriage, shifting uneasily and twisting his neck, while Hermione sits beside him and glances at Ron. As evening falls, the Hogwarts Express speeds along the coast, a plume of white smoke streaming from the funnel. Hogwarts School sits beside a river running down to the sea. They emerge from the train as Draco Malfoy struts along the platform. Ron holds Harry back, but Harry shakes Ron off. Outside the station, four girls sit in a horseless carriage, one of them being Cho, a pretty Oriental girl who smiles at Harry. The carriage pulls away, and Harry stares after it. As they wait for another carriage, Neville joins them, carrying a cactus. Harry turns and sees a strange creature behind him; it has a head like a horse and stretches its long leathery neck. Puzzled, Harry inspects the animal more closely. In the carriage behind it, a girl with long blond hair sits reading a magazine upside down. They all climb in, and Hermione shifts uncomfortably as they all look confused. In the great hall, Luna and the other students tuck into a luscious assortment of puddings, while Harry has an empty space beside him and looks over at Seamus, who pointedly ignores him. He stops as Professor Umbridge, the former Undersecretary, rises smiling primly. She's a small woman in a sugar-pink suit with matching accessories, and the twins are not convinced as she beams at Dumbledore. Filch applauds enthusiastically. Harry walks into the Gryffindor common room, and everyone turns to look at him, while Ron glares around the common room then follows Harry upstairs.",
    "1198": "A boy walks through a meadow with his dog when a huge dog leaps a fence and heads for him, chased by its owner. Newlyweds dangle their feet in a bath, swigging champagne from the bottle. She takes a swig, and they kiss as the snow falls outside, with the snow turning into a dense blizzard. Sun blazes on a motor cruiser in a quiet bay, where crystal blue waters wash a coastal city shore, and large houses with pools are laid out amid lakes and a golf course while a palatial hotel backs onto the crowded beach. Speedboats create foaming wakes on the water. A stone bridge crosses a wide river with traffic including a red hatchback. The couple arrives at an office building, where she hustles him out, and Jenny waits by the car as he leaves the Sun-Sentinel offices. A 4x4 drives down a suburban street; John walks out of a bungalow to pick up newspapers, one being the Sun-Sentinel. The Grogans read their papers over breakfast while she moves to the sink, and John frowns and nods. Sebastian packs a knife. John and Jenny drive up a path near a large pen of dogs; Jenny, blindfolded with John's tie, pets the pups. The Grogans' hatchback arrives at the airport with the pup excitedly on the passenger seat. The pup paws at the upholstery, staring at John. A police car drives past as John pulls into the driveway, where a patrol car and people are gathered on the street. He gets out holding the pup, while Marley knocks over dog food and later stares up with sad eyes. John switches off the garage light, returning to the house, and brushes his teeth before bed, lying with the pillow clamped to his ears. He gets out of bed, goes to the garage to pick up the pup, leaves with Marley over his shoulder, and wakes up with Marley licking his face, having ripped open a pillow and clothes. John heads for the car, closes the garage door, and Marley fidgets anxiously in his box.",
    "731": "Below the sky along the horizon, lifeboats row toward a waiting ship anchored amid floating icebergs as Rose opens her eyes when they row up alongside the ship Carpathia. Later, Titanic survivors recover on one of the ship's lower decks as nurses and crewmen flit amongst them. Still dressed in a tuxedo, Cal walks down a staircase onto the lower deck, brushes past a man, and walks into the survivors. Rose sits on a bench with a blanket wrapped around her, hooding her hair and head, and she glances up at Cal's back as he surveys the passengers, then looks away as he turns toward her, closing her eyes as Cal paces behind her. Rose peers sideways at Cal as he walks away. Her hair wet and stringy, Rose stands in pouring rain on the deck of the ship and stares up at the Statue of Liberty, the torch and crown glowing in the night. A ship's crewman holding a clipboard steps up to Rose, but Rose continues to stare up at the giant statue as the crewman moves on. Lizzy smiles. On the ocean floor, the two submersibles shine their lights on the Titanic's remains, then rise, leaving the wreck and darkness. At the surface, crewmen work to recover the submersibles, while standing with Lizzy on the research ship, Brock sniffs a cigar and then throws it into the water. Staring at Brock, Lizzy smiles and shakes her head. He turns and watches lights glint off the surface of rolling waves. Later that night, wearing only a nightgown, across the desolate deck, Rose's loose white hair blows in the wind as she clutches her hands over her heart and walks to a railing at the back of the ship. She grips the railing with one hand, pulls herself up onto the bottom rung, and stares down into the water. She unclasps her left hand, revealing the Heart of the Ocean, a large heart-shaped blue diamond that glints in the moonlight. On the deck of the Carpathia, young Rose stands in the rain and stares at the Statue of Liberty, frowning as she looks down and pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of her jacket pocket. Back on the deck of the Keldysh, Rose tosses the diamond necklace into the sea, and as the necklace sinks, Rose smiles and exhales deeply, watching as it twirls down to the dark ocean depths. Later, Rose sleeps in her berth beside her collection of framed photographs. In one picture, Rose stands beside a large fish; in another, she sits on an elephant's back. In a third, Rose wears a long scarf around her neck as she poses beside a biplane, and in another, Rose smiles astride a horse.",
    "1062": "Jack's flummoxed as Jenny picks up her parcels and goes into the living room, glaring at her father, David, who hangs his head while Jenny sighs. Jack struggles to make the next move as David gleams at Jenny, who tries to suppress a broad grin, before they drive off for the evening. Jenny looks around the sparsely furnished room with modern wooden furniture and shoots him a glance. Later, they are lying in bed together, kissing face to face. In his pajama bottoms, David gets up while Jenny sits up, watching him go through to the other room as she self-consciously adjusts her nightie. Jenny is stumped and buries her face in her pillow, while David flops down on the bed, studies her uncertainly, smiles apologetically, and hangs his head. They sit side by side on the satin as Jenny grins at David, then reaches forward and grabs a banana. Sun shines on the Eiffel Tower as Jenny and David, in film star sunglasses, wander among booksellers on the banks of the Seine. Jenny finds a book she loves and looks imploringly at David, who smiles and reaches for his wallet, holding her hand as they walk along a high wall. David boxes Jenny into position for a photo with Notre Dame Cathedral in the background; she poses, and a guy on a bicycle checks her out as he rides past. David is less than impressed, then takes another photo. They run up steep stone steps and walk arm in arm, joining other couples slow dancing in the sunshine to a record playing on a small portable turntable. They lie cheek to cheek and drink wine with a picnic by the river at dusk, where Jenny rests her head on David's shoulder. In the morning, Jenny looks out from their hotel at the great dome of the Sacre-Coeur, smiles, thinks for a moment, then shakes her head. Jenny puts a bottle of Chanel on her teacher's desk but, disappointedly, puts the bottle back in her satchel as the teacher looks up when she leaves. The words hit home, and Jenny thinks hard, challenging Miss Stubs with a look, but Miss Stubs turns away. Gray hounds burst out of starting gates onto the track as Jenny, David, Danny, and Helen are in the crowd. They climb the stands to a private suite where David shakes hands with a man by the door, then they file in. Jenny gives her coat to Danny while their contact holds court in a white dinner jacket, and Danny and David move off. Jenny and Helen drink champagne, then Danny leads Jenny to the dance floor where they move flirtatiously. Helen worriedly watches David watching them as Jenny and Danny dance with their eyes locked together, Jenny smiling with her gaze never wavering from his.",
    "667": "In the arena office, $100 is laid on the desk in front of Peter, who waits expectantly. Peter screws up his face, glares at the promoter, and then storms out of the office, passing a tall, burly unshaven guy with bleached hair who barges in and throws a canvas bag at the promoter. In the corridor, Peter overhears and, through the frosted glass wall, sees the gunman rob the promoter and make his escape. Peter stands aside as the robber escapes in the elevator. The promoter, with a gash on the right side of his temple, sneers at him. Peter then heads back along the corridor after the security guard and smacks as he calls the elevator, outside wearing a hooded jogging top over his sweatshirt. He watches police cars draw up and sees a crowd of people milling around on the sidewalk. He looks on curiously and pushes his way through the crowd to find a gray-haired old man lying on the ground. Peter is beside him as the man opens his eyes and tries to focus. His eyes light on Peter, and he attempts a smile, taking his nephew's right hand in his. Uncle Ben's eyes close, his head lulls to one side, and his grip on Peter's hand loosens until his hand slips out of the youth's grasp. Peter, tears running down his cheeks, looks at the peaceful face of his dead uncle as the young man sobs. Having overheard the cop, Peter's face grows determined, his jaw set. He stands up and walks away, runs into a dark alleyway, pulls off his zipped-up jogging top, and puts on his balaclava. Spider-Man leaps up on a wall at the end of the alleyway, clambers, climbs, and leaps up the side of a building, scurrying along with great speed. He spots a flagpole on a building opposite, jumps sailing through the air, grabs the pole with both hands, and swings round and round to build the momentum to catapult him through the air onto the adjoining rooftop. He leaps from roof to roof until he lands on top of a dome. Far below, he sees the automobile being chased by police, shoots a web to an adjacent building, and looks up at the corners of the building to which his web is attached. Glancing down at the streets way below, he takes a deep breath and launches himself off the dome. As he races towards the building opposite, he shoots another web to pull him away, then another, as he zig-zags far above the trolling streets. Each time it seems he is going to plummet to the ground, he shoots out another web and pulls himself along, like Tarzan swinging from vine to vine.",
    "1076": "Sarah gapes open-mouthed at the soaring crags as the herd moves towards a dark canyon with sheer cliffs rising on either side, casting shadows at the bottom. King George keeps watch from the top of the cliffs as four horsemen approach, riding line abreast. A fire burns in the Drovers' camp where Nullah sits on a rock, and Sarah is in her tent, writing. Flynn stares at Nullah, and up on the cliff, King George makes a fire by drilling a stick into a piece of wood and some kindling. Sarah sticks her tongue out at Flynn as he closes his eyes, and King George looks up at the star-dusted sky. As the sun comes up, the horsemen arrive on the rocky ridge, looking down at the cattle huddled in the shadowy canyon. Flynn takes his harmonica from Nullah just as something spooks the cattle. Petrol from a metal can is sprinkled on the ground by Fletcher's men; Fletcher gets off his horse, and the bearded Bull holds up a flaming torch and hurls it into the canyon. King George observes from his perch as Flynn and Nullah watch the torch falling through the darkness, igniting orange flames that leap up as it hits the ground, causing the cattle to stampede as fire erupts behind them. Drover clambers onto a rock and sees the herd thundering out of the canyon, pursued by a wall of flame, with a sheer drop ahead beyond the mouth of the canyon. Drovers urge their horses on, desperately trying to get ahead of the herd, splitting into two groups on either side. Fletcher's crew follow on a path along the cliff above. Nullah gallops along the cliff edge, steering the herd away from the precipice, and grins at Flynn as cattle tumble into the abyss. Flynn's eyes widen in fear as the cliff edge curves in front of them, with a sheer drop on one side and a mass of cattle on the other. Up on the cliff, Fletcher urges his horse on as Flynn rides next to Nullah on the cliff edge, showing off and riding one-handed. Fletcher and his men stop to look down at the herd now heading across open ground, and Fletcher gives a signal, leading to another fire being lit. As a wall of flame appears in front of the herd, Flynn's horse trips, and he is thrown off. King George watches from a high outcrop as the fire cuts the herd off from open ground, funneling them towards the cliff. Nullah reins in his horse and looks towards Flynn, who is on the ground in the path of the stampede, while the other riders try to reach Flynn, who looks in terror at the oncoming herd.",
    "818": "Rebecca is handed a bouquet and hurries after the other maids of honor as Suze's father goes to take his daughter's arm. Rebecca turns around and runs into Suze's open arms, grinning happily as she races down the aisle to join the other three bridesmaids who are processing slowly towards the altar. Suze, with her black hair pinned up in an elegant bun, composes herself and looks towards the altar at Tarquin's smiling face. After the wedding, Rebecca and the rest of the guests wave as the newlyweds are driven off in a white Rolls Royce. Rebecca, standing among the well-dressed crowd in her spotted shrug, smiles fondly. As people begin to disperse, her face starts to cloud over, as if suddenly thinking of something sad and serious along with the good things. She turns away from the church and starts walking across a city street in her pink bridesmaid dress, with a heavy tulle petticoat and long, white gloves. She walks past the window of Yves St. Laurent where a black China mannequin knocks on the window. Rebecca lifts the hem of her pink dress and considers, as a second mannequin knocks on the glass and shows her the orange bag she's carrying. Rebecca compares it to her pink one, and the mannequin jiggles the bag seductively. Rebecca's eyes fill with wonder, and she smiles eagerly, but then, with a little shake of the head, she walks on. The two doll-like mannequins look at each other; the seated one with the bag stands up, and both clap their hands. The mannequins in all the fashion windows she passes applaud her, and Rebecca starts to laugh, swinging her skirt joyfully, then stops in her tracks. Luke is standing in front of her in the middle of the pavement. She looks at him like a kid who's been caught stealing sweets and shrugs inanely. She steps towards him, and he steps towards her; they're in front of Asprey's. She shakes her head hopelessly as he looks intently into her face, and a faint smile flickers across his lips. Reaching into his coat pocket, he brings out the green scarf and wraps it around her neck. Rebecca beams at him, and he kisses her on the lips. As they kiss, a pair of ankle boots is placed in a window display, and Rebecca spots them in the corner of her eye as a tall, white-faced mannequin tilts her head and winks at her. Rebecca grins and goes back to giving Luke's kiss her full attention as the screen fades to black, leaving just the green scarf. She introduces Alicia to Janne, who kisses Alicia's hand, and then dances with Luke. Luke spots Graham throwing himself about to the music, where Graham lies on his back and Jane turns his legs like a wheel.",
    "409": "Standing poised by the door, the classroom doors open and students start to file out. Elaine comes out of the classroom and starts walking down the corridor towards the exit door, with Ben following her, moving out of the way of the other students. Elaine and twenty other girls are in basketball uniforms as Elaine sits on the bench, watching. Ben stands behind her, and she turns and looks at him. Elaine jumps up, applauding a shot, and several other girls run onto the court while a number of girls run off the court to the bench. Later, Ben is seated across a study table from Elaine with many other students scattered around the room. She starts to get up and begins to move away. Ben and Elaine are standing at the entrance, and Ben remains standing in exactly the same position. After a few moments, the door opens, Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben, kisses him, then runs back inside. Ben turns and starts away from the door as a tall bearded man comes out and goes past Ben. Through the window of a hippy jewelry store, a saleswoman is modeling a ring for Ben. He nods, she takes it off, puts it in a box and gives it to him. He pays for it and exits past the camera, whistling. Ben enters carrying four oddly shaped boxes and some flowers, whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a time. He opens the door to his room and steps in; the room is dark and the figure of a man is silhouetted against the window. Ben freezes just inside the door before taking a step forward. Mr. Robinson stands at the door, opens it, and starts into the hall, then turns back from the hall. Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs, where Mr. McCleery is standing on the stairway, listening. Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr. McCleery, who looks up at Ben. Ben walks to the door, looks out into the hall at Mr. McCleery, then shuts the door. He stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the stairs and out of the building. Through the door, we see him run down the street and out of sight, with Ben reacting. The elevator at the end of the hall opens, and a fat girl walks toward us with an envelope in her hand, then walks into the camera. Ben is driving his car as the sound of an envelope being read is heard. Ben follows her through the hall into Mrs. Robinson's room, where Mrs. Robinson, without stopping, puts Elaine's clothes down next to a half-packed open suitcase on her bed and moves to a telephone on the night table.",
    "253": "Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information, walks out of the alley, and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard in North Hollywood, where everything appears normal: the laundry room, the pool, and his apartment door are undisturbed. Butch climbs the stairs to his apartment, number 12, steps outside the door, listens inside, and slowly inserts the key, quietly opening it to find that his apartment hasn't been touched. He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door, takes a quick look around, walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator before going to the bedroom. His bedroom, like the rest of the apartment, is neat, clean, and anonymous, and sure enough, the watch is as he said it was—on the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. He walks through the apartment back into the kitchen, opens a cupboard, takes out a box of Pop Tarts, puts down the milk, opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts, and puts them in the toaster. Butch glances to his right and sees a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on the kitchen counter, which makes him laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player, and when the music starts, he sings along with it. He drives by the apartment but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut, still chuckling and singing along with the song. Marsellus Wallace exits Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee, steps off the curb, and crosses the street in front of Butch's car. Laughing boy stops when he sees Marsellus in front of him; Marsellus casually glances at Butch, continues walking, and Butch stomps on the gas pedal. The Honda slams into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts, and the coffee hitting the pavement at thirty miles an hour. Butch cuts into cross traffic and is broad-sided by a gold Camaro Z-28, breaking all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what was Fabienne's Honda, with blood flowing from his nostrils, as a pedestrian pokes his head inside. Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street, gawkers gather around the body, and the yelling makes Marsellus come to.",
    "459": "Inigo pushes slowly off from the wall again and attacks, slashing with wondrous skill, but none of his blows get through, so he moves forward as Count Rugen retreats more quickly around the table. Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him, and then his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot where Inigo was wounded. The six-fingered sword strikes, creating a slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks; the great sword flashes again, leaving a parallel slash on Rugen's other cheek. Inigo, moving almost too fast for the eye to follow, strikes one final time, hitting dead center, and the sword is clear through the Count. They are almost frozen like that for a moment, then Inigo withdraws his sword, and the Count pitches down, lying dead. Rugen’s skin is ashen, and blood pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks, with his eyes bulging wide, full of fear, while Inigo stares at him. Westley lies as before, unmoving with his head on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side, as Buttercup is alongside the bed, her eyes never leaving his face. Humperdinck enters the room, staring at them, and pulls out his sword. Westley lies there comfortably, speaks quietly at first, gripping his sword, and then stops, as a look of fear returns to Humperdinck’s eyes. Humperdinck tries to hide the growing fear inside him, while Westley stares at him and slowly begins to move, turning his body, placing his feet on the floor, and standing with his sword in a fighting position. Prince Humperdinck, in a state of panic, doesn’t know whether to pee or wind his watch, eventually throws his sword to the floor. Westley speaks to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits, and as she sets to work, Inigo enters, looking around. Humperdinck begins wrestling with his bonds as they look at each other, then move to the balcony, where Fezzik stands below, leading four great white horses. He glances up to see them on the balcony as Inigo, Westley, and Buttercup look down at him. Fezzik holds out his arms as Buttercup floats through the air, jumping from the balcony so Fezzik can catch her, and her fall, appearing in slow motion, resembles flying.",
    "1354": "Alice, unexpectedly full of depth and truth in her role, begins to cry while performing her lines, stunning Charles, who watches in awe, feeling giddily transported. Joe, as he stares, becomes galvanised, realizing his interest in Alice has solidified, while Martin is taken aback by the passion and heart of her performance. During the heat of the moment, Alice looks at Charles, unsure, as he runs to her and takes her script pages. They prepare to film Alice with an approaching train in the background, as Charles puts on the headphones, and they start shooting. Joe glances back at the headlights and notices the distant vehicle turning onto the tracks, becoming unsettled. As the train passes them, Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines, and Charles is almost laughing at how good it looks, but Joe desperately looks back at the headlights. Joe swings the microphone down and yells, prompting everyone to run off. The train wheels' odd, dying chugs and screeches run out of momentum, accompanied by hisses of steam and the unnatural bending of steel. In the dust, Joe lies frightened on the ground with his eyes tightly shut, his mind racing and heart pounding, until he hears a loud metal bang. Joe quickly stands up and sees a mountain of twisted steel with upside-down train cars piled around him, realising he narrowly avoided being crushed. Hearing another metallic sound, Joe backs up, frightened by the labored groaning, whether mechanical or animal. As the crazy screeches and bangs continue, Joe grips his necklace locket tightly until a loud crash occurs, and a twisted ten-foot square train sliding door stabs the ground twenty feet away. Joe, stunned, turns to see the door and back to the noise's direction, but it's gone. Meanwhile, Charles' camera, on its side, finishes recording. Joe moves toward the camera, with Cary appearing behind him, smiling, having enjoyed the crash. As Joe whips around, he sees Alice standing in the dusty mess, shaken but alive. Joe beams, then suddenly realizes something and moves to the blood, reaching below the wheels as the others watch in horror. Joe pulls out his crushed makeup kit and brightens. They all move toward Preston, except for Cary, who heads off, to discover crates spilling from a nearby split car, many shattered, revealing thousands of small white-metal cubes littering the ground.",
    "68": "The car trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded white sheet. A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler. DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to OPEN. The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then drops his head in his hands. The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by. DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee. The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee. Another CUSTOMER leans in the door. The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model. The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase. Hands him a picture. The CUSTOMER exits. Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter. A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB. SILENT BOB lights a smoke. SILENT BOB points to something off-screen. SILENT BOB nods. JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly. The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face. VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the throng. Everyone turns to face VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher. The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C. The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door. VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST. She pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly. He reaches into his briefcase. He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads it. He nods. He nods again. She blasts him with more chemical as he exits. He quickly flees. The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances. VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted. DANTE tries to regain his composure. The last of the crowd exits. DANTE is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms. She slaps him.",
    "126": "She snaps the bag shut. He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket. She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her. She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to Phyllis again. He goes off. She stares after him. He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate book, making a quick telephone call. Keyes enters with some papers in his hand. The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs the phone and answers. Neff picks the phone up and answers. Phyllis is on the phone. Neff on the phone. His eye catches Keyes', who is walking up and down. He speaks into the phone as calmly as possible. Neff on phone. He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window. He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes stays right where he is. Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again. Neff on the phone. Neff gets up from his desk. He punches his stomach with his fist. Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed. He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm. Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage and goes down the ramp into the basement. There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm. He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts that into his pants pocket. Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in each of these.",
    "1232": "A bald boy in a dressing gown and pajamas spots Ben, who smiles and nods before briefly returning to his reading. Ben takes a paper cup, sucks on the straw, and observes the boys and a woman, who smiles as she watches the boys. The bald boy glances shyly at Ben and then looks down. Behind them, in Ben's line of sight, Emily sits at a table by a window. Ben resumes reading. Emily, in a short strappy dress over a vest top, approaches Ben's table, glances at the bald boy, and speaks, prompting Ben to get out his ID. Ben smiles, puts Emily's files back in his briefcase, and leaves with a polite smile while Emily remains at the table, looking drained and dejected. A blue and white neon sign for the Travel Inn glows in the night as Ben arrives in his saloon outside the motel, gets out, and goes to the reception window. He goes to look through an open door, where a pudgy bearded guy spots him and comes out from behind a lacy curtain. Ben returns to the reception window where the guy greets him, then lets himself into a dark room, carrying his cases, placing his keys on a table, and shutting the door. In dim lamp light, Ben sits on his bed, takes a book and a file filled with newspaper cuttings out of his bag, and studies the first cutting intently, beneath which are photos of the seven people killed. Ben watches an ice hockey practice where two players collide and fight. Elsewhere, Emily puts the phone down, scans the room, opens French windows, and goes outside, shocked to find Ben feeding Duke. Duke pulls her, then pulls Ben. Emily gets a container out of her fridge while Ben studies documents. Emily stares astonished at him, brow furrowed, as he stares down at the table they're sitting at. She fiddles with her collar, while he smiles good-humoredly and considers. Once again, Emily looks astounded as Ben grins and looks down, and she blinks, taken aback, as the decision sinks in. Ben gets up, and they share a lingering look. He smiles broadly and heads out while Emily ponders. He turns back, and Emily walks up to him, as he stares at her with sad, gentle eyes, raising his eyebrows before looking serious. She stares at Ben and blinks as he gives an awkward, white-toothed grin and makes for the front door. They hold each other's gaze.",
    "137": "The scene unfolds in the dimly lit station, where the camera angle restricts our view. A sergeant is positioned on the station's low sloping roof, and nearby, the captain sharply addresses two of his detail. He slowly turns his head, mouth agape, surveying the scene before him. The platform is densely packed with waiting crowds, extending from the station house and onto the narrow street lined with homes, their rooftops teeming with men, women holding babies, and children. As Gandhi disembarks from the train, guided by Shukla with Ba and Charlie a step behind, he moves through the silent crowd, hands in the pranam, bowing slightly. The crowd parts quietly, their clothing indicating a Muslim area, some offering a salaam or tentatively returning the pranam to Gandhi as he passes. Faces in the crowd appear gaunt and lean. Suddenly, a commotion arises; the sound of boots precedes the English captain as he pushes through to face Gandhi in the aisle formed by the crowd. The sergeant and part of the detail follow behind the captain, who stares before glancing suspiciously at the crowd with a hint of inner fear, then back at Gandhi. There's a flicker of uncertain recognition before another authoritative glance at the crowd. The captain, shaken by Gandhi's composed demeanor, glances at Charlie standing behind Gandhi, which further undermines his confidence. Attempting severity, the captain's demeanor falters, his weak authority evident. Unsettled by Gandhi's steady gaze, he looks at Charlie again, feeling the emptiness of his own weakness. Finally, he briskly turns, shoving past the crowd. Where silence once prevailed, excitement buzzes as Gandhi, having already won a subtle victory, continues forward, exchanging pranams with the crowd's warm greetings. The early sunlight bathes the scene, highlighting Meha, a middle-aged man appearing ill and drawn, lying on a straw mat.",
    "1003": "He nods to Nick and takes a deep breath as Gatsby sneaks furtively into the kitchen area and peers through the flowers into the room. Watching from the door, Nick takes off his boater and gestures for Gatsby to tidy his hair, which he smooths back with his hand. Finally, appearing confident and relaxed and with the old familiar glint in his eyes, Gatsby steps towards the room where Nick stands beneath a tree in the rain. Drenched, Nick returns and sees Gatsby and Daisy deep in conversation, then he rattles a bowl in the sink to make his presence known, but Daisy and Gatsby don't notice and continue looking into each other's eyes, smiling at each other. Nick gives up, walks in, and takes off his coat. Gatsby glances at the window then returns his unwavering gaze to Daisy, whose dark eyes return his gaze adoringly. Gatsby smiles, gets up, and opens the French windows, revealing a bright blue sky peeping through the diminishing rainclouds as sunlight glimmers on the calm bay. They step out onto the porch, rest against a pillar, and their fingers touch as they look at each other. He points across the bay before Gatsby walks back inside, and they walk up the drive. Daisy looks up in wonder, surrounded by gushing fountains and ornamental palms, they look up at the house. Gatsby looks at Daisy, framed by the fountain, and an orange-squeezing machine is there. Daisy, Gatsby, and Nick swim on his private beach, and Gatsby dives from a diving pontoon out in the water while Nick films Daisy hitting a golf ball. They tumble into the ballroom where Daisy marvels at the monumental organ, and Gatsby takes Daisy and Nick on a tour. He throws shirts from a balcony, and Daisy flops onto the pile of brightly colored shirts on the bed as Nick looks down from the balcony in the opulent bedroom. Noticing the change in Daisy's mood, Gatsby goes down to the bed where she sits, strokes her chin, and she looks up at Nick, who walks away somberly as Gatsby kisses her brow. Nick walks down a spiral staircase and looks at a wall and a desk where pictures and trophies are displayed, including a photograph of a distinguished old man. Gatsby sits on his bed, holding Daisy close to him, and Daisy rests her head in Gatsby's lap and follows his gaze to the window and beyond. Nick walks over, takes a book from a shelf, and opens it, touched, Daisy runs her fingers over them. Gatsby goes to the other side of the room to answer the phone, turning his back to Nick and Daisy. Outside, a strong swelling breeze whips up on the balcony, blowing the French windows open, which Nick closes and listens to Gatsby.",
    "256": "A weaving knee-level tracking shot follows a six-year-old boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he tramps around the trailer, brandishing a big stick, before shifting focus to Hi, who bends down to pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator, raising his voice to be heard over the din of children. As Hi considers the situation, he looks down, starts laughing, then catches himself, while the bam-shouting six-year-old bangs a stick on the TV and a kid in a cowboy hat slaps Hi on the ass. Hi takes a sip of beer and looks at another child finishing off the T in FART in crayon on the wall as Glen chuckles at his errant child, just before the sound of shattering glass is heard. Glen looks around, then Dot faces Hi and Ed across a picnic table covered with grilled hamburgers, rolls, a green jello mold, and a cooler, as one younger child occasionally flings jello at Hi, unnoticed by the two women. Hi sits stock-still with a stony face as Dot shrieks, then he shrugs and flinches at jello hitting his shoulder while Dot looks offscreen. The scene shifts to tracking on Hi and Glen walking side by side, with Glen sopping wet, in a swimming suit and wing-tipped shoes, his body ghostly pale except for a bright angry red V-area and arms below the short sleeve line. Glen bursts out laughing, slaps Hi on the back, and chuckles as he eyes Hi shrewdly. Both stop walking; Hi looks puzzled at Glen, who lays a companionable hand on Hi's shoulder and speaks confidentially, nodding energetically through clenched teeth, until THWAK - Hi's fist connects with Glen's jaw, sending him airborne and landing in a heap. Glen rubs his jaw groggily as Hi approaches menacingly, prompting Glen to run, with Hi pursuing. Glen, looking back, shouts at Hi but crashes into a tree and drops like a sack of cement. Later, Hi drives with his jaw rigidly set and temple throbbing, while Nathan Jr. sits in a safety seat between him and Ed.",

He watches a moment, then cautiously lifts the binoculars again. He turns and again glances out of the window. The man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars pan him through to the small kitchen, which is seen through a side window. The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory. Jeff lowers the binoculars, and there is an expression of exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him. He backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard door, and takes out a long-focus lens. From a shelf above, he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye. Through the viewfinder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. His back is still to us. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper. He spreads it open along the drainboard. From the sink, he takes out a large butcher's knife and a long, narrow saw. They disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. Having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper-wrapped parcel. For a moment, he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. Jeff lowers the camera for a moment and watches tensely. Suddenly, he puts it up to his eye again. Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room. He sits down on a couch with a display of fatigue. He is not carrying anything. Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. He yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch. Jeff lowers the camera. He watches the living room for a moment, then his eye travels briefly back to the kitchen and returns to the living room. The thermometer outside of Jeff's window registers 83 degrees. The camera pans off to the left until it comes to rest on the songwriter's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano, and plays a couple of notes with one hand while he stands.",
    "449": "The scene plays in dimness, save for the shaft of light from the entrance hall. Wick goes and sits beside Don, taking the glass from his hand, and then bends over Don to loosen his tie. Ignoring the sound of steps coming from the staircase, Wick rises, places the glass of whiskey on the table, and is about to head towards the telephone when the doorbell rings in a pattern of short, short, long, short. Wick freezes, and Don sits up on the couch, pulling himself up by clinging to Wick's arm. Wick pushes Don through the doorway into the dark bedroom and closes the door after him. Wick then snaps on the living room lights, rolls the empty bottle under the couch, and hides the glass of whiskey behind a pile of records. As Wick starts towards the door, the bottle rolls out from under the couch, so he stops to roll it back before going into the hall to open the door. Helen enters, and as she speaks, Wick tries to approach the bottle without her noticing. Suddenly, she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under the couch. Wick then walks over to the records, picks up the glass, and listens with his head against the doorpost, harassed. Helen comes into the living room, and Wick takes a drink. Wick stands, startled with the glass of whiskey in hand, as Don enters unsteadily. Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back into the room, staring at Don and beginning to realize that he's drunk. Don looks at the glass in Wick's hand, takes it from him, opens a drawer, removes two bullets, and holds them in his palm. Helen looks at him for a second, then removes and tosses her hat into a chair. Wick goes into the kitchenette, and Helen raises herself to her tiptoes to kiss him warmly. Meanwhile, Nat and Don are alone, with Nat behind the bar putting toothpicks into olives and arranging them on a plate. Don jumps up, runs to the bookcase, and starts pulling out books row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, and throws all its contents on the floor before returning to the big chair to collapse, exhausted. His eyes again fall on the empty bottle and the empty glass, noticing something written on it distorted by the glass.",

To Parvati and Padma's annoyance, Harry and Ron won't dance, so the four of them sit glumly at the end of the room while Hermione dances wildly with Viktor, and Ron and Harry glare at Krum. Parvati is asked to dance, and she gets up with relief as Padma looks exasperated. Ron spots Krum kissing Hermione's hand before Viktor leaves her, and she spins around, her face flushed, before smiling happily as she sinks down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron gives a great sigh, and Hermione gets up to speak but thinks better of it, turns her back, and walks off, prompting Padma to glare at Ron before getting up and stalking off. Later, Ron tries to reason with Hermione, who wipes away a tear as the boys escape up the stairs. Meanwhile, Hermione flops miserably on the bottom step, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet. Neville is still dancing with Ginny, and Hagrid rests his head on Madame Maxime's chest, but his hand slips to her bottom and she puts it firmly back on her waist. Disturbed by the bell, crows rise into the darkness and swoop between the tall towers past one or two lighted windows, while snowflakes whirl outside the boys' bedroom. A large black crow flutters down onto the windowsill and peers in, while asleep in bed, Harry is having a nightmare. He sees the dark cemetery with the winged stone statue and the cloaked skeleton clutches the long scythe, with a snow-covered mansion behind it. Along the dusty paneled corridor, light shines from the open door, inside which Wormtail hovers as the young man kneels beside the armchair, revealing the dark mark tattooed on his arm, and a large snake whispers to the figure hidden in the armchair. A green flash occurs, and Harry's eyes spring open as Neville appears with his dancing shoes slung around his neck, waltzes off, and Harry smiles. Hermione looks concerned as Harry walks away, and Harry looks weary and nods, as Cedric gives Harry a knowing smile and goes. In the prefect's bathroom, Harry slips off his dressing gown and lowers himself into a bath the size of a small swimming pool, leans back under the bubbles, and is watched by a mermaid in a stained glass window who holds back her long golden hair. Harry turns to the golden egg standing on the side of the bath and opens it, but slams it shut again as a ghostly figure appears out of the lavatory, floats toward him, and dives into the bubbles. Harry grabs the egg, twists it open under the water, and as the egg glows brightly, Harry takes a deep breath and sinks down after it before bursting to the surface.",
    "470": "In a dimly lit room cluttered with disorder, with candlelight flickering and Leopold's portrait watching, papers cover the table, dirty dishes stack in the fireplace, and Mozart's Masonic apron lies on the forte-piano. Standing beside Constanze, who is asleep and worn out, an ill-looking Mozart approaches his sleeping son Karl, tenderly adjusting the child's blanket and resting his head beside him. Constanze awakens to see him, and Mozart rises, returning to their shared space. Suddenly, he gleefully dances alone, gesturing rudely at his father's portrait, reverting for a moment to childlike joy, until a gentle knock on the door interrupts him. As the music fades, Mozart opens the door to a masked stranger, turns to indicate Constanze, and Salieri observes them both before departing down the stairs, leaving Mozart to shut the door and close his eyes in fear, avoiding Constanze's tearful gaze. A sharp scream from Madame Weber transitions into the Queen of the Night's aria from The Magic Flute, revealing a fantastically dressed Queen urging her daughter on stage, as a captivated audience of German citizens watches in the rearranged theatre from which Schikaneder later arrives at Salieri's door, still in bird make-up with three actresses as attendants in The Magic Flute. Salieri empties a bag of coins in front of a shocked Mozart, then begins to write the key signature, guiding the composition by humming and conducting the bass vocal line.",
    "1067": "Nullah stares into the distance as Sarah rides up to the house. Drover comes out the back door, and she freezes, keeping her back to him. On the porch, he turns slowly and looks at her, then walks towards Magarri and the horses as her eyes fill with tears. She whirls around and goes back indoors as he rides away. Nullah's dog attacks a cop chasing him, and he turns slowly to look into the eyes of a half-naked black tracker. Callahan finds Fletcher at the movies. King George is flung into a cell as Nullah is dragged away. Sarah drives through crowds on the wharf where troopships crowd Darwin harbor. Nullah is with a group of half-caste children being shipped out as his grandfather hears in his cell. Sarah drives past lines of marching troops while Nullah stares at the white boy. Troops and civilians swarm towards the wharf, and Sarah stops at a barrier and gets out of the car. Callahan drags the white boy away as a priest pulls Nullah. Crocodile boots stop in front of him, and Nullah looks up into Fletcher's face. Sarah barges her way anxiously through the crowd on the wharf as smoke rises from ships' funnels. The priest leads Nullah to a waiting boat while Fletcher observes slyly. As Sarah runs down the wharf, Nullah runs to the stern of the boat. The small boat pulls out of the shadow of the huge liners evacuating the town. The boy looks up at Sarah, and Fletcher grins. Nullah waves to Sarah, who stops at the end of the wharf. Fletcher leans on the railing next to her as the boat sails away. He turns smugly to her, grins, and saunters off. On the back of the boat, Nullah turns and looks up at a priest as Sarah leans on the wharf rail in despair, trying to control her sobs. The children's boat sails away from the wharf between huge, grey navy vessels. A Japanese fighter skims through the clouds towards an island. Sarah steps out onto the balcony and looks out over the harbor. She looks across at Drover, who's standing thoughtfully by a tree. As he whistles, Magarri stares at Drover, who looks uncomfortable and tentatively lays his hand on the tree. Magarri turns away, and tears fill Drover's eyes. Their vehicles raise a cloud of dust on the other side of the river they are camping next to. Clouds fill the sky as fighters take off at dawn from an aircraft carrier. Mission Island sits peacefully in the grey sea, beneath the cloudy sky. The children are asleep in their dormitory when Nullah wakes up with a start. Smiling unpleasantly, Fletcher hangs up the phone in his office overlooking the whole of Darwin.",
    "926": "He takes the metal case and walks out, and a small car comes flying round a corner. He hesitates and clocks her handbag, opening it without her seeing. There's a guy on a moped behind them. She streaks across the traffic, causing coffins, and the moped guy has to stop. The brunette, with high cheek bones, turns the little car into an alley off the road, while their pursuer tries to work out where they've gone. She pouts sexily and gestures to the case. They look through papers as the moped guy looks for them, but the papers are all blank. He grabs her wrist as she fires, and then, as the moped gets closer, he jumps out of the car. He turns to see the moped guy approaching, flips the bike out from under him, kicks him in the face, then rides off. He's a few cars behind the girl, riding impassively and following the girl's little bronze car. They arrive at a quay where boats are being unloaded. Furiously, she storms past a guard in dark glasses, and Bond rides onto the quay, clocking the guard in a floral shirt carrying a sub-machine gun. The girl strides into an office as an official stamps a docket, standing over the Frenchman while the thin German speaker looks nervous. There's a body floating in the water under the quay, and a powerful speedboat approaches. He gives the guard a card and looks up at a security camera before walking off, as the German in square shades looks at a card from Universal Exports. Bond activates the tracking function on his phone. Pay attention next time. He approaches the heavyset general with the bushy mustache. He holds up a map, and the general eyeballs the little Frenchman, takes the map nodding. The girl glares at them, and he waves her over. A burly hand grabs her arm, and Bond watches with a frown before riding away. Camille is led to the speedboat. Bond rides through the busy docks, standing in the saddle to look around. Dominic waves an ironic goodbye as the boat with Camille on it pulls away, and she looks with sultry hatred in his direction. Bond jumps the bike off the quay into a boat, rides over some crates, jumps onto another boat, then abandons the machine. The launch is heading towards a huge luxury cruiser, and Bond runs across the closely packed boats crammed with merchandise. He leaps onto a small launch, pulls the starting cord on the outboard motor, and starts to shadow the general's boat. He rams the boat, and Dominic watches in disbelief as the crew on the cruise grabs weapons and jumps into an inflatable. Bond boards the launch, and Camille grabs a gun but Bond knocks it into the water, grabs her, and drags her off the boat into his.",
    "1283": "Stunned people pick themselves up off the ground as the vast metallic-skinned robot stands immobile with the sphere swirling in light and vapor behind it. The visitor's body is rushed to a medical facility on a covered gurney, with Helen accompanying it. A sarcophagus-like gurney is wheeled to a prefab hut in a hangar where the protective cover is unsealed. Mike looks baffled while Helen glances at him, and his scalpel cuts into the patient's gray, gelatinous skin, causing the gray skin to come apart as the surgeon drops the bullet into a sample tube. Helen slowly shakes her head as the surgeon, wearing a suit that even covers his feet, drops lumps of blubbery flesh into a basin. On the operating table, the naked, slime-covered body of a man curls up into a fetal position, and Mike and Helen stare in disbelief. The patient lies under a protective tent attended by a technician before Helen enters the room, descending three steps from the gallery area where she was watching, and cautiously approaches the tent. She peers in and sees the man's eyes fluttering. The patient begins thrashing around inside the tent, and Mike comes in to check a monitor. The Secretary's chopper touches down at Fort Linwood while the being lies on a gurney wearing gray hospital pajamas and an oxygen mask. Officials stand at a window overlooking the room as, watched closely by Helen, Mike removes the oxygen mask and offers the being a cup of water, which he takes and draws shakily towards him. They all watch him intently, the Secretary taking a step towards him as he uses both hands to steady the plastic beaker, while they all stare. Regina glances at the scientists as Helen steps forward to help him put down the cup, noting that he looks just like the climber from 1928. His head swivels towards her. Helen enters a storeroom with shelves full of vials of drugs, leans back against the door to compose herself, then takes a hypodermic in a sealed packet from a glass cabinet, putting it in her pocket and scanning the shelves. The agent hands her a vial which she pockets along with a vial of saline solution, then goes to the syringe cabinet, opens, and closes the door before turning around and holding up the syringe packet for the benefit of the suspicious agent. Jaw thrust forward, Regina eyeballs Klaatu, and having swapped the two vials, Helen approaches him, rolls up his sleeve, and jabs the hypodermic into his arm. The Defense Secretary watches dispassionately then turns away as Klaatu's dark eyes stare at Helen. Three military policemen surround Helen and escort her from the room as Klaatu glances down at his arm while the agent from the drugstore comes in, and they eyeball one another.",
    "522": "Holly stays under the awning as Mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back at her. People pass by while Mickey walks back and forth from the curb to Holly, becoming angrier. A taxi pulls up, and Mickey and Holly walk to the rear door. Mickey holds the door open for Holly, who gets in and then slams the door. Mickey starts walking along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off, passing the hotel and several evening-lit store windows. Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey from view. In the reflection of a mirror over a dresser, Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek; they dance into view. Elliot picks up a glass of champagne and hands it to Lee, who sips. Elliot sips from his glass and returns it to the dresser. They embrace tightly, continuing to dance. Elliot, Hannah, and the twins are sitting at the dining room table. Hannah shows her two adopted children how a small camera works while they observe, fascinated. Elliot looks listless and stares blankly at the table. One child takes the camera from Hannah and picks up another identical one. The adopted children leave with the twins. After they're gone, Hannah sips her coffee and looks at Elliot, then puts her cup down while still watching him. Hannah sighs, and Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table, stands up, paces behind her, and sits back down beside her with a ketchup bottle in front of him. The camera moves in on Elliot's anguished face as he looks down. Hannah tenderly puts her hand on his shoulder, touches his hand, and Elliot embraces her. Elliot kisses Hannah and they embrace tightly while she touches his hair. A metal staircase next to a large white column appears on screen; Holly and Hannah's voices are heard as they walk up the stairs into view. A man carrying a shopping bag walks down the steps past them. Holly follows Hannah to a rack of blouses; Hannah takes a jacket off the rack, looks at it, and holds it to herself. Turning to Holly with surprise, she puts the jacket back on the rack, inhales, and stares at her sister, who watches with a frown. Hannah then looks at the rack of clothes on Holly's side and takes a blouse off to examine it.",
    "1355": "Joe kneels and picks something up as Cary calls out from behind, having climbed the angled sides of overturned train cars. They move up the mass of metal to reveal a vast view of the wreck, which seems to stretch on forever. Cary points to a pick-up truck thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage, sheared in half and lying in the overgrown grass. As the kids approach from the wreckage, the sight stuns them, and they stop. Inside the crushed truck is Dr. Woodward, 75, seat-belted, bloody, and unconscious. Alice, scared and sad, moves closer and nudges him, realizing he appears dead as his arm drops limp, revealing a paper that falls to the ground. Joe picks up the paper and unfolds it, revealing an old, off-white map. They hold it up and see marker writing on it, a black line from Nevada to Dayton, with numbers along the way. Suddenly, a trembling hand appears and rips the map away, causing them all to scream as Dr. Woodward is revealed, with bloody eyes open and in a daze. Speechless, they finally react but distant voices make Joe turn his head to see through the wreck. Their minds racing, the kids start moving away. Charles grabs his camera as Alice hurries past, searching for her keys while eyeing the approaching flashlight men. Joe grabs his make-up kit and runs to the car, followed by the boys as Alice slams the car into reverse, narrowly avoiding debris and driving away as the flashlight men—soldiers—arrive with adrenaline pumping. Colonel Nelec steps up to the camera, eyeing the vanishing car suspiciously, then looks down at a fresh, empty yellow Super 8 film box, picks it up, examines it, then back at the disappearing car. His burning eyes focus before the Buick speeds past with a roar, as Charles obsesses over his camera amidst the overlapping mayhem.",
    "306": "Freddy enters the frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, finishing his sentence, and in a wider shot, he is seen performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking lot while pacing back and forth. Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie, and Mr. White sit around a table in a red-lit, smokey bar. Freddy is then standing in front of six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd, with all eyes on him. Everyone is frozen, resulting in a freeze frame of Freddy in front of the sheriffs. A slow 360-degree shot is taken around Freddy in the men's room, followed by a 360-degree camera move around the men. The dog barks, and a sheriff yells at it to quiet down. A couple of sheriffs look at Freddy off-screen, but turn their attention to Sheriff #2 as he continues his story. The camera pans from the sheriffs to Freddy, who is up against the urinal, pretending to urinate, and then continues to pan with him. A sheriff is sitting on a sink, and Freddy finishes washing his hands, goes to dry them but there are only hand drying machines. He turns one on, and a close-up shows his hands being blown dry. Mr. Orange looks from left to right. The machine turns off, Freddy turns, and walks out of the room. Joe lights a cigar, and Freddy answers it, with the camera following the receiver up to his face. A close-up shows Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone before placing the receiver back in its cradle. The camera follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment, getting everything he needs, puts on his jacket, and exits frame. Inside an unmarked car across the street, two cops see Freddy walk out of his building and up to Eddie's parked car. Freddy gets into the car driven by Nice Guy Eddie, with Mr. Pink in the passenger seat, and they pull into traffic as the car laughs, reacts horribly, and laughs again. The camera tracks across the men's faces, Joe points a finger, and everybody laughs. The camera leaves the team and focuses on a blackboard with a layout of the jewelry store. The outside of the jewelry store is shown, a car whips around the corner into the alley, the doors burst open, and Mr. White hops out. The alley is empty, Freddy opens the side door, runs to the end of the alley just as a police car comes into sight, and Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.",
    "439": "The scene begins with individuals wearing terry-cloth bathrobes over their pajamas and canvas slippers on their feet. Among the listless, burned-out group, Don moves with purpose and has canvas slippers on his feet. Around him, about thirty alcoholics are sitting and milling aimlessly. The space is L-shaped and about fourteen feet wide. Don moves around the bend of the ell towards a heavy wooden door with a grated peephole beside which stands a uniformed guard. He tries to open the door, but at that moment, another male nurse opens it, carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillowcases. Don attempts to take advantage of the open door to escape, but the guard pulls him back by the arm, while the entering nurse locks the door with his key. Don turns, and at the bend of the corridor, he sees Bim holding a tumbler of medicine. Don slowly approaches Bim, who eventually seats him on his bed. It is lighted by a faint blue light, with light from the anteroom coming through the glass doors. On his cot, Don lies with his eyes wide open. He pivots towards a sound and observes a man in the corner with a sensitive face and an addiction to beetles. The man is slapping wildly at his bed, moaning, then rises to slap the wall and scream. Don watches through the dimness as two male nurses with flashlights rush to the DT victim's cot, leading to a wild struggle as the patient fights them off. One nurse races back to the door to call for assistance. A third nurse arrives, throws a straitjacket to the first nurse, and hurries to another bed. Seen through the glass doors, a doctor runs down the anteroom, followed by another male nurse with a cart carrying hypodermic syringes. The doctor enters the ward and heads towards the beetle patient, tossing his dark blue overcoat onto the empty cot next to Don as he runs. Don looks after the doctor, who, along with the nurses, works over the beetle patient, administering a hypo and securing him in a straitjacket. As the doctor's gaze reaches Don's pajama trousers and canvas slippers, the scene captures the chaotic and tense environment in the ward.",
    "645": "The teacher sees Salim and Jamal. The boys fight over the book, and he grabs the book and whacks it over Jamal's head. In the present day, back in the police station, Srinivas inserts a VHS into a player. Jamal is slumped in a chair opposite the inspector's desk, and Srinivas slaps Jamal, who then stares at the ground. The inspector points the remote control at the TV. The five-year-old Jamal squats over a hole in a makeshift shanty toilet while Salim sits guard outside. A man rushes down towards the toilets as Prakash leans over painfully. Jamal pulls his pants up, and old clips of Amitabh's 70's action films play. A helicopter flies over Jamal's roofless loo. Salim jams his chair against the door, locking Jamal in. Through a hole in the wall, Jamal sees hundreds of men, women, and children flock to the runway. He kicks the door in vain and takes out of his pocket a creased photo of his hero, Amitabh Bachchan. He looks down through the hole in the floor to the cesspit beneath, looks from the cesspit to the photo and back, then pinches his nose and jumps, keeping one arm aloft to hold the photo clear of the effluent. Amitabh descends from his helicopter to cheering crowds. Jamal appears covered from head to toe in excrement, dashes towards Amitabh, making his way through the crowds of photographers and onlookers. Salim stands at the front of the crowd, hemmed in by security. In the distance, we see Jamal running, holding onto his photo of Amitabh. The crowd parts for stinking Jamal, who makes straight for Amitabh. Salim stares at his brother in disbelief as people hold their noses. Amitabh signs the photo and hands it back to Jamal. A hazy orange sun rises above the teeming streets, slums, and skyscrapers of Mumbai. Jamal's mother scrubs him with soap while Salim looks back at his brother mischievously and disappears. A man sits next to a film projector in a cinema as Salim enters the projectionist's booth and shows him Jamal's autographed photo of Amitabh. The man thrusts the photo into the light from the projector, hands Salim two coins, and Salim winks and salutes the man, then bumps into Jamal outside. Jamal is on the video, and the policemen stare at him. Jamal concentrates hard and smiles briefly. Trains speed through a slum as Jamal's mother washes brightly colored clothing in a pool while young Jamal and Salim frolic in the water. Their mother smiles at the two boys playing but suddenly turns to look at the trains, worried and scared. The train passes by, revealing a crowd of men wielding clubs, knives, and axes running towards them, and people drop what they are doing and flee.",
    "1337": "Javert is puzzled. Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover a heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver, Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate. The cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man, but it is too heavy, and the ground is too soft. Valjean, Javert, and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they cannot get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end and braces himself to lift it from beneath. At one end, the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking because the ground is harder here. Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent. Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue. Fantine presses on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors. They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways. The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear by the end of the chorus. A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear fragments of his sales pitch. Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the voices of the whores on either side. Fantine heads to the tooth man. A pimp and the head whore watch her progress as the organ-grinder grinds out the music. Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore. The pimp pushes her down. She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth. She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in as everyone gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth is removed. The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they are all fit for business. He moves in on Fantine. Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth. The whores cluster around her, hands reaching out to draw her into their world. On the rotting warship, more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus. Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge Fantine's cheeks. The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the hulk. Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the rotting ship. The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to Fantine who wears a filthy white dress.",
    "787": "Marcus looks incredulously at Willie who drags on a fag. In a boxing setting, Marcus talks to the kid, who is his opponent, and Marcus looks him over. The kid steps forward and kicks Marcus in the crotch, doubling him up. He punches the kid low, whacks Willie in the balls too, and hits Marcus in the nuts, resulting in all three combatants lying, writhing in agony, on the canvas. Willie turns to the kid, and they kick at each other. That night, Grandma has collapsed in front of the TV in the lounge when Willie and Sue come in and see her. Granny lies back on the sofa, deathly still, with her mouth agape. They walk a little closer, and Willie goes over to her. Sue looks on anxiously as Willie bends over Granny, then he looks around at Sue, holds his hand in front of Grandma’s mouth, and checks for a heartbeat. Granny suddenly comes to. Later on, in a bedroom, a black rug is spread out on the floor, with odd discarded clothes lying on it. Nearby, Sue lies on her back in her bra and jeans, while a bare-chested Willie sits astride her, wearing his jeans and a Santa hat. He leans down and seductively licks from her navel up to her bra, then leans forward and kisses her. He kisses his way back down her body, grips her pants between his teeth, and pulls on them just as the kid comes in through the door. The kid hands Willie a roughly carved bit of wood with a ribbon around it. Mystified, Willie looks at it and holds up his injured hand, looking moved. Sue props herself up on her elbows. Willie stares at the pickle, and Sue smiles. Willie stares at her, looks at her, nods to himself, smiles, and shrugs. The next morning, Willie is back in his Santa gear and rooting around in the fridge in the kitchen when the kid runs in. Willie takes the report card, puts it down, and stops buttering toast. Thurman looks down sadly, and Willie angrily throws down his knife, struck dumb. Thurman picks up his report card and heads out of the kitchen. Willie watches him go, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. At night, Marcus and Lois sit in the van in the deserted mall car park watching the staff entrance and see Gin come out. Marcus and Lois watch as Gin gets in his big Chevrolet car and drives off. Gin drives down a deserted unlit road, where he sees a light swinging from side to side and the vans up the roadside.",
    "508": "At a Comic Book show during a book-signing, Holden sits at a table beside a large mock-up of a comic book cover featuring two stoner superheroes who resemble familiar drug dealers, and he hands the book back to a fan, offering a patronizingly kind half-smile in return. Across from a barely-standing fan, Banky signs the book of another collector and momentarily freezes up, but he composes himself and continues signing as a little kid steps up while the collector lingers. Holden accepts a comic from another fan and then looks to his left, freaking out as Banky is throttling the collector from across the table, with the collector attempting to fight him off. Security guards pull them apart and drag the collector away, while Holden grabs Banky. Hooper fills the frame, presenting himself as a typical pro-black/anti-white homeboy, and during his speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front. Hooper whips his head around, searching for the source of a comment, and then explodes, pulling a nine millimeter from his belt, drawing on Banky, and firing. Banky goes down, falling into the crowd as it screams and starts to scatter, while Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air. As the crowd disperses, Holden remains seated, laughing, and Hooper steps off the stage to pick Banky's head up off the floor, sounding different, almost gay, prompting Banky to smile. They turn to see a beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel named Alyssa swinging her purse in a circle. Holden hits him, and Banky seethes, offering Holden a puzzled glance and then nodding to Hooper. Holden, Banky, Alyssa, and Hooper sit around a table drinking, talking, and smoking, until Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at the table. Alyssa laughs as Holden smiles, and then a dart hits the board while another hits the wall beside it. Alyssa winds up with another dart as Holden watches and, through the window, sees a couple making out on the hood of a car. Alyssa exits to the night, and Holden stares after her. Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter holding an 'Everything's Archie' comic between them, and Banky runs out as Holden shrugs at Hooper, who is tending bar in a club where people are mingling, a band is playing, and it's loud. The guy sips his drink, and Holden enters to see on the dance floor, amidst a thrall of people, Alyssa dancing like a cat and looking very sexy. Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare off camera as Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit, with Banky looking around.",
    "1350": "A soldier hurries off as Joe leads the group, and they pause to look back at the neighborhood under fire, with houses being destroyed as collateral damage. An explosion hits too close, causing the boys to scream and run between houses, tracked by explosions with varying proximity. They make it to a back door, enter a house, and take cover, silhouetted by explosion light from the windows. Out of breath, they find themselves in a strange kitchen when a loud explosion makes the light fixtures sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter just as another loud blast occurs, accompanied by the sound of glass breaking and a creature roaring, visible in silhouette moving past the bay window, leading Joe to realize that the creature's presence coincides with the blasts. Joe runs, and the others follow, but as they reach the living room, a huge explosion blows out a wall, causing them all to fall, with Martin's leg ripped by concrete. Blood shows that Martin is in real pain, prompting Charles to use the tie from the curtains to fashion a tourniquet, which he wraps tightly around Martin's leg. Charles looks at Martin, cannot argue, and nods at Joe, who looks to Cary as Martin screams. Joe and Cary then run through the devastated neighborhood, past shattered houses and obliterated cars, the only figures in town. They stop at the graves, out of breath, and then run through the graveyard to a series of garage doors, trying the first with windows caked with dirt, then the second door, and finally a locked barn door. Together, they kick the door repeatedly until it opens, revealing a shed with a floor that drops forty feet down, with dirt piled along the sides. Catching their breath, Cary opens his backpack and takes out a Fourth of July sparkler.",
    "94": "Jerry stares at her and then explodes, getting angrily off his feet. He yanks his parka from a hook behind the opened door, grabs a pair of galoshes, and stamps out the door. Marge stares, and after a long moment, her stare breaks as she pulls a clipboard toward her that holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation. She glances idly around the office, noticing another picture of Jean. Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason at the ceiling, and then idly around again. Her look abruptly locks as Jerry makes a left turn into traffic and she grabs the phone to punch in a number. Grimsrud says nothing as, disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door. We pull Carl as he walks toward the car, and behind him, we see the cabin door opening. Carl turns, reacting to the sound, as Grimsrud bounds out wearing mittens and a red hunter's cap but no overcoat, holding an axe. Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the axe in Carl's neck. In her cruiser, on her two-way radio, we hear Lou's voice, heavily filtered. The approach slows as they near a short driveway leading down to a cabin with a brown Cutlass Ciera parked in front. Grimsrud stares, conscious of the noise, as she shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia. With a quick twist, Grimsrud reaches back for the log, hurls it at Marge, and then starts running away. Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself, as Grimsrud pants up the hill, moving slowly through the deep snow. Behind him, Grimsrud, with cheeks sunk and eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road. She glances up in the rear-view mirror to see Grimsrud's head bobbing with bumps on the road, otherwise motionless and scowling as he gazes out. Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself and glances up in the rear-view mirror again at Grimsrud's hollow eyes staring out. Marge pulls over and leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities. Outside, it is snowing, with the sky, earth, and road all white. She stares forward, shakes her head as a squad car with gum-balls spinning punches through the white, approaches in slow motion, followed by an ambulance and another squad car. These vehicles stand next to a highway on a snowy, windswept plain, with one or two cars dotting the parking lot alongside an idling police cruiser. We look over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen standing on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms. One of them raps at the door, and then upholsters his gun, nodding to someone whose back enters.",
    "415": "Mrs. Robinson is sitting there, and Mr. Robinson exits. Ben and Elaine are then shot in Ben's car, seen from the back, as Ben pushes the car recklessly in and out of traffic, leaning on the horn. The car ahead does not move, so Ben swerves around it, jamming his horn and giving the other driver an angry look as Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance. Ben and Elaine sit at a table, with Elaine having her back to the stage, folding her hands and looking down, while their chairs are angled so Ben can look at the stage without looking directly at her. The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses, down to a tasseled bra and g-string, twirling the tassels. Elaine turns to look at the stripper and then turns back. Elaine leans against a building, pulling her arm away as Ben, facing her, moves from side to side, trying to get her attention while she looks away and starts to cry. Onlookers on the sidewalk watch, prompting Elaine to turn away from them, and Ben moves in front of her. She brings her hands to her face, and Ben looks at her in agony before pulling her wrists away, leading her to look up startled before he kisses her. She closes her eyes as he frees her hands, which then move to his wrists. After a while, she pulls away and turns slightly as he looks at her and she watches him carefully. A couple of teenagers drive up next to them with a radio loudly playing rock and roll. Ben leans across Elaine, speaks to the kid behind the wheel, who turns the radio up. Ben and Elaine roll their windows up and talk animatedly while eating, with Elaine watching as Ben tells her a story.",
    "477": "Salieri sits at his desk, which is littered with manuscripts. In the middle stands a billiard table, and the beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro, \"Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi,\" plays in the background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart dreamily hears the music while playing shots on the table. From time to time, he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. He is in his own world of composition, with the billiard balls aiding his creativity. Mozart comes out, and framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid noticed in Salieri's house. From his bedroom, Leopold peeps out to watch. Mozart goes to the girl, then Constanze follows. The old man emerges from his bedroom, and Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl. Lorl goes outside and closes the door. Constanze turns on Leopold, and a hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. On its finger is the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri, who hands her a pile of coins. She accepts them, delighted. To lively music, the door of the house bursts open, and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out by six men who run off with it down the street. Immediately, Wolfgang, Constanze, and Leopold, all dressed for an occasion, climb into a waiting carriage that drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight, then she shuts the door and hurries off in the opposite direction. An outdoor concert is being given where Mozart is playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. A sizable audience listens to him, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten. The crowd is happy and appreciative in a delightful open-air scene. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his work brilliantly. A carriage clops through the streets with Lorl sitting up on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, the figure of Salieri is glimpsed. Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood as Lorl opens the door, admitting Salieri. They go in, and the door shuts. The room is considerably tidier due to Lorl's ministrations. Salieri stands looking around with tremendous curiosity as she opens a drawer in a sideboard where we see a gold snuff box, the one presented to Mozart as a child in the Vatican. Salieri turns to look around as she points across the room to the workroom, where Salieri crosses alone.",
    "705": "Harry banks around and sees Peter swinging between the buildings. He zooms down after Peter, who swings into a narrow gap between the tall buildings, propelling himself along from thread to thread. Harry turns the Sky Stick side on so he can fly along the narrow gap, dodging fire escapes and air con units as he air boards after Peter. Harry pulls a glowing green sword from a scabbard on his back and slashes wildly at Peter, who swerves out of the way. Harry soars above Peter, then plummets down to stab him but misses. Harry hurls a small, golden pumpkin bomb at Peter. It opens up in mid-air into a kind of flying metallic bat. Harry throws more bombs at Peter. They slash at Peter who desperately tries to swing out of their way. He jumps off a pipe and swings back the way he came, just missing Harry. The winged bombs surge after Peter and Harry gets caught in the swarm. One of them embeds its wing in his shoulder. He yanks it out, zooms upwards into the air, and swoops on after Peter. Peter swings backwards, shooting webbing at the bombs and disabling them. One of them is caught in a thread, and Peter swings it back at Harry. Harry flies through the explosion, shielding his eyes. He hits the line of thread stretched out in front of him and bounces off a pipe and a wall, tumbling towards an alleyway below. Peter, his eyes widening with alarm, swings down towards him. Harry lies motionless on the ground. Peter hurries over to his unconscious old friend. He crouches down and holds his ear to Harry's mouth. He yanks open Harry's dark green jacket and starts pumping his chest. He listens again for signs of life. He carries his friend to an emergency room. Peter watches through a window as a crash team tries to revive Harry. A detective hands a file to tall, thin-faced Captain Stacy. A police dog handler blows a whistle and points. Flint sprints across waste ground with armed officers running behind him. As he reaches a wire mesh fence an Alsatian lunges at him. He wrestles the dog off and punches it away. Flint climbs. Flint runs on and suddenly falls into a huge pit. He tumbles down a concrete wall and lands heavily on a pile of sand in the bottom of the pit. Slowly, he hauls himself to his feet and looks desperately from side to side. He's caught in a dazzling beam of light. Above the pit, three glowing capacitors begin to rotate like a merry-go-round. Flint looks up nervously as the capacitors descend towards him and spin around him. They kick up a sandstorm with Flint trapped in the middle.",
    "208": "A young man examines an assortment of luggage, and as the camera draws closer, he turns, revealing George as a young man. Suddenly, as George stands with his arms outstretched, the picture freezes and becomes a still, and voices from Heaven are heard. The closeup of George resumes as he retrieves a large suitcase from under the counter. The setting, now filled with school kids having sodas, features a juke box and many little tables, with three kids working behind the counter. When George enters, Gower, now sober, shaven, and good-humored, sees him and his face lights up. George notices an old cigar lighter on the counter, closes his eyes, makes a wish, and as he snaps it, a flame appears. George crosses the street, observed by Uncle Billy, cousin Tilly, and cousin Eustace from a second-floor window of the Building and Loan offices. Bert opens the cab and places George's suitcase inside. As George is about to enter the cab, he pauses upon seeing Violet approach, who captures attention with her walk and figure. Violet gives George a sultry look, and as she passes by George and Bert, they raise their heads above the cab. Ernie sticks his head out from the driver's seat, and as Violet crosses the street, an elderly man, distracted by her, is nearly hit by a car with screeching brakes. Bert checks his watch, then glances at Violet's retreating figure. Pop Bailey sits at the dinner table, while sounds of banging and scuffling come from upstairs. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the cook, look toward the vibrating ceiling, and Annie pounds on it with a broom. Pop smiles while poking his plate, and Mrs. Bailey calls up the stairs and then ascends them. A commotion follows as the boys mimic fanfare music and bring their mother down, carrying her high and gracefully setting her in Pop's lap. Pop kisses her, and she quickly hugs him before scolding the boys with wrath. Annie crosses the room with her broom, and Harry reaches for her, pushing her through the kitchen door and playfully slapping her bottom.",
    "323": "Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway, throwing the Fellowship into pitch blackness. A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, casting a glow across the old wizard's face. The Fellowship crosses a precarious bridge above deep mine workings and continues up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery where the graves are despoiled, with dwarf skeletons strewn about and goblin graffiti scrawled on monuments in dried dwarf blood. The atmosphere is very sinister. The path splits into three passages, each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning, and the Fellowship nervously waits while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the three tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance. There is a sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. Frodo, feeling nervous, approaches Gandalf, and an emaciated, leering creature blazes like a silent flash of lightning. Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously and stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced armored skeleton tumbling in. Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin, and they fall silent. Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt, and Frodo looks down to see a cold blue glow emanating from Sting's scabbard. Frodo draws the sword and stares at its glowing blade. Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something and turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes. Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. Suddenly, the door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll. Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his axes in two goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of goblins with their swords, while Legolas fires deadly arrows into goblin throats, desperately trying to shield the hobbits. Gandalf, clutching his sword, joins in the battle. The cave troll sweeps his club at Aragorn, who stumbles backwards. The huge club descends for the killing blow, but in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the scaly arm of the troll, which rears back, spewing green blood. Sam backs up against a wall, a sword in one hand and a saucepan in the other. In desperation, he swings wildly at a goblin with the saucepan, and it keels over. Surprised, Sam wallops another goblin, and it too drops. The cave troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear. Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall, causing the hobbits to go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down, while Merry and Pippin jump on him. Legolas fires an arrow, and the cave troll topples dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor, appearing to be dead.",
    "200": "George is seated at the bar, having had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to, and the camera moves closer to him as he mumbles. Nick, the bartender, watches him solicitously, while Martini comes over to his side. George shakes his head, and on the other side of him, a burly individual drinks a glass of beer before suddenly throwing a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick, and several others rush to pick George up. Mr. Welch reaches into his pocket for money, but Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding as he starts for the door, and although Nick and Martini try to stop him, he shrugs them off, opens the door, and exits to the street. George's car comes along the empty street through the falling snow, swerves suddenly, and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house. George gets out to look at the damage and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out, observing that the front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands unsteadily by the car, shaken by the accident, and dully looks at the damage as the owner examines the damages. George then staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man, and crosses the approach to the bridge as a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him. The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing, stopping at the center of the bridge as snow falls hard. He looks down at the water, dotted with floating ice, trying to make up his mind to act, and leans over, fascinated, glancing furtively around as though about to jump. Suddenly, from above, a body hurtles past George and lands in the water with a loud splash. Horrified, George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water. George surfaces, sees the man flailing about, and swims toward him. The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, runs out on the bridge with a flashlight and shines it on the two figures struggling in the water below. George reaches the man, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.",
    "235": "Szpilman and the German Captain enter through another set of doors, and the German Captain's boots echo as they come into a spacious room with faint moonlight filtering through the large windows, amidst fallen masonry and broken glass. In the room, there are a couple of chairs and a grand piano in the corner. The German Captain points at the piano, and Szpilman hesitates before limping to it, putting down the tin, and opening the lid. He turns, drags over one of the chairs, and sits as the German Captain stands and watches. Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, then plays Chopin while the German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale moonlight reveals the German Captain to be a handsome, elegant man. After Szpilman finishes playing, the German Captain stares at him, and a moment passes. Szpilman nods, just stares at him, then hesitates, takes the tin, and shuffles past the German Captain towards the door. The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees a ladder leading up to the loft, and Szpilman climbs it, squeezes into the loft, and looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on him. Szpilman shows him the tin before quickly going. Szpilman opens the package, finding bread and marmalade, and then finds a tin-opener. Snow falls as the Germans evacuate the villa; men carry out boxes, filing cabinets, desks, papers, and load them into trucks. Szpilman opens the trapdoor to see the German Captain in the attic, carrying a package, and Szpilman faces him as the Captain hands him the package, which Szpilman opens to find several loaves of bread inside. Szpilman shivers with cold, and the German Captain takes off his coat and gives it to him. In the freezing weather with empty streets, Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the eiderdown, hears the strange sound of recorded music, recognizing the Polish national anthem as a car with a loudspeaker and Polish national flag comes into view. Astonished and puzzled, he comes to a decision and starts to leave, cautiously trotting down the staircase into the empty hall in his German military overcoat. He goes to the front door, opens it a crack, and cautiously goes out, looking around and hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly. Hearing the commotion, a woman runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen, as does a man. Szpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him. Szpilman runs while the firing continues, and he bolts into the doorway of a ruined building, peers out, and sees Polish soldiers beginning to surround the building, firing shots and lobbing a grenade or two. Two of the Polish officers stand near the entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts.",
    "1293": "She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach, while in the background, Keith the teacher is talking to some science kids, sporting a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily. Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker as Juno marches up to him, belly leading the way, clearly affronted. A girl, obviously Katrina, strides past with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno. Juno starts to walk away, picking up her backpack dejectedly and sliding it over her shoulder, but she's about to walk away when she climbs ungracefully into the van. Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website, with a blank expression of a bored obsessive. He breaks into a grin and opens the door as Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up, holding a stack of CDs. He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house, where the Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered, unfinished, and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb as Juno examines the comic. There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. Juno mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly, then they sway slowly to the music until Juno's belly bumps up against Mark. Juno rests her head on Mark's chest and they dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving. Juno backs away, and Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is—a teenage girl. Juno turns to leave and shoots one furious look back at Mark. She reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased nursing pillow. It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. She rushes toward the door, then halts, looking totally betrayed. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying, and as Juno's face continues to fall, Vanessa notices, sighs, and looks defeated. Vanessa and Mark notice that Juno has escaped the conflict as Juno runs up to her car sobbing, and it's quiet after the storm. Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant. Meanwhile, Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar, playing a theme that we will soon recognize. Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. After a beat, she begins to gather herself, hops off the hood, and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled-up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something.",
    "69": "VERONICA stands, letting DANTE'S head hit the floor, as a handsome young man named WILLAM is standing at the counter, prompting VERONICA to react to him. There's a moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension, after which DANTE waits on a customer in the interim. Meanwhile, VERONICA counts silently, using fingers as marks, then stops counting. DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door, but she exits in a huff and violently lets go of him as she leaves. VERONICA went, and then DANTE swings the door open and yells out. Two men walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in that direction, leaving DANTE standing in silence for a moment. A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp, as it's twenty after and he should be here soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE, who studies a copy of Paradise Lost, trying not to notice the glare. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms out, and DANTE lifts a ring of keys from the counter, which are half-swallowed by the trash can. A hapless RANDAL drifts by, stops, glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug before walking away. Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store door, as the VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up and stops RANDAL, after which a pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter with a single key on top, and RANDAL marches off. RANDAL balances the pile of tapes on his head, as the IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground next to the video store door, while RANDAL balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as RANDAL enters the store, and the door closes behind him, only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later. RANDAL smiles, indicating we've seen this same routine before. A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it, as DANTE crosses back to his post, and RANDAL enters, tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He picks the cat up, walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it, holding a list in his hand. DANTE sits in his seat behind the register, while RANDAL grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter. The headline of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO, as RANDAL dials the phone and a CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the litter box, where a black cat suddenly jumps in and starts pawing around. The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load.",
    "1292": "Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks, and gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly. Mark looks jolted, realizing for the first time that her baby might have a father, then swivels around slowly on his desk chair, surprised. He walks over to his music collections, starts pulling CDs, and mouths along with the lyrics. Juno spots a VHS tape on the coffee table, picks it up, and sees some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore before a door suddenly slams upstairs, causing her to jump up and rush out. Meanwhile, Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worst-case scenarios, holding the ultrasound up to show Vanessa and draping her arm around her as Juno glances at Mark and then at Vanessa. A beat passes as Bren absorbs this scene. Juno heads to the urn by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into it. Outside, Juno parks her Previa on the street and is greeted by Bleeker's mom, who answers the door visibly annoyed and lets her eyes drift down to Juno's middle. Bleeker also glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed, but then smiles faintly as he nervously cracks open a container of orange Tic-Tacs and pours them into his mouth. Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker, and he is visibly relieved but still picks at the carpet, dejected. Meanwhile, the house is covered in fresh snow, and the walls are primed slate gray as Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall, while Mark stares at the wall, looking lost. Later, Juno and Leah are walking through the mall looking bored, and Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear while Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel. Juno wrestles Leah for the pretzel as onlookers stare, appalled, when Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson. They watch a group of well-heeled women and their children shopping en masse, among them Vanessa, looking vaguely detached. They continue to watch Vanessa for a few more moments as the other kids wander toward the play area while their mothers ignore them, and Vanessa continues to entertain the children. Juno tries her best to look enthused while Vanessa admires her belly and Juno grimaces, grabbing Vanessa's hand and planting it on her stomach. Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby, but looks like she's giving up hope, kneeling down next to the swell of Juno's belly. Mark drops his head, dejected, but then instantly smiles and continues to smile. In the school cafeteria, Juno's tray slides along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food, and she and Leah walk their trays to a table. They sit inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch as Juno notices the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way.",
    "1037": "A bright white light shines in front of a cloudy sky, held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long white robe with a blue sash draped around her. Silver metallic letters on a black background are seen, and framed within a V shape is a city skyline. A motorcade sweeps through the city streets, with motorcycles in the background. Men in suits climb stairs as the motorcade moves past a tall stone bell tower towards the flashing lights of a parked police car, with a GNN TV camera fixed on the vehicles. The convoy comes to a halt, cameras flash, and the President, a tall man with a receding hairline, emerges. He and his guards move away from the car, with one of the Secret Service agents, Barnes, a man in his 50s with a furrowed brow, glancing all around, scanning rooftops and the protesters as he walks ahead of the President. On a preview monitor, the GNN gallery crew watch footage of an assassination attempt on President Ashton, during which Barnes takes the bullets for the President, and the President is hustled to safety and recoils. A bomb goes off in the plaza, smoke erupts from the explosion and blanks out the TV cameras, covering the plaza in its dense blanket. The gallery is stunned, and as the smoke clears, the director catches sight of Angie lying on the ground with blood on her forehead and chest among the rubble. The picture constantly breaks up, and the director and her assistant fight back tears. Director Rex Brooks, in her 40s, gets to her feet and switches off the feed. Haggard and weary, she sits back down by her younger, weeping PA. The events rewind to pre-explosion, with Angie reporting and the President at the lectern, and the motorcade en route to the plaza. Agent Barnes, his torso bare, turns from his window, nods to his colleague Ken Taylor, then turns back to gaze out as he puts on a shirt, revealing a scar on his back. Barnes strolls across the room, sits down on his bed with a tie in his hand, fastens his shirt, and reaches for a pill bottle. Popping the lid, he tips the bottle, puts his hand to his grimacing face, seeing footage of the previous year's assassination attempt where he falls to the ground. In the hotel room, Barnes places the pill back in the bottle on the bedside cabinet, lifts his gun from the cabinet, and checks its magazine. In a hotel corridor, Barnes puts on his jacket while walking in front of a large window against which he is silhouetted.",
    "506": "Thelma hops in quickly as Louise careens back onto the road and slams on the brakes. Louise stops yelling for a moment, groping for self-control, while Thelma looks pitiful. The T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route as Louise passes a man who honks at them. They look up to see him pointing wildly to his lap, prompting Thelma to laugh wildly. Thelma transitions from laughing to crying, and they both get quiet. Thelma leans back, just watching Louise and studying her as if she's never really seen her before. Suddenly, a look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face, and she jerks upright, startling Louise. Louise understands what Thelma is talking about and becomes immediately agitated, looking as if she wants to flee. Her eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma appears completely serene. The car is screaming down the road as they drive through a small group of buildings. A car speeds up to catch them, and red and blue lights pop on, revealing it as a New Mexico State Patrol car. Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror, and Thelma jumps awake as they try not to panic. The patrol car is right behind them as Louise pulls off the road and the patrol car pulls up behind them, shining its lights brightly through the windows. A patrolman gets out and approaches their car, coming to the driver's side window where Louise smiles up at him. She fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it, and shows her license. They walk to the back of the car, and he notes the license plate number before getting into the driver’s side and picking up a clipboard to clip Louise's license to it. As he picks up the hand mike for the radio, Thelma appears with a gun at his head, and he drops it. Louise reaches over, takes his gun, and shoots the car radio, flinching at each shot. Louise fires two more shots into the police radio, destroying it, and then takes the keys and her license from the clipboard before getting out and trotting around to the back of the car. Thelma holds the gun on the patrolman, then suddenly fires twice into the trunk cover. Louise opens the trunk, and as the patrolman climbs in, Thelma explains to Louise. They find themselves in really beautiful country, while elsewhere, a cop walks into a kitchen and hands Hal a file labeled Louise Elizabeth Sawyer.",
    "1373": "Harry, Ron, and Hermione are seated on a train when suddenly they are fired on, and Arthur and others approach. The lady appears at their door, and Ron sees he hasn't enough money as Cho Chan walks up to the trolley. Harry and Cho look at each other and smile. Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head. Four flying horses pulling a carriage land at Hogwarts, and the crowds cheer. A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too. A man runs up the aisle limping comically, whispers to Dumbledore, and leaves the same way. A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release butterflies, bow, and everyone applauds. A series of older boys walk up the aisle, brandishing bo staffs with sparks, and breathe fire. They embrace. The man seated next to Hagrid yelps when Hagrid stabs a fork into his hand. A strange man stands in the doorway, casts magic upwards to seal the roof, and peace is restored. This character enters the room and begins walking, seeing Harry through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as the crowd is unsettled and booing. Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing a blue flame. A suspicious character enters the room where the goblet burns and closes the door. He writes his name on the board as Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger, pops open a jar with a spider, and uses his wand to send it around the class, unsettling them. Draco laughs, and Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face. Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, and it's wriggling as Neville Longbottom stands. Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals, and Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed, and Mad-Eye picks up the spider, which is still making a noise. Hermione shakes her head as Mad-Eye casts a spell and the spider disintegrates. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink. They see a boy on the stairs facing the window, and Mad-Eye approaches Neville, patting him on the shoulder. Neville nods. Older students place their names into the flame, and others applaud, with Cedric among them. The twins come up cheering, jump inside the age line, do a high-five after putting their names into the flame, but are flung across the room when the flame fires up. When they get up, they have full heads of grey hair and beards.",
    "1385": "A glimmering puddle is omitted as a carriage wheel shatters the glassy surface, revealing a procession of horseless carriages carrying students toward the castle. The sweet sound of a choir rises as lightning flashes across the night sky, transitioning the scene to the Great Hall. The camera glides toward the windows, passing through the glass to reveal candlelit silhouettes. At the High Table sit Lupin, Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid, and Albus Dumbledore. The camera tracks along the choir, singing with a harpsichord, and lands on a quintet of toads, including Neville Longbottom's toad, Trevor. As the choir concludes, Dumbledore stands, beaming. Amid scattered applause, Harry, Ron, and Hermione clap, then applaud vigorously after exchanging stunned looks. Hagrid turns ruby red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table. At the Slytherin table, Draco Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle, feigns a dead faint at Harry, who makes eye contact. Students exit the Great Hall and scale the Marble Staircase. Harry, Ron, and Hermione reach the seventh floor landing and approach the Fat Lady in the portrait. Ron spins and frowns at Hermione. Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and grasps, causing everyone to turn and see Lavender bent over her textbook. Harry peers into his cup, watching the tea leaves shift. The trio emerges from the bridge and heads toward Hagrid's hut, where students have gathered. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the Slytherins, and though there is no consensus, students stare in wary wonder as Hagrid coaxes a beast to the paddock's center. Ron stares uneasily as the class steps back, leaving Harry in front. Unsure, Harry nods, steps forward, and bows. Buckbeak studies Harry and ducks his beak, prompting a relieved sigh from Hagrid. Tentatively, Harry lays his hand on Buckbeak's beak, and the class claps as Harry smiles. Hagrid lifts Harry onto Buckbeak's back and slaps its hindquarters. Buckbeak's talons slash down, and Malfoy freezes, noticing blood on his robes and shrieks. Harry dashes forward, and Buckbeak, upon seeing Harry, lowers its talons and ducks its beak. Meanwhile, Harry, Ron, and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table and turn to see Seamus and other Gryffindors huddled over a copy of The Daily Prophet.",
    "1171": "The professors rise to their feet as a Slytherin chaser tosses the Quaffle into the air and fixes it through the goal with his broomstick. Hovering high above the pitch, Harry follows the game anxiously. Suddenly, the Golden Snitch swoops past, and Harry speeds after it, dodging the Bludgers aimed for his head. His broomstick goes out of control, shaking him violently from side to side and spinning him over and over. Through her binoculars, Hermione spots Snape in the professors' grand stand with his lips moving, and she gives her binoculars to Ron. Harry clings desperately to the bucking broomstick, which spins him off, but he manages to grab the handle and hang underneath, holding on with only one hand as Malfoy and his cronies cheer. Snape is still muttering to himself as Harry grabs the broomstick with both hands, which swings him backward and forward, trying to shake him off. Ron watches through the binoculars as Hermione reaches the professors' grand stand and races up the stairs, where Snape continues muttering. She pulls out her wand and, crawling beneath the seats, gives it a flick, smiling as a flame appears and Snape's cloak starts to burn. The professors beat out the flames, knocking Quirrell off his feet, and Harry's broomstick suddenly calms down. Quirrell and Snape put out the fire and watch as Harry manages to regain control of the Nimbus 2000. He climbs onto the broomstick and zooms off to the Slytherin seeker, who is close behind the Snitch. They fly shoulder to shoulder as the crafty Slytherin barges Harry, trying to knock him out of the way, but Harry circles round and then comes back, with the Slytherin bully barging him again. The Snitch flips from tower to tower, suddenly changing its course and heading straight for the ground. The two seekers follow, but the cowardly Slytherin pulls out at the last moment as they plummet headfirst. The Snitch levels out, skimming low along the ground, and standing precariously on the broomstick, Harry stretches out his hand to catch the Snitch. He takes a step forward, and the broom tips up, sending him somersaulting over onto the grass. He scrambles up, clutching his stomach with both hands as his friends watch with concern. Hagrid peers through the binoculars as Harry spits out the Snitch. As Madam Hooch declares the winner, the Gryffindors leap for joy, with giant Hagrid punching the air victoriously and Hermione shrieking at the top of her voice. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall applaud enthusiastically, while Snape remains in his seat, expressionless. Standing in the middle of the arena in his scarlet and gold cloak, Harry beams with pride and pleasure. As his teammates swoop around the arena on their broomsticks, celebrating their success, Harry holds the fluttering Golden Snitch triumphantly above his head and slowly turns, displaying his prize to his ecstatic supporters.",
    "142": "Nehru waits for Gandhi and rises when Gandhi enters. The guard signals Gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table from Nehru, and the guard closes the door but remains in the room. Nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a small smile of greeting. Gandhi, who also looks worn, raises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name, then sighs as their faces and minds go to more somber matters. Gandhi listens to it all with a growing sense of despair. The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen, shimmering, accompanied by the sound of a car and marching feet. The camera pulls back from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees, and then, suddenly, the face of General Dyer, blunt, cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness. He is traveling slowly and steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys — Gurkhas and Baluchis — who are immaculate, precise, and awesome. Behind them, a staff car with Dyer's English ADC and a British police officer follows. It is a relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding. In a large public garden, enclosed by a thick, old, crumbling wall, a large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park. The event is political, but the crowd is mixed with Muslims, Hindus, many Sikhs, old men, little children, and women with babes in arms. The camera closes in on the speaker, a Muslim, who clutches a copy of Gandhi's journal. General Dyer, with his armored car and sepoys, moves toward the gate. Dyer looks ahead calmly toward the Gate of the Bagh, a rickety double gate in the high crumbling wall. Nearer the gate, a few vendors, loiterers, and children turn in curiosity at the sound of the armored car and marching feet. The armored car grinds forward but can't go through the gates, with one fender scraping against the gate post. Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away, and he jumps down lightly, a man in splendid condition. He walks through the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands clasping his swagger stick behind his back, looking off at the speaker. In a medium shot, the sepoys and Dyer are seen. He issues commands in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on maneuvers. A ripple of panic ensues, with everyone pressing back, though they cannot believe what they see. Only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter. In a close shot, Dyer remains calm, and in a flash shot along the line of sepoys, the rifles jerk and bang.",
    "1236": "Ben stirs and sits up as a doctor enters. Dr. Briar sits on Emily's bed, and Emily nods as Dr. Briar hands her the pager. Emily takes a deep breath and looks down while Dr. Briar strokes her hair, gives her a reassuring smile, and leaves. Tears roll down Emily's cheeks as she puts a hand to her mouth and takes Ben's hand. Ben looks on sorrowfully as Emily presses the back of his hand against her forehead and weeps. Ben walks Duke on a lead past the Travel Inn reception; Larry sees them and comes out after them. Ben enters his room, leaving long-haired Larry outside looking indignant. Inside, a small fish swims up into the tentacles of the box jellyfish in Ben's aquarium, becomes partially paralyzed, and is drawn toward the jellyfish's body. Ben sits on his motel bed, watching, and slowly reaches for his mobile beside him. Connie's face is bruised as Ben hands her an envelope, which Connie accepts, nodding. They sleep in the back of her car, and later, a calm Connie drives along the coast road with the children still asleep. She heads down the leafy drive to Ben's beach house, pulls up, and looks awestruck. Connie tentatively enters the house with the children, standing in the doorway for a moment before the girl sets off to look about, only to be pulled back by Connie. The kids run to a window to look out, and then Connie and the kids enter a bedroom, looking around in wonder before jumping up and down on the bed. Mother and children run along the deserted, sunny beach. Inside the house, curtains sway in the breeze while Connie sits reading a letter, considering it with her long, dark hair tied back. Looking overwhelmed, Connie puts her hands to her mouth, holds a pen, hovers it over a document, and then signs it before looking out over the ocean, silhouetted against hazy, golden light. Ben escorts Emily, as a nurse pushes her out of the hospital in a wheelchair, to his car where he opens the door for Emily, with Duke in the back, and fastens her seat belt. Emily grins while Ben stares ahead. She gazes at him and smiles, then lightly nibbles her nails. Ben pulls up and turns to her awkwardly, his eyes darting about as he thinks before eyeing her firmly. Emily stares at him puzzled, studying him through slightly narrowed eyes, before staring at him expectantly, opening her eyes wide, and furrowing her brows. Ben meets her gaze blankly as Emily looks down, considers, and then undoes her seat belt, shoots him a disdainful look, and gets out.",
    "366": "Suddenly, everything rushes, and the crowd becomes a blur, causing a young woman to be lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's frozen, helpless in time, as he checks in windows while cars pull out, searching for his fated love. Colossus is thumbing for a ride, and the last pickup truck stops to let him climb in back. As the truck pulls away, it passes a dejected Edward who believes he'll never find the girl, the love of his life. Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back and spots Edward walking back into the tent. Amos hands off the contract to a clown, and as Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him, pointing to the bleachers where no backpack is to be found. Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him, and Amos smiles, amused. Amos takes a long look at Edward, and ultimately, there's no way he can say no, so he shrugs, and Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. We move into a montage, where Edward is shown smiling nervously, his head tilted to the side, with it held in a massive lion's open mouth, whose sharp teeth are just poking his skin. If the lion flinches, Edward's life is in danger. The crowd applauds, making the lion antsy, which makes Edward even antsier. With his eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride and nods off, falling backward into the path of the spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air. Amos is walking past, stops, looks at the young man, and then finally walks away. We push in on Edward, enraptured by the concept. Edward shovels manure in the nastiest stables, preoccupied with his thoughts. In quiet reverie, he ponders his latest bit of information. A sudden explosion occurs as Edward is shot out of a giant cannon. Under a full moon, Edward walks up to a battered camper and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking significantly. Yet, Edward knocks anyway, and the rocking and moaning suddenly stop. A beat later, the door handle begins to rattle, seeming stuck. Edward turns the knob, and the door bursts open, knocking him down with a massive black dog, the biggest anyone has ever seen, with green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue. Edward wrestles with the beast as its mouth snaps at his throat. Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature’s hands—holding tight instead of paws—prevent him.",
    "180": "Laurie comes back downstairs, takes a key out of her purse, and steps to the window, then to the front door, putting the key to the Doyle house in her pocket. She locks the Doyle house and walks away into the street. The camera moves toward the Wallace house, which is dark and ominous. The wind whips her clothes and hair as she moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind. Bob's car sits on the street. She picks up her speed, moving up the sidewalk as the house looms closer. The camera moves to the front of the Wallace house as Laurie walks up to the front porch, knocks on the door, and rings the doorbell. She stands there, listening for any sound from inside, and waits a moment. Laurie thinks and looks to the street, then steps off the porch and walks to the side of the house, the camera tracking with her. She turns and walks through the breezeway between the house and garage to the back door, pulls it open, and steps into the house, standing there for a moment staring into the blackness of the dark kitchen. Laurie searches for the wall light and looks again into the darkness. A sound from upstairs, like dragging across the floor, stops abruptly. Laurie moves to the head of the staircase and slowly starts up, with the camera tracking her ascent. As she reaches the top and stops, she sees the bedroom door at the end of the hall with faint orange light around its edges. She moves toward the door, the camera tracking with her, and reaches it. The door swings open to reveal a Jack-O-Lantern casting an eerie glow around the room. Someone is lying on the bed, but Laurie can't see them from her position. She moves forward and sees Annie on the bed, with her face a chalky white and a huge red gash across her throat. Laurie stares and screams at the top of her lungs, jumping back to the door. Strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling is Bob, eyes open and staring, causing Laurie to shrink back into a dark corner. Suddenly, a door next to her slowly opens to reveal Lynda standing there, propped up by a chair, staring with glazed, dead eyes. Laurie backs out of the bedroom, her mouth open in speechless horror.",
    "592": "The figure is tall with a thin face and beard. He stops and smiles menacingly. Harry appears behind Ginny and raises his wand. Greyback deflects the spell. He flies up in a spiral of black smoke. Ginny and Harry turn in circles, but can see no sign of him. They take refuge on a small island of sand. Bellatrix spots them. Remus and Tonks are still searching. On their tiny island, Ginny and Harry fend off attacks with their wands. Tonks, Remus, and Mr. Weasley join them on the island. They form a circle, back-to-back, wands poised. Bellatrix watches them. Greyback glances at Bellatrix. They change form, and shoot into the sky, the cloud of black spell. They attack the Weasley house, which bursts into flames. Mr. Weasley sprints off. He finds his family safe, watching their house burn. He puts an arm around his wife. The others join them. And they all watch helplessly, as the Weasley house is engulfed in flames. Lavender puts a heart pendant round Ron's neck. Hermione watches Lavender simpering over Ron. She heads back the way they came. Harry nods to Ron, then walks along the corridor. Lavender leaps on Ron's back and he staggers away with her. Professor Dumbledore's cabinet of vials. Harry plunges his face into the pensive. Teenage Tom Riddle at a Slughorn tea party. Slughorn smiles uneasily. Tom taps the hourglass. The memory stops. Harry straightens up. Dumbledore dips his hand into the pensive. Harry stands solemnly in front of Dumbledore, and nods. The Potions class leave. Slughorn turns and sees Harry. Slughorn shifts uneasily. On his way out, Slughorn stops, spins round and stares at Harry, who doesn't flinch. He stomps out. Slughorn closes the spyhole and locks the door. Harry finds Ron in the boy's dormitory. He's sitting on the floor, gazing dreamily out of the window. Ron holds a gift box. Harry moves away, as Ron leans closer. Ron throws down the box, which has a heart on it. Harry stares at Ron, who smiles inanely, a far away look in his eyes. As Ron sits on the floor and gazes up at the moon, Harry reads the card which came with the chocolates. He grins and crosses to Ron. Little hearts float from it. Ron embraces Slughorn. Harry prises him off. Ron sits on the back of the sofa and falls off. Slughorn gives him a potion. Ron drinks. The inane, fixed smile fades. He looks quizzically up at Harry. He fills three glasses. Ron drinks and collapses, foaming at the mouth. Harry runs to Slughorn's potion cabinet, as Ron convulses on the floor. He puts one in Ron's mouth. He leans over Ron, who lies on his back, no longer breathing.",
    "36": "She can't go on. She lifts her face to his, and he kisses her gently. He looks into her eyes, then he does kiss her as though it were going to be the last time. Her hand falls to the table and knocks over a glass. It's raining very hard at the train station, and there is a hectic, fevered excitement, evident in the faces of the people that pass by. Rick appears in the crowd, stops, puts his suitcase down, and glances at his watch. He nervously checks his watch again, rain pouring over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice. Suddenly Sam appears, pulls an envelope from his pocket, and Rick grabs it, opens it, and stares down at the letter, as raindrops pour down the letter, smudging the writing. Sam pulls a stunned, reluctant Rick to the train, which starts to move just as he boards. From the steps he looks off into the distance, then crumbles the letter and tosses it away as the steam from the engine clouds over him. A close-up of a glass on the table in the cafe is shown, and Rick's hand reaches for it and knocks it over. We now see Rick's face and he's very drunk. Sam walks over to the table to pick up the glass and a fallen chair. Just then the door opens and it's Ilsa. Rick stares at the doorway. Ilsa lingers a moment, then comes over to the table, her manner a little uncertain, a little tentative, but with a quiet determination beneath it. Rick reaches for the bottle, and pours himself another drink. She sits down in the chair before the empty glass, her eyes searching his face, but there is no expression on it except a cold and impassive one. He takes a drink. Ilsa gets up and leaves, and Rick's head slumps over the table. Strasser sits while Renault attends to some paperwork and looks at him. Laszlo and Ilsa make their way through the jam in the lobby of the Prefecture, as Jan and Annina talk to an officer. Laszlo and Ilsa enter Renault's office, and Renault bows to them both. Close-ups of Ilsa and then Laszlo reveal their disappointment, observed by Strasser. Renault rings a buzzer and the door is opened for them. As Ilsa and Laszlo leave, an officer comes in. Signor Ferrari turns around, pleased to see Rick, and they shake hands. He hails a waiter, eyes Rick closely, and Rick looks out of the window and sees Ilsa at the linen bazaar, then Laszlo walking toward the cafe. Rick isn't listening to him, looking through the open window in the direction of the linen bazaar. Rick gets up.",
    "1352": "Cary makes a long, insane pile of firecrackers and uses an open M-80 to lay a squiggly, long line of gunpowder away from the firecrackers and the entrance to the creature's contraption space. As the sparkler dies, light reveals Joe, who slows down and peers around the dirt tunnel bend, now on the other side of the space. He sees the creature and then looks across to the lifeless body of Alice. Cary finishes laying out the charges and pulls out his lighter, but the damn thing won't light. He keeps trying to light it as Joe watches the creature finish its meal and head out. Cary continues to try the lighter frantically. Meanwhile, a woman is catching her breath, nodding, and looking amazed at Joe. She grabs him and hugs him tightly, teary and grateful, but then breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense. Tina, a 24-year-old disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up. Joe and Alice have helped down a familiar face, Sheriff Pruitt, as their survival instinct kicks in despite being out of breath. They follow each other and run into a tunnel, continuing into the darkness. Sparkler lighting the way, Joe and Alice are followed by Pruitt and Tina, all sprinting in the opposite direction. After running hard, Tina is grabbed away into the darkness with screams continuing behind them. They run until they hit a dead end at a dirt wall, out of breath and hesitant to go back toward the horrifying blackness. The only sounds are the sparkler, their erratic breathing, and the silence. Joe and the creature look at each other, and after a long scary beat, the creature sets him down before turning fast and speeding away. Joe, hugged by his father, looks down and finds something moving in his pocket. He pulls out his mother's necklace, which pulls toward the water tower, wanting to go. Joe understands what this means, and in slow motion, holds the necklace up toward the tower with tears in his eyes, not wanting to let go but knowing he must.",
    "871": "She puts up an umbrella as he helps her out, and they climb the spiral staircase inside the building. Nick leans in and kisses Kate full on the lips, and then Nick looks back briefly as he descends the stairs, while Kate grins to herself. In the amber half-light of a darkened room, Kate is fast asleep in bed when the door is ajar, and the hallway light comes on as Zoe slips past the open door clutching a video. Kate stares as she sees Zoe, and wearing pajamas, Kate wanders down the hallway towards a dull, flickering light emanating from the lounge. She pauses outside the open lounge door where Zoe sits on the floor watching a home movie of Christine frolicking on a dull, wind-swept beach. Christine flaps her arms as if pretending to fly as she runs down to the edge of a grey sea. Kate enters the lounge and joins Zoe on the floor; now, the TV screen fills with Christine and Zoe's ecstatically happy faces, and Christine kisses her smiling daughter on the cheek and beams back at the camera. Attractive, long blonde haired Christine throws back her hair and laughs joyously as tears well in Zoe's doleful eyes. Kate looks away from the TV and down at Zoe, putting an arm around her niece, and Zoe leans into Kate as the video plays with Christine running along the beach, waving back at the camera, her jacket and scarf flapping behind her until the grainy video comes to an end. In the morning, Kate and Zoe are in Zoe's bed, lying facing each other, Zoe with her arm on Kate's shoulder as daylight fills the room. Kate watches a sleeping Zoe, who stares, and a smile flickers across Zoe's lips before she closes her eyes again. Kate places an arm around Zoe, and she too closes her eyes. At the restaurant, Bernadette reads a letter. Later, Zoe runs out of her bedroom and down the corridor, chased by Kate, who ambushes her coming out of the lounge. Feathers fly as Kate and Zoe gleefully batter each other with their pillows until Kate pushes Zoe backwards onto the sofa. Exhausted, the pair collapse onto the hall floor, with feathers drifting down around them. At the restaurant, Nick commands a hectic kitchen, and the dining room is packed as Paula and her waiting staff move busily around the tables. Later, Paula and Nick relax with a brandy as Paula eyes Nick with a smile. Kate's fast asleep in bed when she flicks on her bedside lamp, rises, and wearing her dressing gown, answers the intercom. Nick and Kate sit across from each other at a desk in the lamp-lit lounge, where he spoon-feeds the blindfolded Kate some sauce from a container between them, and in the soft glow of the lamp, Nick observes Kate with a smile.",
    "609": "Sydney floors Sophie and springs up to his feet, then runs off as Elena is being restrained while bouncers approach. Sydney stomps Vincent's dark glasses underfoot, causing Vincent to shield his eyes from the light, and Sydney races out of the doorway. Clayton bursts out laughing, then sharply resumes a serious look as Sydney races outside, where his escape is blocked by fans and photographers amassed behind a red rope cordon. Sydney looks defeated until a young guy lifts the cordon, allowing the bespectacled mop-head guy to nod for Sydney to pass, and he does, racing off through the crowd. He approaches a pretty flame-haired flight desk attendant at LAX airport, glares at his mobile, then looks up to see himself on a TV mounted to a pillar nearby, onscreen showing Sophie diving on Sydney and pinning him to a table, with a close-up of them grappling on the floor. He smiles blankly at her, then obliges. Looking bedraggled in his ruffled mess of a suit, Sydney sits alone in the departure lounge, impatiently tapping his hand with his mobile phone, as a burly guy in a yellow baseball cap, grey jacket, and jeans pushes a floor buffer past behind him. Sidney looks at the gold ring in his palm, spiraling his hand around it and staring off, before a yellow taxi drives through the streets with Sydney seated in the back. He looks out through the window to see a La Dolce Vita open-air cinema screening, where people are seated in deck chairs and on blankets, staring up. Sidney searches for Alison in the crowd, and on the screen, a man rides on a woman's back. He staggers around, looking left and right, then stops to stare up a grassy incline, where his face lights up as he sees Alison reclining on a blanket beside a man and a woman. Alison leans in and talks to the man with an air of familiarity, causing Sidney's face to drop and his shoulders to sink, but as the other woman hugs the man and they cozy up together, Sidney's smile returns, and he hurries up the slope towards them. Alison squints up at him, smiles, and he looks around awkwardly as she picks up her notebook and hands it to him. She looks on as he leafs through it, they smile at each other, and he tosses the book down on the blanket and offers a hand. She takes it and rises to her feet, and they stand hand in hand, facing each other, just inches apart. She smiles, and they share a passionate kiss, then kiss again. He secretly takes the ring from his trouser pocket and puts it in the pocket of her floaty, pale blue floral dress, and they share a look before turning to face the screen.",
    "441": "Don's eyes turn slowly toward the door as Helen stands outside, ringing the bell. She bangs on the door, rattling the doorknob helplessly, but still there is no answer and she raps on the door again. Inside, Don sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray his presence, bathed in sweat, with tears of terror in his eyes. He continues staring at the door as Helen turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in her door, peering up, and she hurries to the stairwell and calls down it. Don's eyes are still on the door, now focusing on the door chain. He realizes he's forgotten to put it up, but hopes it's not too late, and with a desperate effort, he flings himself to the floor and starts inching his way to the door. Don is almost at the door when, with his last strength, he raises himself against it, stretches out his hand to get the door chain, tries to slip it in its notch, but misses. Dave, the janitor, with a ring of labelled keys in his hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs. Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. Don tries again, but by this time the door is open, and despite Don throwing all his weight against the door, it is no use. Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway and stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start downstairs. Helen then enters and closes the door behind her. A shaft of light comes from the corridor, and Don crouches behind the door. She kneels down beside Don, and they are beside the light switch. Helen snaps it on and leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained wall as she seats him on the bed and turns on the bed lamp. Don is panting hard, completely oblivious of the fact that Helen is in the room. On the armchair near the kitchen door lies Helen's leopard coat. Helen lies asleep on the couch, using the pillow and the comforter from Wick's bed. In the doorway to the bedroom stands Don, wearing the dark suit he wore to the opera, as his eyes shift from Helen to the coat while he is just tying his tie. Very cautiously, he begins to tiptoe toward the chair. He picks up the leopard coat and starts towards the entrance door. Just as he is slipping out, Don shuts the door behind him. Helen then flings open the door and runs out. In the next second, Helen hurries into the shot, wearing Wick's foulard dressing gown. She runs to the banister and looks down, barefooted, just wearing the foulard dressing gown.",
    "956": "He stumbles and runs back into the shop as something comes after him. It smashes the windows, knocking him to the floor, then grabs him, dragging him back. Next day, Joe is making Alice up as one of the un-dead. Alice gives Joe a questioning look, and she nods pensively. The lights in the room flickered, and Alice adopts a dead-eyed zombie persona, lurching slowly towards Joe. Waving her arms around jerkily, she draws closer and lunges at him, pretending to bite his neck. They regard each other, smiling, and then Alice goes. Charles had been watching them. Jack is at the wrecked gas station with the manager of the station, Eddie. The sheriff's car is missing from the scene, but fragments of its lights remain. On a used car lot, the engines have been stolen from all the cars. Jack watches suspiciously as a convoy of military lorries passes by on the road, and in the back of one, he notes some airmen operating some kind of radio listening device. As dusk approaches, Joe cycles beside a pylon in a field as he looks for his dog. He gets off his bike and looks around. Back in town, Joe cycles up beside a community bulletin board and sticks a flyer on it. As he looks at the board, something strikes him. He takes a step back and sees that the entire board is covered in flyers for lost dogs of all shapes and sizes. Joe returns home to find Jack at the dinner table with his other deputies, Tally, Mina, Rosko, Ross, and Jay. Joe drops a torch, and the cops look round as the lights flicker and Jack gets on his radio. A telecom engineer's truck drives along a dark road. Rooney is working on a power line outside a junkyard from the cherry picker on the back of his truck. A noise emanates from the junkyard, and he looks over at it for a moment, then gets back on with his job. Bits of scrap fly up into the air from the junkyard, and Rooney watches with mounting concern as a huge hunk of junk sails overhead and lands in the road—it's a cooker. Rooney operates the controls for his cherry picker and gets it to raise him higher so that he can get a better view of the junkyard. The activity in the yard appears to have stopped. As he peers into the gloom, Rooney notices the headlights of his truck and the streetlight nearby start to flicker. The cherry picker has stopped working. Something suddenly lunges out of the trees and grabs him, jolting his truck and breaking the windscreen. Jack is addressing a meeting of concerned locals as he glares at Louis, who is being led away by one of the other deputies.",
    "236": "Silence envelops everyone, each locked in their own thoughts. Father, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly along, carrying a string bag with potatoes and carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement, lost in thought. He passes two German officers who stop, causing Father to turn fearfully and approach them. One German officer strikes Father hard across the face, hitting his ear. Father reels, collects himself, and shuffles on, stepping off the pavement to walk in the gutter. Father continues on. Meanwhile, Szpilman is composing at the piano, making adjustments to the manuscript with a pencil and playing again. Halina enters with a newspaper, handing it to him. He looks at it, and his expression darkens at the sight of a map of the proposed Jewish area: two distinct districts, one large, one smaller. Halina looks over his shoulder and reads as Henryk leans in the doorway, watching, seemingly amused. Szpilman gazes at the map, horrified, and laughs nervously. They're disturbed by the sound of crying from another room. Puzzled, they look at each other, and Halina opens a door to find Mother sitting on the bed, holding a purse, crying, while Father sleeps. Halina sits beside Mother, putting an arm around her as Mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note, weeping. Halina tries to comfort her while Szpilman and Henryk watch. Podgy, hairy hands with dirty nails play an octave on the piano, harshly and tonelessly, with straight fingers. The hands belong to Mr. Lipa, a dealer in his early fifties, who sits at the piano, examining the lacquer as Regina stands in the bow, watching him, and Henryk watches intently from the table. Szpilman sits apart, aloof, with his back to the piano and Mr. Lipa. Suddenly, Henryk lunges at Mr. Lipa, grabbing him, and a struggle ensues. During it, Mother and Father appear at their bedroom door, watching, appalled. Henryk subsides, glowering at Mr. Lipa. A great column of Jews of all ages makes its way toward the area that will become the ghetto. They travel on foot, bicycles, and horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with belongings, forming a great moving mass of humanity watched by Poles on either side of the street. On a horse-drawn platform are the Szpilmans with their belongings, all wearing armbands. Szpilman, Halina, and Henryk walk beside the platform where Mother, Father, and Regina are seated. Szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, smiles, and pushes through the crowd to Dorota, who is close to tears.",
    "1326": "Next to a faded diorama of the nativity scene, a man deftly rolls an engraved silver Zippo back and forth over his nicotine-stained fingers. Behind the counter, Percy Walker, a black man in his sixties, is cooking with spectacular one-handed dexterity. A stunning sixteen-year-old girl with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three leans seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. Her headband, doubling as a mini-skirt, reveals her knock-out figure, leaving little to the imagination. Watching from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed suburban couple, Sandra and Howard Anderson. The girl, Audrey Anderson, turns to Howard with a caustic smile and then returns to the jukebox, while Percy discreetly watches the exchange from behind the counter. Howard turns back to his wife with a rigid smile. Outside, the noontime sun bakes the highway slicing through the barren country as a black Cadillac Escalade blazes a path, heavy beats thundering from within. Kyle Williams, handsome and in his late twenties with a thug style, passes a weathered road sign and his expression suggests this is not good news. He grabs a cell phone from the passenger seat and spots a truck stop diner up ahead. The Escalade pulls off the highway to the old gas pumps. Kyle gets out, surveying the grease stains and rusty car parts littering the ground, and behind the place, the Silverstream trailer is visible where Jeep was earlier. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand-drawn map from the front seat and flattens it on the car roof. A woman lets out a long slow exhale, considers Kyle, then pulls out a cigarette, lights it off the end of hers, and hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag and pulls out his map again. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back as Jeep nods uncertainly, eyes Kyle, then shuffles away out of sight. Bob steps off a chair, turns to Kyle, about to respond when Howard approaches, unaware he's interrupting. Bob's expression darkens at the news, and Jeep walks toward the gas pumps, with Bob right alongside him, not giving up. Jeep stiffens, turns to his father, and Bob gives him a hard stare. Jeep looks at his father, his words hanging heavily in the air. Bob then walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to return to the garage when he notices ominous dark clouds on the southern horizon like a living wall.",

He picks up the photo and holds it over his case length-wise and cross-wise. Wearing a sharp charcoal gray suit, Ryan walks through the airport, dragging the case, with Julie and Jim's smiling faces poking out of the top. Ryan stops and stares; outside, Natalie is embracing a big beefy guy. Ryan slides his swipe card through the slot on the self-service check-in machine, then collects his boarding pass and steps away with his case in tow. He wearily raises his eyebrows as he watches Natalie come in, and she stoops slightly as she drags a large unwieldy suitcase, with a large black bag slung over her shoulder and a coat over. Ryan looks at her and sighs, while she looks blank. At a luggage store, Ryan wheels a wheelie case back and forth, and Natalie kneels on the floor transferring her belongings from her hefty suitcase to the neater, smaller wheelie case. Ryan grabs a travel pillow and bins it, then bins a full-size pillow. At security, Ryan sees a group of businessmen and collects his things on the other side of the X-ray machine, while Natalie is being scanned and takes off a bracelet. On the plane, she and Ryan sit side-by-side with the aisle between them, and Natalie types on her laptop. Ryan looks across at her, she stares at him, then with a dismissive glance, she gets back to work, and Ryan smiles wryly. In St. Louis, as they walk through the terminal building, Ryan gets a call from Alex, and a smile spreads across Ryan's face. Ryan walks through an open-plan office with Natalie, who's clutching a pile of strategy packets, as office workers stare at them heading to a private office. Natalie silently seethes while an older balding man holds up a photo of two young girls. Sitting opposite him, Ryan glances down, with Natalie beside him, incredulous. Bob sits back resigned, shaking his head, as Natalie studies Ryan, and craggy-faced Bob stares at Ryan thoughtfully and glances down at the photos of his girls. Ryan nods to Natalie, who picks up one of the strategy packets and hands it to Bob, who looks at the packet and takes it. At the Hilton, Natalie follows Ryan into the lobby, as a woman stares at him while he walks past the queue and up to the desk, handing her a leaflet, which she snatches. In the dining room, Ryan sits with three plates of food, and Natalie sits, poking at her plate of food with her fork. Ryan throws out his hand and smiles.",
    "457": "Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight, while the Brutes witness as the Giant bursts into flames. In the chapel, the Impressive Clergyman continues speaking as Fezzik removes the holocaust cloak and rushes forward to grab the quickly closing portcullis, swinging it upward with great effort. Yellin watches in fear. Buttercup smiles and shakes her head, knowing she is correct, while Yellin is pressed against the main gate as Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik close in. Westley whips a sword out and hands it to Fezzik. Buttercup stands there, dazed. Count Rugen and his four warriors race through the castle, stopping incredulously at a complex intersection of corridors, while Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik approach. Fezzik drags Westley, who is dragging Yellin's sword due to his weakness. As the confrontation starts, Rugen’s warriors attack, and Inigo goes wild, swiftly defeating them all before they even have a chance to fight back. Holding his sword, Rugen stands for a moment, then unexpectedly turns and runs away, with Inigo surprised but then pursuing him. Rugen runs through a half-open heavy wooden door, locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it in frustration. Fezzik, with Westley, who still cannot walk unaided, props Westley up against a large suit of armor and heads toward the intersection where Inigo's voice was heard. Fezzik gestures for Inigo to stop pounding on the heavy door and with one mighty swipe, he breaks it down. Inigo flies through as Fezzik returns to Westley. Meanwhile, the Queen is several paces ahead, and Buttercup gently stops the King to place a kiss on his forehead, surprising and pleasing him. As Inigo runs through the corridors, glancing back, he sees Inigo closely pursuing him like a streak. Fezzik, at the intersection with the large suit of armor, is puzzled by the absence of Westley, while Count Rugen continues to flee, dashing down a staircase and picking up his pace.",
    "324": "Gandalf, Aragorn, and the Hobbits look horrified as Frodo suddenly coughs and takes a huge breath, opening his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest. Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber, and they hurry towards a distant door as Goblins start scuttling down the pillars behind them like cockroaches. Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army rushing toward them when suddenly a deafening roar fills the air, and a fiery light dances down the hallway. The group backs fearfully away from the approaching beast, melting into the darkness, with the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze as a huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall, the ground shakes, and an unearthly sound rumbles. Aragorn hesitates and looks at Gandalf, who glowers at the young Hobbit. Aragorn then leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway, followed by Gandalf, who leans heavily on his staff. The fellowship races down the stairway, with Aragorn picking up Frodo and leaping across a gaping chasm. At a narrow bridge spanning a bottomless pit, Gandalf yells to the others as Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the chasm. They race towards the slender bridge of stone, without kerb or rail, at the far end of the hall. The fellowship recklessly hurries over the dizzying bridge, but Gandalf, the last, pauses in the middle of the span and faces the Balrog with his staff in one hand and sword in the other, as Frodo looks back in horror. The Balrog, a massive creature, rises from a chasm as a great 40-foot man-beast with a mane of flames, holding a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire in one hand and a whip of many thongs in the other. Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall to wall, while Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away, following the Balrog into the bottomless abyss as Frodo cries out, and Boromir scoops him up and carries him away. Frodo slowly turns with a look of numb shock on his devastated face as the fellowship marches on. Aragorn scours ahead of the company as they stumble on in the fading light, with the shimmer of a large forest, Lothlórien, seen in the distance. The fellowship runs across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers, beneath a roof of golden leaves held up by silver pillars, and the trunks of huge, grey trees, as Gimli looks nervously around. The fellowship is suddenly surrounded by armed Elves with deadly arrows aimed at their heads when Haldir, the Elvish captain, steps forward and looks at Gimli with disdain before his eyes lock onto Frodo. Haldir leads the fellowship onto a hilltop where they look with wonderment at the vista spread before them; several miles to the south, a large hill rises out of the woods, upon which rise many mighty mallorn trees taller than any others, and nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a beautiful city.",
    "650": "The male singer kneels and cradles the body of a woman as a thick mist wafts across the stage. An image suddenly appears of five-year-old Latika chasing a train, followed by an image of a very beautiful Latika in her 20s. Back on the game show, Jamal looks lost in thought, and in the director's edit suite, the video plays in the police station. Two ten-year-old brothers walk along a pipeline, and from an aerial view, they head toward the distant skyscrapers of Mumbai. The city sprawls with high-rise apartments and green parks, juxtaposed with vast slums and shanty towns. Jamal walks alone through slum streets strewn with rubbish and debris and approaches a group of men scavenging on a rubbish tip. He wanders the teeming streets of Mumbai by day and night and questions some young boys his age, who shake their heads. Walking through a crowded night market with stalls selling a thousand and one different things, he is later seen in uniform walking through a kitchen, where Salim, also in uniform, dozes on a kitchen worktop and then wakes up. Jamal descends into a subway where a blind Arvind sings and begs. Jamal stops and recognizes Arvind, digs into his pockets, finds a $100 bill, and gives it to him. Arvind feels his way from Jamal's hands up to his face and smiles. Jamal grips Arvind by the shoulders, looks happily surprised with the news, touches Arvind's face gently, and runs off along the subway as a worker starts to fumigate it. Jamal disappears running through the smoke and emerges with Salim through exhaust fumes on Pila Street at night, which is lined with brothels and where prostitutes sit on chairs on the pavement. Salim questions a woman, who shakes her head, prompting them to move on. Jamal asks another woman, who pats his cheek, while a girl in a silk costume and jewelry dances, whirling round and round. Salim and Jamal wind their way down Pila Street as women call down from balconies and open windows to men on the crowded street. Salim and Jamal question two women, who direct them to an entrance down the busy corridor. Inside, the dancing girl continues her steps under a watchful elderly male teacher who claps to maintain her tempo. Jamal and Salim walk through a brothel, pulling aside curtains covering alcoves where couples are having sex. Jamal approaches a girl, who points to a closed door. He peers through a crack in the door and sees the beautiful dancing girl, but Salim yanks Jamal away and peers through the hole himself, his eye widening in surprise.",
    "346": "Gorbag spies Frodo's body and peers curiously at Frodo as he leans down and pokes at Frodo's lifeless body. Sam, hidden in a rock crevice, experiences shock sweeping across his face as the Orcs grunt and lift Frodo, carrying him back towards the watch tower amidst Orc laughter. Frodo is carried up the steep stairs. From the shadows, Pippin watches aghast as Faramir is lain on a funeral pyre. Denethor kisses Faramir's sweating, fevered brow while bundles of dried firewood are being stacked around. Pippin rushes forward, desperately pulling, but Denethor grabs Pippin by the collar and roughly carries him towards the door, throwing Pippin outside and slamming the door shut. Pippin races down the steep streets, passing soldiers running back from the burning city as great balls of fire hurtle through the air. The city is in chaos amidst the fleeing soldiers, and Pippin desperately pushes against the tide of soldiers retreating from the fighting. Gothmog turns to his second lieutenant as Orcs run through the streets, and men, women, and children flee while the pitched battle continues. Suddenly, in the midst of the battle, Gandalf turns as Rohan has come. Gothmog turns at the sound of the distant horns as 6000 horsemen, led by Théoden and Éomer, step up to the skyline with Minas Tirith lying less than a mile away, down a gentle slope. Over 50,000 Orcs swarm around the base of the city, thick black smoke belches from within it as Merry blanches with fear and Éowyn puts a comforting hand on his shoulder. On the battlefield, Gothmog walks among his troops as the Orcs prepare for battle. Théoden gallops in front of his army, issuing urgent orders to his captains and riding to the front of his army. He rises in his stirrups tall and proud, yelling in a clear, loud voice. A ray of sunlight escapes through the black clouds, bathing the Rohirrim in golden light. Weapons and armor gleam as 6000 horsemen hold their spears aloft. Below, on Pelennor Field, the Orc kneel and raise their lances in readiness. Éowyn, her arm around Merry before her, as Merry looks on in shock. As Théoden rides past the ranks of soldiers he runs his lance along their spears, facing his enemy. Merry is swept up in the emotion and whips out his little sword. All the horns of the Rohirrim burst blast upon blast as the 6000 Rohirrim move off, a great wall of horses and spear points building up to a gallop like a rising tide as they charge towards the 50,000 Orcs. Merry, with wind blowing his hair and Éowyn's arm around his chest, yells at the top of his lungs. Gothmog is marshalling his troops.",
    "1165": "She's barefoot. Harry looks up at the reptilian creature. They see a baby Thestral. She takes an apple from her bag. The baby Thestral squawks. She rolls the apple to the baby. Luna throws down a piece of raw meat. Ignoring the apple, the baby Thestral flaps its wings and gobbles up the meat. Ron gobbles a sausage at breakfast. Harry approaches the table. On the stairs, McGonagall is affronted. Filch hammers in a nail and hangs a decree. Umbridge has been appointed Hogwarts' high inquisitor. Pink suede shoes stalk the corridor. Umbridge interrogates Professor Trelawney. Snape swipes Ron. The twins play tricks with a firework. Umbridge destroys it. Filch climbs a ladder. More decrees. Umbridge smiles smugly to herself. Filch swings his ladder. Students duck. He swings it back. They duck again. Trelawney gapes. Umbridge measures the height of tiny Professor Flitwick as he conducts the choir. Trelawney's eyes look round desperately behind her huge glasses. Umbridge ticks a box and leaves the classroom. Students crowd into the cloisters. Professor Trelawney stands in the courtyard, looking devastated. She sits on a trunk. Filch brings out more of her luggage. Umbridge comes out of the main door and approaches purposefully. Professor Trelawney gets up and bumps into a suitcase. She starts to weep. Umbridge is unmoved. Umbridge holds up a decree. McGonagall comforts Trelawney. The great main doors swing open. Dumbledore appears. The students watch with baited breath. Umbridge smiles a knowing smile. Harry pushes his way through the crowd of students, but Dumbledore has gone. In the common room. Harry turns up the radio. In the fire, his image fades away into the embers. A flash of lightning. Lightning illuminates the room. Hermione looks directly at Harry. Rain streams down the diamond-shaped window panes. The rain turns to swirling snow, briefly forming the face of Voldemort. The sun rises over the snow-covered village of Hogsmeade. The three friends trudge towards the decrepit Hogshead Inn. They peer inside. A goat walks through the bar. Hermione addresses around 20 students. He glances at Cho. Students shift uncomfortably. He sits down. She takes a deep breath. Harry nods. Hermione, Harry and Ron sit at a table. Walking back to Hogwarts, Harry consults his friends. Harry grins. Umbridge watches from a high tower as they return to school. Filch leans close as she gives him instructions. Neville hurries away from the bullying Crabbe and Goyle. Walking along the corridor, an odd sound causes him to stop. He turns back, bewildered. An intricate carving appears in the stone wall in front of him, and then a large archway. As Neville watches, the carved stone becomes a pair of huge, wooden double doors. The doors swing open, revealing a long room lined with shadowy mirrors.",
    "1152": "The room is deserted. He starts to read. Turning the page, he finds Rita's article. He crumples up the newspaper and throws it into the fireplace. Sparks fly out of the fire. The image of a face forces itself through the glowing embers. Harry looks nervously over his shoulder as he hears the sounds of a door. A shadow moves on the stairs. Ron appears in his pajamas. Ron turns and goes back up the stairs. Harry looks into the embers again, but the face has gone. The newspaper starts to burn. Harry reads the headline. Then the paper is consumed by the flames. Neville is collecting plants in the lake. Harry opens a book. He waves to Ginny, Ron, and Hermione. Harry gets up. Ron whispers to Hermione. She approaches Harry. Hermione looks exasperated. Ron whispers to her again. Ron scowls at Harry as the trio leave. Late that night in the forest, Harry stares at him. They both stop. Hagrid looks around. He hurries forward. Harry puts on the invisibility cloak and disappears instantly. Harry grimaces. Huge flames burst from four enormous crates standing in a clearing. Madame Maxime gapes and moves nearer. Harry throws off the cloak. A dragon breathes a burst of flame. They bar Harry's way. He pushes past. Harry finds Cedric. He takes Cedric aside. Moody watches, unseen. Harry spots Ron. Ron and Seamus stalk off. He drops down from a tree. Draco goes for his wand. Moody turns Draco into a ferret. The ferret is flung up and down helplessly. He puts it down Crabbe's trousers. Moody winks at Harry as the ferret emerges from Crabbe's trouser leg. McGonagall breaks the spell. Draco reappears. Moody chases him off. Moody pulls a face behind her back. Harry follows him. Moody opens the door to his cluttered room. He hobbles painfully towards a chair and sits down. To Harry's surprise, he unfastens his artificial metal leg and places it on a stand. He leans back in his chair. Harry stares at a cloudy mirror. Moody kicks a stool towards him. Harry looks blank. In a wooden arena on a craggy hillside, Fred and George take bets from their fellow students. The Triwizard competitors pace restlessly in their tent as Dumbledore announces the contest. Harry goes to a gap in the tent. She bursts in and throws her arms around his neck. Rita and her photographer. Rita looks Krum up and down. She strokes his cheek with her quill. Fleur puts her hand into the bag and takes out a tiny dragon. She shows it fearfully to the towering Madame Maxime. Krum picks out a dragon. Cedric takes his turn. Harry puts his hand into the bag.",
    "1234": "He nods towards her ribs, and she hurries to the children and escorts them out to their room, then returns. Connie looks petrified as she slams the door on Ben and locks it. Ben pauses outside, facing the door dejectedly, and after a moment, he leaves the modest clapboard house. Ben cuts off his brother, then in his motel bathroom, he lies fully clothed in a bath that is too short for him, trying to wriggle down, but his head remains well above the level of the bath. Emily is at home working at her kitchen table, with documents stacked on the small table, making notes. She studies her pad thoughtfully, checks a document, then searches through more documents, scribbles a number out on her pad, and encircles another number. Looking down forlornly at the documents, Emily sighs and opens her Filofax, takes out Ben's business card, and studies it. A doctor in a white coat enters a hospital ward, approaches the ice hockey coach and Ben, goes to Ben, shakes his hand, and leaves. George returns Ben's kindly stare with a slight smile. In another hospital room, Ben makes a call on his mobile while Emily is drying up in her kitchen. Ben holds his mobile to his ear, stands looking distraught, then closes his mobile and sits in deep, gloomy thought. A nurse comes to get him, and she goes. Ben stares down gravely, then raises his eyes and stares ahead, his face etched with anguish as he remembers a man and a woman's hand in bright light, their fingers entwined as they caress each other's skin. Lying in bed, the beautiful dark-haired Sarah smiles up at Ben beside her as metal debris spins and scatters in slow motion, a woman is tossed about, and a van flips on a dark road. Ben comes to on his motel bed, lying on his stomach and looking woozy, while a hand comes from behind him and gently strokes his cheek. The figure of a dream-like Sarah gradually lies back down, leaving Ben alone in bed, his mouth hanging open loosely as his eyes blink sleepily. Meanwhile, Emily's neighbor is gardening when Emily walks up to her with Duke on a lead, then walks on slowly past her neighbor's profusion of colorful roses and begins to fight for breath. Emily looks faint as Duke bounds into her garden. Emily blinks and walks towards her steps, but she falls flat on her face on the path, motionless, with her eyes closed. Ezra Turner uses a long, white stick to feel his way down a wide and long flight of stairs, then out on the street, he feels his way along the pavements with the stick held out in front of him.",
    "693": "In the movie, a black-suited Spider-Man looks on pitilessly as Flint crumbles to nothing and washes away. Later, Peter, no longer in the Spider-Man suit, walks through a dilapidated breeze block building and pauses to look at himself in a chipped mirror. He adjusts his floppy forelock and stares at his reflection with a frown and fierce eyes. Outside, his landlord is mopping the floor, and Peter glances at the landlord's daughter watching from a doorway. She joins her father, and inside his flat, Peter closes the French windows to the balcony and paces restlessly before examining his reflection again. He unbuttons his shirt to reveal the top of the black spider suit with its gray web and spider emblem and looks at it with uncertainty and fear before tossing it back into the trunk and backing away wearily. Later, he visits Aunt May, who looks into his eyes, making Peter blink uncertainly as his expression wavers, and he glances at her kindly face. Meanwhile, Mary Jane leaves a jazz restaurant with its blue and red neon sign still off, and with a glum expression, she wraps her coat collar around her neck and walks away down the street, looking wretched and alone in the crowded pavement before sitting on a bench and hesitating over calling Peter Parker or Harry Osborne on her mobile. Harry is seen painting a still life expertly as Peter picks up a payphone near his room, drops a coin, sighs, and hangs up. His landlord emerges peeling an orange, and when Peter looks at him searchingly, the landlord's eyes widen before he and his daughter retreat into their flat, with the daughter peeping out to wave. At the top of the Osborne luxury apartment building, Mary Jane exits the lift into the penthouse where Harry waits for her. She takes a deep unhappy breath, and as Harry busily cooks, he turns up the music and grins at Mary Jane, who grins back and starts dancing the twist. Harry smiles, and she encourages him to join in, pulling him from the stove. He joins her, crouching lower as the pan behind him starts to smoke.",
    "1134": "Lupin sinks onto a chair, his head lowered, while George looks solemn and giant Hagrid, his head wedged behind a roof beam, gazes blankly. Harry turns away, his face sad and pale. Later, Ron is asleep in bed, and across the room, Harry is also asleep but dreaming of Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Cameras flash as he sees the locket, the diary, a staring eye, and a ring on Dumbledore's finger. Dreaming of Voldemort and the old wand maker, Harry stirs and wakes, lying ashen-faced on his back as he stares up at the ceiling. Harry snatches up his wand, and with his rucksack on his back, he secretly leaves the Weasley's house and starts to stride away. Ron comes out of the house, follows Harry, and Harry stops and turns round to stare at Ron, who looks back at the house. Ron steps closer to Harry, and the two friends' eyes are fixed on each other. Harry takes off his rucksack and drops it on the ground, turns away, and Ron picks it up and slings it over his shoulder. They head back towards the house. He reads a headline, and in a moving picture, Dumbledore closes the massive doors of Hogwarts School. The back of her beaded dress is unfastened, and he walks over and stands behind her, hesitating for a moment. She half-turns to him, he zips up her dress, and Ginny turns towards him, and they kiss. George tiptoes in cleaning his teeth with a bandage over his ear. He sticks his toothbrush in his ear, picks up a cup, and drinks. Ginny spots him and breaks away from Harry, and George smiles and winks. Harry gently strokes Ginny's arm as she slips away. Looking slightly embarrassed, Harry grins, and George gives him a knowing look. Mr. Weasley organizes the erection of a marquis outside the house, and the Weasley brothers and Hagrid use their wands to magically raise the huge tent. A tall figure strides towards the house, and Hermione and Harry face Rufus Scrimgeour in the living room, with Ron joining Hermione and Harry on the sofa. The Minister lays a flat pouch on the table, takes a document from his briefcase, and it floats in front of him opening as it does so. He unfastens the pouch and hands the Deluminator to Ron, who unwraps a small cylindrical metal object and presses a switch. The light from two lamps is absorbed by the Deluminator, and when he switches it off and on again, the light flies back to the lamps. Ron grins while the others look blank as he unwraps the Golden Ball, and the Minister holds it out in a cloth. Harry reaches out, tentatively takes the Snitch, and studies the Golden Ball while Scrimgeour and Hermione both look expectant, then disappointed, as Harry turns the Snitch over in his hand.",
    "155": "Bourke-White, who has been moving and crouching to photograph Gandhi, eventually leans back against the wall, finally relaxing. She smiles warmly at Gandhi, who grins and glances at his dhoti, indicating he doesn't wear many clothes. Bourke-White becomes visibly appreciative, having quickly assessed and been impressed by him. Gandhi walks along with Bourke-White beside him, listening while searching for the right moment to capture. She frames Gandhi in the foreground with a soldier visible above and behind him on a wall. Although Gandhi shrugs, he endures the situation. From her perspective, Gandhi continues walking, with the soldier pacing in the background, and she takes the picture. Nearby, a spinning wheel works rapidly as Gandhi, smiling at Bourke-White, uses one wheel while she clumsily tries to imitate him on another. They are in a slightly overgrown garden with latticed fretwork casting sunlight on the grass and shrubs, maintaining a beautiful appearance. As she grins at her struggle and persists, it’s clear she is earnest in her efforts. Gandhi's smile widens, and they both laugh, observed wonderingly from a distance by a guard on the wall. Gandhi then moves beside Bourke-White and demonstrates the process to her, taking and guiding her hands. She watches him as well as the wheel, to which he gives a knowing smile, though not completely patient. Surprised, she looks at him, and he sighs tolerantly, which she accepts without question as she begins another line of inquiry. Ba pauses and smiles again, then shrugs, suggesting the matter was in the past. Looking at them seriously, they all suddenly burst into laughter like schoolgirls. Meanwhile, military personnel move quietly but urgently around the main entrance, with two military ambulances parked nearby. A British major descends the steps quickly, meeting a British army doctor coming up, whom he signals to one side for a discreet conversation. The major's expression becomes defeated and depressed by the news he receives. Ba lies on a mat with a pillow under her head, her eyes closed and her breathing labored, while Mirabehn sits next to her, gently rubbing Ba's arm. Gandhi is present a short distance away, staring aimlessly at the floor, with Pyarelal unobtrusively positioned behind him. Azad and Patel enter the doorway; Patel makes the pranam gesture and prays, while Azad bows his head, also clearly praying for her.",
    "243": "Their attention is caught by a boy who has a box of sweets on a string around his neck, and he's selling the sweets, pocketing money. Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over. They search their pockets and handbags, handing over to Father what change they can find, and he, in turn, hands the money to the Sweet Boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his way. Then, Father carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six parts and hands a part to each of the family. They all exchange a look, an acknowledgment of each other, almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, deliberately. The whistle of a locomotive and the sound of trucks rattling over the rails prompt a sound of great agitation from the Jews in the compound. The locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into sight, rolling slowly towards the boundary of the Umschlagplatz and coming to a halt, with a cordon of Jewish policemen and SS guards. Among the great throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train, Szpilman and Halina walking. A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon as the rest of the family reaches the next truck to be filled. A scuffle ensues as Szpilman tries to resist, another Jewish policeman shoves him, and Szpilman stumbles, falling to the ground in front of the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs. He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads and shoulders Mother, Regina, Henryk, and Halina clambering into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered, and when he sees Szpilman, he takes a step towards him but stops, smiling helplessly. Father raises his hand and waves, then turns and goes towards the trucks. Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders, and Heller turns on him. Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified, then he turns and starts to run. Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates, where workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall. Szpilman falls in with them, and they pass through the gates. The doors of the trucks are closed as the train begins to move. Szpilman catches his breath by a building while an SS man and Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile, crawling to the German, and he points to the train as they laugh and walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street, beginning to weep loud, agonized sobs as he staggers on, lost, empty, and aimless, trying to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears. He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty buildings with their doors open and windows smashed.",
    "1357": "Military trucks, tents, and soldiers are stationed while helicopters buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the train crash, haunted by the sight. As Joe stops reloading his gun and stares at the crash, Martin and Preston join them. Joe uses a camera to zoom in and pan from one car to another at the crash site, with Alice watching him intently. The kids, sitting at a table near the window across from the car lot, talk excitedly but quietly as a waitress delivers more food. Cary smiles at Alice, leaving an impact on Joe and the others. The massive train wreck stretches for a mile, with hundreds of military personnel working quickly to clean up the scene. A truck passes by Jack and Nelec, who walk together amid the debris, with Jack looking at Nelec with skepticism. Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who is distracted and picks up reports from his desk on his way out. As Pruitt walks off, Jack watches him go, feeling unsettled. Nearby, fingers tap restlessly on a counter next to a Walkman. The scene shifts to Breen, 23, listening to Blondie in a station store, alone, until Sheriff Pruitt, 60, enters and tosses a candy bar to him. Breen removes his headphones and exits the store. Elsewhere, Charles and Cary plan explosions together, while Alice looks at them knowingly and performs her best zombie impression, amusing Joe. Alice leans toward Joe, pretending to bite his neck, causing him to feel a shiver he's never experienced before. Afterward, she pulls back, smiling. Near the gas pumps, Jack, Edie, and Mr. Blakely appear, moving past small shattered pieces of red and blue plastic. Jack kneels by the Smith and Wesson Model 19, examines the broken plastic, and makes a call on his walkie.

    "701": "A screen shows a scan of a human body next to a high-tech hoverboard. The door of a glass chamber slides open, and green smoke pours out as Harry, wearing just a pair of shorts, steps out, takes a deep breath, and smirks. In a dark, peaceful forest, Peter and Mary Jane lie on a huge hammock-like web on their backs, watching for shooting stars. Mary Jane shuts her eyes tightly, smiles faintly, and then they kiss tenderly. A fiery meteor plummets from the sky and crashes into the forest, but Mary Jane and Peter remain oblivious while wrapped in each other's arms. The glowing orange meteor embedded in the ground cracks open, and black tendrils like living vines spring out and stretch across the ground. Peter, smiling happily, slides down a thread of webbing with Mary Jane, unaware of the tendrils crawling up a nearby ridge like a huge black spider. Peter wraps his moped, and with Mary Jane sitting on the pillion seat, it starts to move off. The strange black substance crawls speedily up behind and attaches itself to the rear number plate as the moped rides off down the woodland track. At night, a train rumbles across a bridge in the heart of Brooklyn, and close by, a burly fair-haired man in an orange jumpsuit runs down a dark street. A police car with a search lamp mounted by the passenger window turns onto the street behind him and drives down the road at a walking pace. The man, Flint Marko, hides in the shadows and watches nervously as the squad car cruises past. Flint grabs the bottom rungs of a metal ladder mounted on a wall, holds himself up, and climbs the ladder to a fire escape outside a bedroom window. He gently opens the window and climbs into the dark bedroom, where he looks down at a little girl of about 10 years old asleep in bed with a tube connected to her nose. Flint sits on the window sill, gazes at her intently, reaches into his jumpsuit, and takes out a handful of letters addressed to Penny Marko, which he gently slides underneath Penny's pillow. He pulls open a drawer, takes out a green-and-black-striped T-shirt, and in the dark kitchen, he breaks some bread in half. He turns sharply as the light comes on and looks at a blond woman in her 40s with her arms folded, wearing a disenchanted expression. They both turn to the door as Penny, who's overheard, comes in. Flint walks over to her, kneels down in front of her, and gently takes her arm.",
    "543": "Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase, and he is examining the broken end carefully. Henry throws the vase against the wall where it shatters. Indy steps to the door and stands, listening. Henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag, and Indy nods. Henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the S.S. Officer. He's so pissed off, he literally rips a machine gun from the hands of one of the startled soldiers. He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three Nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room. Henry looks shocked and horrified. Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead, leading Henry down the hallway as he searches for Elsa. He opens a door and enters. Indy and Henry rush back into the room where Elsa had been left, only to find a Nazi Colonel holding Elsa hostage. He looks at Elsa, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once. Vogel jams the barrel of the Luger painfully into Elsa's neck, and Elsa screams. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, shattering glass. Vogel releases his grip on Elsa and shoves her toward Indy. She is propelled directly into his arms, and he holds her tightly. Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary. She steps back next to Vogel, and Indy is stunned. A large baronial room is decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor. Indy and Henry are ushered in, hands tied behind their backs, accompanied by Vogel and Elsa and two Nazi guards. Elsa crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They only see a hand reach out. Indy looks at Henry with surprise. The man in the chair gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be Walter Donovan. Donovan smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary. Elsa rushes to Donovan's side and takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herself, then glances up at Indy. Brody disembarks from the train along with the other passengers, a cross-section of Arabs and Tuskens. A man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to Brody, who continues through the crowd past various street vendors. A woman holds a chicken out to him, and then the woman walks away, leaving Brody alone in the crowd. Sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward Brody. They meet and hug, then begin to walk. Brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a sinister man approaches, and Brody puts the map back in his pocket.",
    "405": "She turns toward him and undoes her hair, which falls around her shoulders. Fergus runs his hand down her throat, and she draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulling him down as they kiss passionately. She then walks into the bathroom, and Fergus lies there, looking at the picture and listening to the sound of running water. She comes out dressed in a silk kimono, looking extraordinarily beautiful, and he draws her toward him, beginning to kiss her face and neck. She murmurs no as his hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders, then stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper, and the camera travels with it, revealing in a close-up that she is a man. Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her, saying nothing. She gives a strange little laugh and reaches out to touch him, but he smacks her hand away, gets up, and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet, but he kicks her away, runs into the bathroom, and vomits into the tub. She lights a cigarette as Fergus slams the door shut. She sits on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman, with a trace of blood on her mouth. Fergus comes out of the bathroom, and she looks up, some hope in her face, as he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him, but he pulls away, and she falls to the floor. Fergus sits as Col turns to him, and he touches her arm, but she whips her arm away and walks into the crowd, toward the door. Fergus leaves and walks outside Dil's place, where the blinds in her room are down, and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine. Below the scoreboard, we see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working. Fergus is fitting a new window into the finished wall, and on the pitch, we see cricketers distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch, Dil walks with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site, a chorus of whistles breaks out. Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out and sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window, and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. Meanwhile, we see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus, and through this conversation, Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing.",
    "793": "Willie lobs a bottle over his shoulder, smashing it on a Mercedes windscreen. Unconcerned, he ambles after Marcus towards a mall where a manager deals with an irritated Santa. Harrison sees Willie and Marcus. Willie gazes lustfully at someone through his cigarette smoke. Marcus winces and shoves Willie. In an office, Bob sits with a black guy who takes a gargantuan drag on a cigarette while the security chief eyes Bob and peels an orange. Down in front of the grotto, Marcus works a crowd of kids as Santa's chair remains conspicuously empty. Marcus turns to a gum-chewing female helper, rolls his eyes, shakes his head, and then turns to the kids. Marcus goes backstage and finds Santa comatose, waking him roughly. Santa swigs his grog as Marcus goes out front where kids are lined up inside the grotto. A fat kid with an ice cream takes a deep breath and sneezes over Santa. A small girl sits on snotty Santa's knee, followed by a boy with long hair, whom Santa shoos away before looking over at Marcus. A bus pulls up at a bus stop near some cool skater kids, and a fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off, catching the skaterats' attention. Fat Ass tries to look dignified as he walks on, but a skaterat throws a tin that bounces off his hand. Eyes front, Fat Ass waddles towards the mall, and inside, he's in the grotto where Santa impatiently munches nuts. Marcus leads Fat Ass over to surly Santa, and he sits on his knee, staring at him, with boogies dangling from his paunchy nose. He pulls Santa's beard. At the end of the day, Fat Ass is sitting in the car park outside the mall as Willie and Marcus come out, and Willie gives Marcus the finger as he walks away, with Fat Ass watching him go. Still in his Santa suit, Willie sits alone at the counter in a bar, lights a cigarette, chews some gum, and looks resentfully around at the festive social drinkers. He drags on his cigarette and notices a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy giving him the evil eye across the bar, prompting Willie to stare back. The Indian guy keeps his malevolent gaze on Willie before looking away. The barmaid comes over, sniffs his empty glass, refills it, and gives him a sunny smile. Willie knocks back his drink as the barmaid frowns, then smiles, grins, laughs, and pours out a shot for herself as well as Willie’s.",
    "618": "Beneath a cloudy sky, a low-rise bungalow perched on a gentle slope looks out over an uneven lawn. A teenage girl with short brown hair tied back in a small ponytail swigs from a small plastic bottle as she contemplates an armchair standing on the lawn in front of her. In a flashback, she steps out of her knickers and walks slowly across the room toward a skinny boy sitting bare-chested in the same armchair. Wearing just a T-shirt, she straddles the boy's lap, giving a tentative smile as she brings her rosebud lips close to his face, stopping his mouth with a tender kiss. The shaggy blond dog does what he's told. The girl takes a swig of juice and wipes her mouth on the sleeve of her hoodie. She picks up a pregnancy kit, then reaches for the washroom key, which he hands to her. In the washroom, she unzips her jeans, sits down on the lavatory seat, opens the pregnancy detection kit, brings out a narrow paddle-shaped stick, and puts it into position. She pulls out the stick and gives it a cursory look, then hurries back through the store towards the counter where she slaps a pack of sweets onto it and gazes at the test. She shakes it, rolls her eyes at the clerk, and leaves the store, stick in hand, her expression suddenly forlorn. Juno slings a rope of candy onto the branch of a tree and makes a noose, bites into the liquorish rope, and wanders off home. Bedrooms have the light switch doubling as a doll's penis, and naked dolls are clustered on the mantelpiece. There's a photo of Bleeker playing his guitar. Juno dials a number on her hamburger-shaped phone, and a girl lying on her bed with a rabbit on her chest answers. They take up the armchair, shoving it into the back of a car. Bleeker hands Juno a note and she beams. Bleeker wears his brown and yellow sports kit. Juno sits in the armchair on his front lawn. A posse of runners in brown and yellow passes by on a rug. Juno lowers her eyes as Bleeker's eyes cross beneath his yellow sweatband, the color washing from his pale cheeks. Juno blinks happily as Bleeker swallows. A thin smile flashes across her heart-shaped face, and she cuts a pipe between her teeth. She gets on her bike and rides off, leaving Bleeker clutching his sandwich. Juno cycles up to Dancing Elk School, parks her bike, and secures it with a chain lock. She makes her way past the oncoming throng of students, most of them taller than her, reaching her locker.",
    "390": "The Dude is slumped disconsolately back in his easy chair, with two uniformed policemen, one middle-aged and the other a fresh-faced rookie, facing him on the couch. In his lap, a portable phone is chirping, and The Dude waits for the rings to end. The scene shifts to a loft where a huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing industrial lights, dominates one wall. The Dude stands in the middle of the loft, looking into the murky depths of the cavernous space, and turns as he hears running footsteps. Something huge and white hurtles towards his head, causing him to duck and spin as it roars overhead. A naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbles over a canvas on the floor, flicking paint down with a paint bucket and brush. Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts, and sneakers haul the sling back for another push. The furnishings are spare, with The Dude's brilliant rug on the floor. The woman aims a remote at a projection TV, and the screen flickers to life, showing a sallow-faced man in blue coveralls, Dieter, the floater in Lebowski's pool. The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of Kahlua frozen halfway to his glass, sitting in the back holding a White Russian and listening to the chauffeur, a man of about the same age with a ponytail emerging from his livery cap. He takes a sip of his freshly-mixed White Russian, leaving milk on his mustache, and mentions feeling really shitty earlier, having lost a little money and being down in the dumps. The limo rolls to a stop, and The Dude gets out, still holding his drink. Watching the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder, prompting The Dude to turn and scowl as he sees a Volkswagen bug halfway up the block, with a fat man's shape in the driver's seat. The Dude is then grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-nelson by another uniformed chauffeur. As he is frog-marched towards another limo, The Dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath. The waiting limo's back door is flung open, and The Dude is shoved inside, awkwardly taking a seat facing the rear. Brandt sits catty-corner from The Dude, and directly across from him is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.",
    "1228": "Ezra is woken by the ringing, and he presses a button on a digital clock beside his bed before picking up the phone. Tim hangs up. Ezra, now sitting on the side of his bed in shadowy light, lowers the phone slowly from his ear and swallows hard. In the motel, Tim pulls a large bag of ice from the freezer, slits it open, dumps it into the bathtub, and turns on the shower. He checks his watch, which is on the side of the bath, then makes a call. Tim covers his face with his hand and nods as he weeps and rocks back and forth. Meanwhile, Sarah admires her engagement ring. As Tim emails a response to the message he received, the Corvette wanders into the opposite lane, narrowly missing an oncoming car. The Corvette spins and collides with a van full of people, and the van flips several times, throwing its passengers about like rag dolls. The Corvette Tim was driving bounces and rolls down a steep embankment, coming to rest as a mangled heap among bushes. In his motel room, Tim steps gingerly into the bathtub of iced water, wearing the jeans and polo shirt. He slowly lowers himself into the tub and leaves a note on the floor beside it. Tim recalls a blissful-looking Emily lying in bed with him and stroking his face. He surfaces from the memory, reaches for a plastic bucket on the side of the bath, and pours the contents into the water. The box jellyfish glides through the water and up to Tim's hand, where it languidly wraps its tentacles around his forearm and stings him. Tim jolts as his body instantly goes into shock from the poison. As he spasms, he grabs hold of the shower curtain around the bath, his legs kicking. There's a flashback to the accident as Tim hurriedly staggers through undergrowth, tearing up the shower curtain and bringing it and the rail down on himself. Another flashback occurs as Tim lurches toward Sarah, who's been thrown from the car and lies on the dark road. He crouches beside her. Tim's spasms begin to subside. In a flashback, he reaches out to touch Sarah's inert, bloody hand and lies on the road, cuddling her and weeping. In the motel, Tim lies on his back in the tub, his chin sinking to his chest. In a hospital, medics try to resuscitate Tim while Dan is in deep conversation with an official. Emily's pager wakes her. Lying on her stomach, she reaches out for the pager, then raises herself a little to look at it. Suddenly noticing the empty space beside her in the bed, she sits up and scans about. In an operating room, Tim's body is lifted onto a table.",
    "338": "Pippin finishes his bittersweet song and looks up at Denethor, who continues as if he has not sent his son to his death. Pippin turns away, his sorrow etched on his young face. Gandalf sits quietly in a courtyard, alone and defeated. Great siege towers and catapults roll along the repaired bridge that spans both sides of Osgiliath, heading straight towards Minas Tirith. Aragorn, Théoden, Éomer, Merry, Legolas, and Gimli gallop into a vast camp beneath the cover of trees, teeming with men, horses, and tents. Théoden acknowledges Grimbold, a Marshal of Rohan, as he passes by a group of soldiers and smiles grimly as he rides on. Aragorn joins Théoden on a bluff overlooking the encampment. The camera cranes to reveal thousands of men and horses with smoke from many small campfires filling the valley. Aragorn turns to Théoden, who realizes that no matter the numbers, he must commit to war by the morning and nods. The horses whinny loudly in the distance as Théoden looks up at the mountain looming behind them. Horses rear in terror as Rohan soldiers try to quiet them. Legolas and Gimli move through the camp. Legolas looks at a group of Rohan soldiers who sit quiet and hunched, with no one speaking, and then looks toward Éomer, who is unsaddling his horse. Gimli's eyes travel to a row of ancient standing stones marking the entrance to a road leading away from the encampment and into the mountain. Aragorn stands before the road as though transfixed, before him a horse whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously, and a ghostly figure seems to emerge from the gloom. Aragorn starts in fright as he stares down at the little dwarf, then casts another look back at the ancient standing stones before following Gimli. All is quiet in the encampment. Éowyn kneels before Merry, adjusting his helmet. Merry exhales, excited and terrified in equal measure. In his excitement, he draws his sword, and Éowyn steps back, laughing. As Éowyn and Merry leave the tent, Éomer and Gamling sit nearby, finishing a meal. Éowyn ushers Merry off, and Merry hurries away. Éomer watches the young hobbit leave as Gamling stifles a laugh. Éowyn turns on both of them. At the plateau edge, a guard looks down the steep precipice as a horse and rider move along the ridge. The hooded figure slowly rides up the narrow zigzag track leading up to the plateau. Aragorn tosses in his sleep, disturbed by images and voices. As Arwen lies dying, the Evenstar falls from her fingers. At that moment, Aragorn wakes, his sword quickly in his hand as a guard stands in the doorway. Aragorn hurries towards Théoden's tent, and Théoden looks up as Aragorn enters.",
    "159": "Patel reacts with surprise and apprehension as he turns and sees Gandhi standing slowly, and it almost stops him while he is moving toward the door. It stops them all as Gandhi turns and looks at him bleakly. Patel and Azad, along with Pyarelal and now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, are seen there for the first time among Gandhi’s intimate group. A police commissioner approaches Gandhi, demanding his attention. The camera pans to a poor quarter of artisan dwellings in narrow streets, where fires, the sounds of spasmodic gunfire, looting, screams, the roar of police vehicles, and occasional sirens create an atmosphere of chaos. Yet outside one house, a car, army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers, and a group of people form a little island of calm. On the roof of this house, a figure peers down at the rioting streets below. Azad, Tahib, a Muslim whose house it is, Mirabehn, and Pyarelal are also present with Abdul Ghaffar Khan. A surging gang of torch-bearing youths, far outnumbering the police and soldiers, shout up at the roof while wielding black flags, some stained with blood, and knives still wet with blood. Nehru lowers his head under the weight of these burdens, gripping his temples as he thinks solemnly, and nods in acknowledgment. Sounds of rioting and looting echo in the nearby streets as a mass of people gather, many of them youths with black flags, lining up along the building. Azad ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning, where Gandhi lies curled on his side, writing while Pyarelal takes pages from him, both ignoring the chaos around them. Gandhi looks tired, occasionally tightening his jaw in pain as a doctor sits near the foot of the cot and Abdul Ghaffar Khan is beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White, whispering quietly, but stops on seeing Nehru and smiles a relieved greeting, knowing Gandhi’s feelings for him. Bourke-White stares at Nehru and Patel before slowly reaching for her camera.",
    "950": "A Jeep motors along a quiet dark road; Jack is driving, and Louis sits beside him with a troubled expression. Louis looks over at Jack, who keeps his eyes on the road, though deep emotions boil beneath the surface, and Jack gives him the briefest of glances. They stand at the edge of the pit, looking down as something falls about 30 feet before touching the bottom. At the cemetery, Joe and Cary climb down a rope into the tunnel that the alien has built. At the bottom, they light another sparkler and look around the gloomy tunnel, hurrying down the large bore tunnel. Up ahead is faint flickering light, and as Joe and Cary round a corner, they see a massive chamber cut into the subterranean rocks. They cautiously edge closer, finding it full of machinery and some kind of industrial scale construction taking place. As they creep closer, they come across the sheriff hanging upside down from the roof of the tunnel, either dead or unconscious. Joe claps his hand over Cary's mouth to stop him from screaming. They look around at more bodies hanging upside down from the ceiling, none of them moving. The alien appears in the chamber, doing something behind some machinery and holding what appears to be a severed human leg, then scuttles off. Joe spots Alice dangling upside down and hurries back up the tunnel, using a sparkler to light his way, while Cary empties out his bag of pyrotechnics. Joe arrives at a fork in the tunnel and chooses a path. Cary selects some noisy fireworks and watches as the alien works on whatever it is building. Alice is still dangling motionless, and the tunnel fork brings Joe close to her. He watches as the alien continues its work. Cary tries to get his lighter to spark up. The alien remains oblivious to Cary or Joe and stops its work to take Alice down from where she's hanging. Joe watches with mounting alarm as Cary finally sparks his Zippo into life, lights a firecracker, and leaves it beside other fireworks before running back down the tunnel. The alien puts Alice down and investigates the noise. Joe breaks cover, runs to Alice, who lies un-moving on the chamber floor, hesitates, then slaps her hard. She wakes, stares at him, and hugs him tightly.",
    "394": "He puts his arm around her and drags her on. He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET. He holds her hand. Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. She leans against the canvas, looking bored. She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. They settle on a tall dark-haired man in a dark jacket. He nods. He staggers out, buttoning up. He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away. She pulls him over toward the water. Jody follows her as she walks backward, drawing him on. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle. He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly. The gun whacks him across the cheek, and he falls sideways. Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field. Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun. A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front, three in the back. On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat innocent. Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood. Jody is motionless under the black hood. All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it. Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing. Fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner. Jude comes in, with a flashlight. She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her foot. Then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude. He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love.",
    "878": "Kate arrives home and looks around with a frown, making her way to the kitchen where a plate of cigarette ends sits on the table. She picks it up and empties the cigarette butts into the bin. Kate looks at a clock above the stove and then makes her way down the hall to Zoe's bedroom, where Zoe has made herself a den under the bed. Kate nods, then peers under the bed to see that Zoe has several stuffed toys with her. Zoe gives a brief nod and looks away from her aunt, and Kate's smile fades as she looks down sadly. Zoe turns back to Kate and gives a faint smile. Kate kisses her fingers and touches Zoe's forehead before pulling the valance sheet down, hiding Zoe from view. Kate stands up, walks slowly out of the bedroom, and makes to close the door behind her but has a change of heart and leaves it open. The next day, Kate and Zoe walk down the street towards the restaurant. Paula looks up as they enter the restaurant, and Kate leads Zoe towards the kitchen. Inside, a bored Zoe sits on a worktop, swinging her legs, while Kate chats to Leah, and Nick, who has overheard, searches on a shelf behind Zoe and brings out a bowl and bunch of basil. He places the bowl next to Zoe, sniffs the basil, and begins to pick the leaves, then holds the bunch out to Zoe, who smells it. Kate sees Nick talking to Zoe and watches as he gives her a handful of basil, and although the youngster hesitates, she begins to help him pick the leaves. Paula walks in and then goes back into the restaurant. Later, Nick empties a pan of spaghetti and tomato sauce into a large pasta bowl and walks over to where Zoe is sitting, joining her with the spaghetti. Zoe watches him a little shyly as Nick sprinkles some of the basil leaves over his meal, winds the spaghetti around his fork, and begins to eat. Zoe eyes the food hungrily, and when a waiter addresses the kitchen, Nick hands the bowl of spaghetti to Zoe and goes back to work, watching her as she looks down longingly at the pasta. Zoe looks over at Nick, then back down at the spaghetti and gingerly picks up the fork to take a mouthful. Nick continues to watch her as she tucks in hungrily to the spaghetti and grins at him. Walking back into the kitchen, Kate picks up her apron and ties it around her waist, gaping in surprise as she sees Zoe devouring the bowl of spaghetti.",
    "575": "He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, and suddenly flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. It is sharp but brief; he notices it, but since it does not continue, he ignores it. Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain returns. Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the sound; it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify; he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holding on with one hand while clutching his shoulder and arm with the other, as the pain violently seizes the upper part of his body. Parrish grips the edge of the desk, assaulted by pain on one hand, with the Voice coming at him from the outer; each aberration feeds on the other, and he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. Parrish is possessed. Parrish gasps. He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen. Susan at the door now pauses abruptly, her eyes on the Young Man. The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out onto the street. Susan is staring at him now; he smiles, all open and vulnerable. Parrish ignores her, his attention taken by the Voice. His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy, and fearful. Parrish is confounded. Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince. Parrish sits. Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic. The conversation swirls around Parrish, and he is deaf to it. Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself. As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa. Parrish is stunned. Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as Allison continues. Finally, Parrish rises from the table and starts out. Allison is about to press the point but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room. Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slowing as he nears the doorway to the library. The door is open. He hesitates before crossing the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see; tentatively, he enters. A beautiful, classic room with areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, and a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks, which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass. Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight. Parrish is startled; he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before.",
    "673": "Peter watches as Aunt May lays flowers on Uncle Ben's grave and then helps a white-haired elderly woman to her feet as Aunt May's coat billows in the stiff breeze, which also blows falling leaves around the two of them. Clutching her bag to her and, with one hand on her hat, Aunt May strides away while Peter stands with his back to the departing figure. Later, Peter is sitting at the dining table when Aunt May comes through from the kitchen holding a tea pot. She strides up to the table, pours a cup of tea, sits down next to him, and as Peter, in a blue shirt, tie, and spectacles still on, lowers his eyes and then looks at his aunt who sips her tea, he nods his head. She looks at him quizzically, staring intently at her nephew, as tears well up in Peter's eyes. He stretches out his hand to place it on hers, but with her eyes fixed on Peter's face, Aunt May removes her hand from under his. As he gazes at her through tearful eyes and looks away, Aunt May gets to her feet, leans on the table for support, then about turns and runs up the stairs, leaving Peter sitting at the table. Meanwhile, in his lab, Octavius uses two of his limbs to push a curved base into a replica fusion chamber from which four curved pillars rise, easing the final girder securely into position. He steps back standing inside the fusion chamber which floats on the river below, looking up at the structure and the limb, and then suddenly spins around as the houseman enters while Harry drinks. Bernard turns and walks out as lightning flashes, casting Harry's features in a pallid white. Harry strides over to the open French windows which lead out onto a balcony, goes outside with his glass in hand, and stops when he hears a distant thud. He starts to look around the vast terrace-like balcony, where lights on the pillars and small trees and bushes remain dormant. The balcony judders as the thuds seem to move closer, prompting Harry, his face grim and curious, to step forward towards the balustrade. As he looks over the parapet, one of the mechanical limbs rears up and throws him off his feet, causing Harry's glass to fly in the air, only for a pincer to catch it and a limb to grab Harry by the ankle as Octavius smiles. The limb hauls Harry back onto the balcony, aided by another limb, and Harry is set down on the ground, staring at Octavius. Then, the four mighty limbs start to move away with Octavius carried in midair and, as he turns to Harry, scuttles like a spider out of Harry's sight. Lastly, Peter reads it at a newsstand.",
    "524": "Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily and then turns to Holly. Licking her fingers, Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her, and only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, with the camera moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre, and then pops another into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to a child sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa, with some guests chattering quietly, while others drink and eat, listening. As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway and walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe, while Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other, until Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink. The film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing, and the camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands. The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver. Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey, with Holly carrying a casserole behind her. The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the dining room and holding a drink. Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods. Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away and walks over to a nearby china cabinet. As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer in the cabinet, takes out two apples decorated with paper turkey heads and tails, and hands them to April. While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks that keeps the decorations in place. He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards the camera. Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk offscreen, and the camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed, a night table and lamp, revealing Lee.",
    "65": "Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door and stares at Gittes for a long moment before he gently tugs the car door closed. Evelyn remains unperturbed as he drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving her looking after him. Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary, who looks up, recognizes him again, and is not happy to see him; she immediately gets up and goes into the inner office. Gittes turns and strolls around the office, stopping as he spots a photo of the man with the cane, whom he had seen photos of earlier, standing high in the mountains near a pass. Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one, but she refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' while strolling along the wall looking at more photographs, where he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. Still humming, Gittes turns to the Secretary, who gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes goes back to the photographs and hears a scratching sound, apparently coming from just outside the outer door. He moves quickly to it, hesitates, and swiftly opens the door to find workmen scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at him in some surprise. The Secretary returns and sees the workman on the floor as Gittes heads toward the door and nods graciously, heading into Yelburton's office, where there is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude. Gittes nods and smiles, leaving an unsmiling Yelburton, enters, and drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries to tell him something, but Gittes goes on into his office, where she looks up when he enters. Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her, sits, and smokes. Gittes buzzes Sophie, Evelyn nods, she lights another cigarette, and signs it. Cross is visibly surprised and nods. Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking, and he laughs and shrugs. Cross starts to reply, but there is the sound of a mariachi band as some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off, dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. Cross shakes his head, looks to Gittes in some real surprise, and then hatefully. Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans, Gittes approaches one of the clerks at a desk, whose droopy eyes widen a little at a snotty remark. Gittes smiles, regards the clerk's back a moment, then goes to the stacks, where he sees the clerk turn to another and say something, prompting the second clerk to get on the phone.",
    "643": "She looks up to the walkway, sees Jamal, and smiles. Suddenly, Jamal notices Salim and two men sprinting on the platform towards Latika. He points behind her. She sees Salim and runs onto a waiting train. Salim finds her and pulls her off the train by her hair. He grimaces towards Jamal rushing down a flight of stairs. Then, with the other men, they manhandle the three through the crowd to the exit. Salim forces Latika into a waiting car. Jamal is still trying to weave his way through the crowds. Jamal arrives to see one thug holding a blade to Latika's face. Salim points threateningly at Jamal. The thug slices the blade across her face. He jeers at Jamal as he slams on the car window. Jamal looks on helplessly as the car speeds off into the traffic. Behind the scenes, the host walks into the toilets. Jamal sits in the cubicle. The host goes to the urinal. He leaves the toilets. Jamal exits the cubicle and approaches the sink to wash his hands. He looks at himself in the mirror and sighs. He notices at the bottom of the mirror the letter B has been written in the condensation. His jaw drops as he looks through the door. He looks puzzled as he returns to the studio floor. With a sly look, the host sees Jamal being led in by staff. Jamal sits back in his chair and stares at the host. Lights come on and illuminate the host's false smile. Jamal looks up from the screen to see a nasty grin on the host's face. Again, we see that written in the condensation. The host's face hardens suddenly. Jamal shakes his head. Again, Jamal shakes his head. The host tenses his jaw. The host looks disappointed. The host rubs his chin and shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He shakes his head. With eyebrows raised, he regards Jamal. The audience are on their feet. The director and his assistants all smile. The host gets up. He dances. He pats Jamal patronizingly on the back of his head. Then he glares at the director off-stage. The director gives him a happy thumbs up. The host maintains a grim serious expression. A smile appears fleetingly on Jamal's face as the host grins through gritted teeth. Backstage, the host waits for Jamal to leave. Jamal turns to follow the host down the corridor. He slaps him on the back then grips him by the shoulder. Two policemen stand outside the door. They cover Jamal's head in a blanket. The director approaches the host. The policemen bundle Jamal into a waiting vehicle. Srinivas is at the wheel. At the police station, the inspector and Jamal drink milky tea in glasses.",
    "737": "The waiter spoons a dollop of black caviar into Jack's dinner plate, and Rose smiles. Jack grins at Rose while Molly glares at Ruth. The waiter refills Jack's glass, and Jack tosses a box of matches to Cal. Rose raises her glass, and they all toast. Jack raises his glass to Rose, and Cal lifts his glass, frowns, and then sips. Later, a waiter pushes a cart laden with desserts as Jack hands a pen to Molly. Cal lobs the matches back to Jack, who slips them into his pocket and then approaches Rose. Rose smiles as Ruth stares at them. Jack kisses her hand and slips a note to Rose before turning and walking off, glancing back at her over his shoulder. As Ruth stares at her daughter, Rose gazes across the room toward the door. Beneath the skylight, Jack stands on the landing and faces the clock while Rose steps to the bottom of the staircase. Lifting her dress slightly, she ascends the stairs as Jack turns. Another play is a set of pipes where two men swing each other around on the platform as couples dance. Fabrizio dances with a blonde woman, Helga, placing his hand on her back while Jack, now with his tie removed and sleeves rolled up, dances with Cora, a little girl with dark hair. Some people clap their hands in time to the music as Rose sits at a table with blonde Bjorn, and Tommy sets down several glasses of beer, setting a beer in front of Rose. Rose claps her hands as she watches Jack. Nearby, a man falls to the floor, and two other men help him up while another hands the man his drink. Jack spins Cora as Fabrizio and Helga prance back and forth, and he waves Rose over. They stand on the dance floor as Jack pulls Rose close, with Cora standing and watching them. Cora smiles as Jack and Rose dance through the crowd, with Fabrizio and Helga climbing onto the platform to dance. Jack and Rose whirl around, and Jack pulls Rose by the arm to perform a special dance. Watching him, Rose pulls off her shoes, tosses them to a nearby woman, then holds up the hem of her dress. Jack smiles and claps his hands, and when he stops, Rose dances. They link arms and dance in a circle as other couples dance around them. Jack and Rose hold hands, face each other, and spin faster and faster. In the smoking room, a steward lights Cal's cigar while others talk or smoke cigars. Tommy and Bjorn arm wrestle as others cheer. Jack steps up to their table and, reaching over Bjorn, grabs two glasses of beer, handing one glass to Rose and then drinking from his own as Jack watches Rose gulp down most of her beer.",
    "403": "Fergus shrugs, and she looks at Fergus directly, sitting down next to him. Fergus says nothing and shrugs again. The burly man comes up to her and suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink. He drags her through the crowd as the barman eyes him. Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door. Fergus comes out, walks a few yards, and hears voices down an alley. He looks up it and sees Dil pushing Dave away. Dave grabs her, turns her roughly, but she beats his arms away and staggers away from him. They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch. She smiles, and he holds it up to show her. Dave eyes Fergus, who in response grabs Dave's wrists and upends him on the ground. Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck and presses down, looking to Dil, and then presses his foot again. She bends low to Dave, whose voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot, and Dil grabs his arm, drawing him away. They walk out of the alley, and Fergus looks back to see Dave is rising. Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs, noticing a movement lower down the staircase and seeing Dave holding his neck. Dil leans close to Fergus and tilts up her face, and Fergus kisses her tenderly. She goes in and closes the door, while Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave. Dil walks out of the salon smiling and walks toward Fergus, who takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She holds them with theatrical feeling, laughs, leans toward him, and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way as the girls inside the salon pull back a curtain and clap. She takes his arm and walks off with him. Fergus and Dil are looking at their menus when a waiter places drinks on their table and then leaves. They are walking in an alleyway toward her house when suddenly a car drives very fast toward them with headlights on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it. The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches off. She looks down toward where the car has pulled away. A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus, and she touches his cheek. Dil comes in in the darkness, and Fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat as Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room, noticing an exaggerated femininity about everything in it. Fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody, and the camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. His reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside—Dave's. She opens the window door, and they see Dave on the street, in a neck brace.",
    "197": "Potter is now behind his desk. He spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so. He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money. Then, to his goon, indicating the office door. Potter opens the door just a little, and peers through into the bank. He starts thumping his pockets, with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor. Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope. He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern creeps into his eyes. He finally rushes through the door and out into the street. The goon wheels him back to his desk. He is deep in thought, with a crafty expression on his face. Uncle Billy running across the street in the direction of the Building and Loan. George coming from room where he has just left the bank examiner. He sees Violet Bick standing there. He hears a noise, and sees Uncle Billy entering the office. Uncle Billy comes hurrying in. Uncle Billy picks up the phone and speaks distractedly, without knowing what he is saying. He hangs up agitatedly, muttering to himself as he goes into his own office. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace look after him, dumbfounded. George has just finished writing something, and is slipping the paper into an envelope. She looks at him, then says a strange thing. She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, leaving lipstick. George opens the door for her. As George and Violet come through the door, they are being watched by Cousin Tilly, Cousin Eustace and the bank examiner, who is still waiting to go to work on the books. Violet sees the lipstick on George's cheek, and dabs at it with her handkerchief. She exits. As George opens the door he sees Uncle Billy frantically looking for the missing envelope. The office is in a mess, drawers are opened, and papers scattered on the floor and on the desk. George stops short, suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes looking up at him. Uncle Billy gestures nervously for George to come in. He does so and closes the door. Cousin Tilly is at her switchboard, and Cousin Eustace standing beside her. Suddenly the door opens and George comes striding out. He goes directly to the safe and starts searching, but doesn't find the money. Then he goes to the cash drawer in the counter, and looks through it. Carter is still waiting in the doorway to his office. Cousin Eustace runs over to George. Uncle Billy and George are retracing the former's steps through the snow, looking everywhere for the missing money. They pause for a moment on the sidewalk.",
    "554": "Indy carefully walks forward, seeing each letter on the stones, followed by Donovan and Elsa in his footsteps. After a sigh of relief, Indy stands in a small opening leading to a 100-foot drop and a view of a stony cliff wall 100 feet across, with no obvious way to cross. He looks to the Grail Diary for guidance, then notices a lion's head inscribed in the rock above. Indy calls to his son, leaps into space, and hangs in midair. Realizing the ingenious First Crusaders have painted a pathway in forced perspective to blend with the rocks below, Indy throws dirt on the bridge and crosses it like the first Crusader in the painting over Henry's desk. Indy crawls through a small cliff opening and enters a temple with a vast array of chalices in many sizes, shapes, gold, and silver. He notices a man praying at the altar with his back turned, dressed as a Grail Knight, though the knight's face is unseen. The Grail Knight wearily prepares for combat, wielding a two-handed broadsword, but struggles with its weight. Indy dodges the clumsy swings until the exhausted knight collapses. Indy raises the knight's visor, revealing a very ancient man, who reaches for Indy's clothing and offers his sword. At that moment, Donovan and Elsa appear, and Donovan turns to the display of cups while Elsa and Indy exchange looks. Elsa selects a solid gold, emerald-encrusted goblet, which Donovan takes, fills with water, and drinks. Donovan's body then begins to convulse.",
    "729": "Air pressure blows water out of compartments, and the ocean roils around the ship as it sinks deeper. Dozens of passengers still dangle from poles or lie against railings and staircases. Jack keeps one arm wrapped around Rose as they descend toward the water. One man slips off a pole and spins as he bounces off a railing. Some people behind the ship try to swim as the massive propellers sink below the surface. Jack and Rose hold hands as they kneel beside one another. Rose nods as the bubbling water covers the tail rudder and surges up the whole deck. Waves swell around the name Titanic and across the ship. With deep gulps of air, the tail end of the ship sinks beneath the surface. Underwater, Jack and Rose hold hands as they tumble in the jostling current, and the ship sinks and vanishes. Jack grabs onto Rose's life vest but is swept away by the turbulence. Rose kicks to the surface and emerges amid other flailing survivors. For at least a quarter mile, the ocean churns with panicked swimmers. Out of their grasps, one man grabs onto Rose and shoves her underwater as he tries to climb on top of her. Jack punches the hysterical man in the face until he releases Rose. Jack pulls Rose by her life vest, and they swim out of the mass of survivors. Jack leads her to a flat piece of wood floating on the surface. Rose pulls herself onto the elaborately carved panel, and Jack tries to pull himself onto the panel as well, but it tips under their combined weight. Jack holds onto the panel as he floats in the water beside her, looks down, then blinks and nods to himself. Lying on her stomach on the panel, Rose moves toward Jack and leans her forehead against his face. Their breath is visible in the cold air. He takes her hand. Clinging to a nearby piece of debris, a crewman blows into a whistle. Rose's blue lips tremble as she smiles weakly. Sitting in a lifeboat beside Molly, Ruth closes her eyes. Furrowing her brow, Molly looks around at the other people in the boat who avert their gaze. A young woman sobs. Molly glares at the crewman then sits. Beside her, Ruth presses her hands over her own ears. Elsewhere, survivors in four lifeboats work to lash the vessels together. A dark-haired crewman supervising the operation glances back toward the site of the wreck. Still clinging to wreckage, the crewman with the whistle in his mouth floats motionless with his eyes closed. Swimming a few yards away, Jack stares at the man, then turns toward Rose. Rose's lips tremble as she stares at Jack.",
    "49": "She shrinks back, and then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak, he punctuates each phrase with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else, frantically beating out the matches with her eyes on her work. She notices her hand is shaking and reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth, and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes. Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks — but this time it is PETER. REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby, and she goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her, and as REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage, it is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together. The elevator stops, and he reaches across her and opens the door. She stops as she sees something, and instead of a human hand, there is a twin-pronged metal one. SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring, looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike. The hand is starting to come down, but REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out. As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw as PETER comes running up to her and sees the metal hand. Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in. Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall, but he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free. He then rushes to the open window and climbs out. REGGIE waits anxiously, and when she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room. PETER, unsteady on his feet, goes to the window and looks out before turning back and climbing out. Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears and looks down over the railing, but shooting straight down, there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump.",
    "1138": "Harry slips inside Umbridge's office, where the walls are hung with China plates showing pictures of cats, and raises his wand. Umbridge's chair is upholstered in pink, and Harry notices two passive pink shoes placed neatly on the floor. He crosses to the desk, where there's a silver teapot and a China cup and saucer on lace doilies, and searches drawers. He finds files with photos attached, one of Mad-Eye Moody with a red cross through the photo and another of Professor Dumbledore crossed through in red. The Supervisor turns, and Harry emerges from Umbridge's office grim-faced, turns, and walks away, sopping wet. Harry and Ron leave the lift at courtroom level, where a man is hauled away by two guards. Harry tugs Ron's lapel, and they walk towards the courtroom where, from a high bench, Umbridge addresses a woman sitting below while wearing the locket around her neck. Mary sees Ron, and Harry pushes Ron forward into the courtroom, staying back himself, while Yaxley sits watching the proceedings. Ron stands beside Mary, Harry nods, and she holds it up as Dementors hover above. Harry's eyes are fixed on Umbridge as he spots the locket around her neck, and his wand drops into his hand. Umbridge sees it, Hermione trembles, and his face distorts as Ron zaps Yaxley. Hermione grabs the locket from Umbridge and tosses it to Harry, now back to himself, as Yaxley sees them race off. The hovering Dementors chase the group into the lift, but they're stopped by the closing gate as their arms and long-boned fingers reach through the metal grill, attempting to suck the souls out of the four in the lift. Harry raises his wand, forcing the Dementors back with a spell, and the lift zooms upwards. The atrium is busy, with people upon walkways and at ground level, as a lift arrives and the group looks around before stepping out into it. Hermione and Harry are both back to themselves, but Ron still looks like Reginald, and Mary clings to him, taking his face in her hands and kissing him on the lips. During the kiss, Ron shrinks and transforms back to himself, and Mary steps back as the real Reginald appears in his vest and boxers, seeing Ron, who turns. Uniformed guards chase Harry as Yaxley arrives in the lift, and Hermione and Ron race after Harry. Yaxley barges past people, hurling bursts of energy at the trio, narrowly missing them as Harry spins his wand at a pile of posters, causing the reward posters for Harry Undesirable Number One to swirl around the atrium, almost engulfing Yaxley, who brushes them aside. The trio reaches the corridor as Yaxley aims another burst, but the spell disarms Yaxley. Ron grimaces as he runs, glances back, and sees Yaxley gaining on him.",
    "1174": "He puts a huge black egg on the table. The huge egg shudders and twitches and suddenly bursts open. A strange little green-grey creature uncurls from the broken shell. Its long black leg slips on the surface of the table. It staggers and stretches spiky wings. The dragon shoots flame. Hagrid's beard catches fire. He puts it out with his over gloves. A face at the window. Back in school. Beside Professor McGonagall, Malfoy smirks. Malfoy scowls angrily. Carrying a lantern, Filch leads the four children out of the school. Hagrid comes out of his cottage. Hagrid picks up a crossbow. A shaft of moonlight shows the way, following Hagrid and his dog, Fang, along the edge of the forest. Even the huge giant is dwarfed by the tall trees, which rise up and disappear into the darkness above their heads. Hagrid's lamp throws a feeble beam, as he leads them amongst the trees, deeper and deeper into the dark forest. Twisted branches loom out of the darkness, throwing weird and frightening shadows. Hagrid suddenly stops. He bends down, and dips his fingers into a small pool of silvery liquid. The huge giant looks around wearily. They split up. Malfoy raises the lamp, and he and Harry continue along the path, looking around them cautiously. Fang keeps close beside them, then goes on ahead, his nose to the ground. Suddenly, the big dog stops and lifts his head. The boys catch up with him. A hooded figure is crouching over a large white animal lying on the ground. Harry clutches the scar on his forehead. The hooded figure lifts his head. Followed by Fang, Malfoy turns and runs, still carrying the lamp. In the shadowy moonlight, the hooded figure seems to rise up and hover above the dead unicorn. It spreads its arms wide and moves ominously towards Harry. Terrified, he backs away. The figure gets closer and closer. Harry trips over a twisted tree root and falls backwards. He lies helpless on the ground, as the hooded figure advances. Suddenly, something jumps over his head in a flurry of hooves. It attacks the dark figure, who turns and disappears into the mist. Harry scrambles to his feet and looks up at a dark-skinned centaur with a red beard, half man, half horse. Harry nods. As the centaur leaves them, they look sadly at the body of the dead unicorn. The common room. The boys look blank. Harry is not convinced. Crossing the courtyard. Harry sees Hagrid sitting outside his cottage playing a tune. Cloaks flying, they run towards the cottage. They look at each other. The children run back into the school and into Professor McGonagall's classroom.",
    "25": "The enormous length of time that transpires results in a seriously clean Melvin emerging from the bathroom through a cloud of steam. They exit as they enter. The car goes right across the street to a shopping mall. Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly, as the camera reveals that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible. Melvin watches her approach, and they arrive at the table. He holds out her chair for her, having no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in extreme, she gets up, actually ready to leave, but he waves her down. She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. Amazingly, something in Melvin rises to the occasion, and he uncharacteristically looks at her directly. Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit, flattered, momentarily moved, and his for the taking. Carol moves to the chair next to him, sits very close, and he tenses. Their faces are close; she looks at him, her face moving toward him as he is wide-eyed and afraid. She closes her eyes for the kiss, but now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself, but she has already turned away and exits the restaurant. He finishes dialing, extremely tense, a lump in his throat as he tries not to let the anxiety immobilize him. He hangs up. His parents want no part of him, and he needs help as Carol enters with some energy. Simon struggles with his shirt, and she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so. Simon laughs as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath. We are on Simon settling in for sleep when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom. Carol is sitting at the tub's edge, a towel around her, and the towel falls, a better-than-perfect breast exposed. As Simon looks at the bathing beauty, she adjusts her hair. He leaves the bed, takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair, and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol. Simon's pen moves across the blotter. Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision, and then shyly but deliberately, she lowers the towel. Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to the bartender.",
    "949": "The boys pick themselves up and Joe tries to open the back door. In the main body of the bus, a technical sergeant has been knocked out cold. Nelec picks himself up as the alien rocks the bus, and Nelec gets on the radio. Joe attempts to open the holding cell door, but it is locked. Nelec comes to the door as a tentacle reaches in and crushes the driver. Joe pounds on a cracked window above them while Nelec loads an assault rifle. Joe breaks the window with his elbow and climbs out onto the side of the bus. At the front, the giant spider-like alien is busy trying to reach in to get Nelec. Joe helps Martin out of the broken window, followed by Charles and then Carrie. Nelec fires at the alien with the assault rifle as it forces its way into the bus. The boys clamor down from the vehicle and run off the road to cover. The alien closes in on Nelec, apparently undeterred by the automatic fire. Nelec runs out of ammunition, and the alien lunges at him with its needle-sharp teeth. Lying in a ditch, the boys watch as the alien leaps off the bus and disappears into the woods. Meanwhile, Air Force soldiers grab Louis in the evacuation center. Joe retrieves his locket from Overmyer's body and a car pulls up; he clocks the red bus. Joe drives Donnie's car back into town while Donnie has nodded off. A tank opens fire on them, and Joe swerves to avoid the incoming round as more tanks close in. The boys get out of the car and flee. A soldier into his radio as the boys run, hurrying through a back garden and shoving a washing line out of their way. They leap a fence, then race through a gate onto the street, where they see a tank being overturned. Soldiers flee from their own malfunctioning machines, which randomly spray shells, missiles, and bullets around them. The boys flee through a playground from an out-of-control tank. They hurry up a hill and take refuge in a house as the tank smashes up the playground. The boys hurry upstairs in the house, and Joe looks out of a window. A shell strikes the house, and the blast knocks the boys to the ground. They get back up, and Charles is about to strap up Martin's leg, which has been broken in the explosion. Joe and Cary run to the building in the cemetery where Joe saw earth being thrown about. They try all the doors, but they're firmly locked, so they break the doors open and step inside. A tunnel leads into the Earth, and Cary unzips his bag, spilling out a bunch of fireworks. Joe lights one of the sparklers and tosses it into the tunnel.",
    "961": "In a black star-sprinkled sky, a sliver of sunlight crests the Earth as rays of light shoot off the continents, and a golden word orbits into view. Letters rain down into two boxes, spelling out a logo. In a shadowy stone hallway, a lone figure stands under a vaulted ceiling, silhouetted against a wrought iron and plate glass door. Wearing a fine overcoat, he twiddles a wrapped cough drop in his fingers. Constituents wave signs, and later David greets suburbanites. David rides on a Coast Guard boat as it takes a high splash. In the country, David talks with a farmer, then appears with Mayor Bloomberg outside City Hall. In a bar and then before a huge crowd, he chats with Madeleine Albright, Wesley Clark, and Jesse Jackson. Outside Fordham University's Keating Hall, a young man in the crowd claps, his gaze sternly interested, wearing a newsboy cap, V-neck, and tie. David smiles at his many supporters. Indoors, an aide runs to David's campaign chairman, Charlie, who slaps the newspaper shut. Elsewhere, the young man with the newsboy cap studies a slim, hardcover book, folds it shut, and answers his cell phone, working his lips under his trim dusting of a mustache. In a conservative hotel suite, David steps into view, toting a satchel and duffel bag. He later removes a folder from the satchel and flips it open. Its contents lie untouched on a table as David stares out a window at the city, gloomily peers toward the sitting area, then picks up a TV remote and hits a button, watching from the couch. On a downtown rooftop, four gentlemanly figures cross to the guard rail, each in a fedora, overcoat, and necktie; one is the mustached young man. The eldest one speaks, and the older member briefly looks at his mustached peer. In the suite, Charlie joins David, aims the remote at the TV, tosses a tie at David, who eyes its blue and red stripes. Later, Charlie and David hang their heads as a woman hands off a slip of paper, David strides off, and Charlie catches up to him. David leaves the Elegant Function Room, and a newscast shows on a TV. David stands alone in a grand formal hallway, head bowed, holding his hands in his pockets. He later enters a stately Men's Room and studies note cards, with views over time showing him at varying spots on the polished marble floor. He washes his hands, straightens his New York-shaped lapel pin, and looks to the row of closed stall doors. One opens, and a lovely woman in a silk spaghetti-strap dress with a black lace bodice emerges bashfully.",
    "293": "Jeff and Stella turn toward the window, and Jeff grabs the long-focus lens and lifts it up to see Thorwald, who has his wife's new alligator handbag in his hand. Thorwald moves slowly across the bedroom, disappearing out of sight behind the door but reappears shortly to continue packing and puts the handbag into a nearly-filled suitcase. He resumes packing, and Jeff puts down the lens, turning toward the room where the two women watch expectantly. Stella fondly looks at her ring finger, while Jeff reacts with aghast. Lisa moves to pick up the phone book from the stand and hands it to Jeff, who looks for Thorwald's number in the directory while the women smile. He dials Chelsea 2-7099 as the women watch tensely. Lisa glances at Thorwald's apartment, followed by Stella and Jeff. In Thorwald's apartment, he emerges from the bedroom towards the phone, wearing a light summer coat and tie despite the heat. He holds the receiver slightly away from his ear while the buzzing is heard. Packing is complete with one open suitcase remaining. Thorwald hesitantly approaches the phone, uncertain about answering, but eventually picks it up. There's a pause as he searches for an answer, gazes at the receiver, and slowly hangs up before Thorwald can respond. Thorwald stands at the phone contemplating, then decisively heads for the door, ensuring it's locked after leaving. Jeff turns his wheelchair as Lisa and Stella quickly head toward the door, and they pause at Jeff's voice. Jeff calls after them, and the door slams, their footsteps fading down the corridor as Jeff picks up the lens and looks down the alleyway. Thorwald passes the alley opening, prompting Jeff to put down the lens and move swiftly to the wall cabinet, retrieving a box of flash bulbs and a reflector, placing them on his lap and returning to the window. He leans out to see Lisa in the courtyard below, who reaches the stairway and waves at Jeff as Stella joins her carrying a shovel. The two women hurry up the stairs toward the iron ladder to climb the wall between Jeff’s yard and Thorwald’s.",
    "92": "She slides the paper sack toward him, and he looks inside to find the bottom full of fat, crawling earthworms. Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot, and she sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform in the deserted club not yet open for business. With one last bang, we cut to an extreme close-up of an insect lugging a worm, and a pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's house, where Marge and Norm are watching television in bed. After a long beat, with silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs while still looking at the set. Marge gropes in the dark, and he sits in and picks up his phone, while Jerry sits dumbly and angrily snatches it up, then goes back to his food. Gary hands her a flimsy, and Marge takes it with one hand and looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food. Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at Marge with mild interest, stares for a beat as he finishes chewing, then swallows and speaks. Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table, harshly toplit by a hanging fixture, with the remains of coffee and a cinnamon filbert ring present on the table. Marge is at the reception desk while the clerk types into a computer console, and she is on a public phone. The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot, stops by one car, and Carl emerges, quickly scans the lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car and starts unscrewing its license plate. Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket, and the attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket, still puzzled, saying nothing as Carl glances back and starts digging for money, peeling off one dollar bills. Bewildered, he looks about, then asks a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the shop, and the mechanic points while Jerry looks, stares, and swallows. Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle, silently talk, while Shep says nothing and stares at her. Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk when Marge has stuck in the door, then Marge plops into the chair opposite him, and Jerry stares at her, his mouth open. As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on the desk in front of him. Marge enters and looks around the bar, a rather characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people, and it is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising from a booth halfway back.",
    "131": "A man in a prison uniform with a bandage on his head turns and reacts to seeing Gandhi, taking his soup from Khan. Gandhi surveys the crowded yard, observing soiled bandages and determined faces, but is distracted by a group of guards, including an officer and four men, pushing through the prisoners. The prisoners reluctantly move back, their glances revealing Gandhi's identity. The prison officer's eyes meet Gandhi's, and Gandhi, now manacled, is marched down the pavement between two guards with the officer in front. A tall civil servant waits for them, and the officer removes Gandhi's manacles. The civil servant, showing distaste for his task, walks ahead of Gandhi, followed by a guard, toward a grand staircase. Office workers pause to stare at Gandhi as he passes, self-conscious of his prison attire. Tall white doors open, and the civil servant gestures for Gandhi to enter. Gandhi passes two secretaries, as the civil servant moves around him to knock on the inner doors, opening them and motioning Gandhi inside. Inside, Smuts stands behind a grand desk, having been seen previously with Walker. He nods to the civil servant, who bows and closes the door. Smuts crosses to a cabinet, observing Gandhi with surprise at his frigid tone, then smiles. Gandhi offers a wry smile and sits on the chair indicated by Smuts. Smuts assesses Gandhi, unsure of how to handle him, and takes Gandhi's irony at face value, challenging him, expecting a contest. Gandhi considers, then stands, uncertain about his sudden change in status. Smuts signs a document, misreading Gandhi's doubt. Daniels, the civil servant, enters, stares, then confusedly produces a shilling from his pocket and hands it to Gandhi, hinting at the ignominy of Gandhi's entrance. A prison guard appears, looking perplexed at Gandhi before seeking guidance from the office. Meanwhile, a British general descends a gangplank with his ADC.",
    "412": "The series of scenes begins with Ben sinking to the bottom of a pool, observed by people standing around it. Transitioning to a phone booth located in the entrance area of a hotel between the lobby and the driveway, Ben holds the receiver to his ear before hanging up slowly. He stands up, looks around, moves uncomfortably, removes his jacket, carries it folded across his arm, leaves the phone booth, and heads toward the main lobby. As he is about to enter, a group of very old people comes out, filling the doorway, muttering, and helping each other down the steps. Ben holds the door open politely for them and, as they pass, starts to move inside. At that moment, a dozen young people dressed for a high school dance push past him into the lobby. He holds the other door open for them, smiles politely, but they ignore him. He follows them into the lobby, approaching the front desk with them. A boy at the front of the group converses with the clerk, who points across the lobby and gives directions. Terror and disbelief appear in Ben's eyes as he looks helplessly at the clerk. Miss DeWitte takes Ben's hand for a handshake, followed by a twelve-year-old boy's, and then Mr. Singleman's hand, while Mrs. Singleman looks at a seating list. Ben backs out of the seating area, quickly rises as they sit down, attempts a smile, then looks out the window and at the table center. Noticing a passing waiter, Ben raises his hand, then looks apologetically at Mrs. Robinson. The waiter stops, turns, approaches their table, looks at Mrs. Robinson, and moves away, with Ben watching him go and shaking his head. Ben then exits the Veranda Room and walks into the lobby, proceeding to the front desk where he stands.",
    "1353": "Joe and Charles enter, and Charles grabs a roll. Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door, leaving Joe stunned and heartsick. Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack pulls out a pamphlet and places it on the table, showing Joe a pamphlet for Hewitt Sports Camp, with images of happy, smiling, healthy athletic kids. Joe looks back at the pamphlet, his other hand coming up from under the table, and Jack sees that Joe is holding his mother's locket. Jack wants to cry again and throw the locket away but just turns away as Joe stares at the pamphlet. In Joe's room, he holds a paintbrush, working on a Quasimodo model at his desk. The room, recently devoid of a mother's oversight, is messy, with comic books and other plastic models built and painted by Joe, including cars, creatures, and a train. All the boys look on, and their faces brighten. Headlights appear, and the boys stand as a yellow Buick stops beside them, driven by 14-year-old Alice Dainard. She sees Joe, looking away, annoyed, as all the boys silently wait. She considers, shakes her head, and the boys excitedly scramble into the car. The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon through a rural landscape. Cary messes with the radio, Alice looks at him in the rearview, their eyes hold a beat, she takes the Twizzler he offers, and looks back to the road. Joe walks past Alice, who watches him, while Martin sits alone, reading and memorizing lines, and she looks at him as if searching for something. Joe stops stippling, the tension is almost too much, and he indicates the sponge for make-up, which she uses. Joe starts applying make-up to Alice's eyelids, feeling something provocative in being so close to her with her eyes closed. Alice is made up, wearing a coat with a purse, as Martin, in a tie, faces her, both looking over script pages while Charles adjusts the camera. Joe observes, holding the boom mike as Preston wears an overcoat. Suddenly, a pop! Everyone jumps as Cary, laughing, explodes a firecracker. Martin and Alice perform as Detective John Hathaway and Mrs. Rebecca Hathaway, with Preston acting in the background. Finally, we focus tightly on Joe, watching Alice.",
    "138": "Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening in a way that opens the heart, while behind him a mass of villagers waits stoically outside the dwelling for their case to be heard. Meha tries to speak unemotionally, but under Gandhi's sympathetic gaze, his despair breaks through. Near breakdown, Meha gestures around the empty house, unable to continue, and he nods. Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling where almost nothing remains. Two young men, perhaps seventeen and older, a girl about sixteen, and Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, are present. The two women listen together, but Meha's wife looks defeated, with unkempt hair and a dirty sari. Gandhi nods, speaking bleak words that offer no false hope, and glances at Meha's wife, who lowers her head as water comes to her eyes. Ba comforts her, and the woman breaks down into sobs. Later, Gandhi rides in an open howdah on an elephant, lost in sober reflection, with Shukla by his side, too intimidated to interrupt Gandhi's dark mood, which contains more anger than seen before except towards Ba. A ball is hit, revealing a lush, verdant pitch where white-garbed players and English onlookers watch under parasols, with Indian servants discreetly serving drinks. After a four is hit, a batsman notices a car hurrying near the clubhouse with an officer and streaming people, an Indian corporal driving, as a major stands on the back seat. The captain, wearing a clerical collar, determined, looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head. Gandhi is seen in full, in a white loincloth, shawl, and sandals, his attire for life. Charlie studies Gandhi, understands, and grins, prompting a small grin from Gandhi, who laughs, and laughs again. Charlie turns to the guard, who hesitantly unlocks the cell. Charlie enters, sits on a stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling the space between them.",
    "269": "He indicates Ed with a nod of the head, clears his throat, and turns to the door. His tone is harder again as he snaps off the lights and disappears into the hall. Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom, we start to crane down over a beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field, abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of. In the middle background of the extreme long shot, two men are walking across the field. Still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking men, we see that they are Gale and Evelle, both still dyed blue. They are approaching the hole in the ground, Evelle is starting to climb into the hole, and Evelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in. The front door has a holly wreath on it as five three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on. We have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr., inside of which is a shiny red plastic football. Pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle is parked behind it. Glen is leaning out the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him. Glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him, as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit. The trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and slaps his knee. The trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket. It sits on a tee in the middle of a football field, and a cleated foot boots the football out of frame. Looking up, arms out at his sides, waiting to receive the kicked ball, he catches the ball and starts running. He is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers, reaches the end zone, and triumphantly spikes the football. He whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser. Still craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi, the man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground with their backs to the camera. They are in the living room of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden light. As they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the couple is the backs of their heads. They both have white hair, the woman's pulled into a bun, and the old man wears a cardigan, the woman a shawl.",
    "985": "A maid stands in Thomas's way, but he pushes her aside and leans into the cot to uncover the infant. Suddenly horrified, Thomas gags. Meanwhile, a priest sprinkles holy water on the dying mother. Thomas snatches the baby from its cot and runs, hurrying downstairs and bounding out of the house while cradling the baby wrapped in a blanket. He tears through the street, stumbling as he pushes past revelers, one of whom swigs from a bottle of booze, and stops at the edge of a darkened river. Panting, Thomas turns to see a policeman emerging from a nearby warehouse, holding a lantern. Thomas looks left along the river path, then breaks into a run as the policeman blows his whistle and gives chase. Thomas runs into the gloom behind the warehouses and comes out in a dimly lit road, weaving between slow-moving traffic and scurrying into the shadows. The policeman glances left and right, then gathers speed as Thomas darts through a gateway in a concrete wall. Holding the baby close, he hides in the shadows and glances back to see the policeman hurry past. Thomas heaves a sigh of relief and steps forward into a pool of light emanating from a nearby window. Trembling, he turns a corner and approaches the back steps of a clapboard building, stoops down, and puts the baby on the fourth step, then takes money from his jacket and slips it into the baby's blanket. He hides as a young black couple steps out onto the back porch. The bespectacled man watches as the woman dabs herself with a cloth, and she stifles a smile as Thomas leaves. The man, Tizzy, strikes a pose in his fine suit and bowler hat, with the baby lying just feet away on the steps. Queenie opens the blanket to reveal the baby, which has an old and very wrinkled face. She gasps, and Tizzy covers his mouth. Queenie steps closer to inspect it and carries the baby into the house, with Tizzy following. She heads for her room in the basement, closes her door on an old lady wearing a pearl necklace, then peels the blanket from over the baby's face. She opens the top drawer of a dresser, places the baby in it, and half-closes the drawer, then opens her room door to Mrs. Hollister. A doctor stands over an aged resident, while two white-haired old women laugh. Queenie quietly approaches Dr. Rose and whispers in his ear. He inspects the baby and turns to Queenie. They stare down at the naked baby, and she carries the baby into the retirement home lounge, adjusts the blanket, and stares down at him.",
    "969": "He slams down the receiver, then creeps to the hallway door. The other door opens, and the helmeted men grab David. As he struggles, they wrestle him to the floor and flip him on his back, holding him down. The mustached stranger crouches down and presses a cloth to David's face, causing David's view to fade to black. Through groggy eyes, he sees the helmeted men carrying him under a high ceiling with bright lights. Later, he finds himself in a stark warehouse with his wrists bound. The white-haired boss uses a phone and hangs up. They eye David, who sits in a chair, while he consults the book. The balding man meets his gaze, and the white-haired man smiles at David and steps over. David bolts and frees his wrists, but a point of a finger from Richardson telekinetically lifts a floor tile, tripping David. Two men in body suits grab him under his arms and drag him back to his chair, as the mustached stranger observes. David presses his hands to his face and rocks himself. Richardson aims the scold at his underling. As four men exit an SUV, Richardson sits facing David. David's jaw hangs slack as he shifts his eyes. Richardson stands, and a man removes his chair. Richardson stares down at David, who nods. Two men grab David and restrain his arms as Richardson's boyish partner finds the business card in David's wallet. Richardson lights it on fire, and the fire consumes the card while the boyish man returns David's wallet. Richardson drops the blazing card, points a finger at David, and waits. Two men escort David to a door, and Richardson watches as the men lift David off his feet and toss him through, head first. David lands in Charlie's office. As one door closes, Charlie enters from the other, and David stares. David opens the other door but finds only the small conference room. David scrutinizes his friend while Charlie hangs up his phone. With a puzzled look, David steps into the conference room where Charlie fixes a crooked picture on the wall. As David heads out, Charlie gapes at him, then follows. At the foot of some stairs, the receptionist, Susan, smiles, and David shoots an uneasy look at her. Later, in the conference room, sitting at the long table, David blinks his bemused eyes. As a handful of colleagues listen to a woman's analysis, Charlie paces thoughtfully and gives a faint shrug. David's eyes focus on Charlie, who smiles and then shifts his gaze to David, who stares at him with a confused expression. Blinking, David focuses, then shrugs his hands. Now David stares at a secretary on a phone as he and a friend pass her cubicle, and Charlie leads him inside. Leaning on his desk, Charlie folds his arms.",
    "509": "People clap as Holden looks at her, and the Singer on stage speaks into the microphone. The crowd applauds, and Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. Holden pokes her, but Alyssa shakes her head no. The crowd urges her, and Alyssa offers the Singer an embarrassed half-smile before Holden pushes her forward. Alyssa shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd as the crowd thunders. Banky and Hooper stand at the bar while the crowd cheers and Alyssa laughs. She turns to the band, says something, and they nod before she turns back to the crowd. Holden smiles as Alyssa launches into a torchy tune. Banky joins him, and Holden glances at him. Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile as Holden is smiling, being seduced, while Banky rolls his eyes. Beside Holden stands a pretty girl with a short haircut who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there, and the song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild, but Alyssa is preoccupied. She points to someone in the crowd and curls her finger back in a `c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her before she jumps off the stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw-shucks style, at that moment the girl beside him leaps forward. Alyssa and the girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-too-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback as Banky's eyes widen, and he allows a smile to creep across his face as the crowd applauds. Holden's eyes bug as Banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar with a lot of chicks in this place. Holden continues to stare - mouth agape, while Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back. Alyssa and the girl continue to kiss as Banky, Holden, Alyssa, and the girl from the dance floor sit around a table. Alyssa and the girl continue to make out while Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed. Banky stares a little harder, and Holden hits him. Alyssa and the girl break their kiss, and Kim exits. Alyssa looks at him, and Banky is smiling ear-to-ear as Banky and Alyssa laugh. Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it as then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck. Alyssa waves at him as he exits, and Banky slides out of the booth before Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out. Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim. Holden looks preoccupied as the Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, shocked. Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing before John Sloss, the boy's lawyer, joins them.",
    "411": "Across the fence on the other side of the house, a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, are holding drinks and watching, with one of them holding a baby. The Braddocks, the Arnolds, and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style, with the adults in styles infinitely too young for them and the children in styles infinitely too old for them. Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house, while the others are more or less grouped at the other end. Mr. Braddock is hamming it up, and he has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen. He speaks quickly, in a fake sotto voce, towards the window, but he has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience. They laugh as Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold, who grinningly acknowledges the response to his snappy comeback. Mr. Braddock darts back to the window and then moves to the screen door, pushing it open so it slams against the wall inside. At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full-length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, an oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, and the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand, and the people in the backyard applaud. His father stands just outside the screen door as Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. We are now looking through the mask as we move forward down the hall, with everything slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it, and we move out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. We move down the steps and into the shallow end of the pool, with Mr. Braddock moving along the side of the pool and motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool, and they both begin to motion us toward them. We get to the deep end of the pool, where he has a big smile. We surface again and pan around for a last look at the figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask, of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock watching and smiling, the neighbors on each side of the house looking over their fences and laughing and pointing, Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking, and Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.",
    "1087": "Malbin shakes his head and looks behind him at Chaya, who is weeping. Tuvia crouches down, trembling, and Malbin looks to Shimon for an answer. Tuvia, appearing lost, checks the chamber of a revolver brought by someone before handing it back and cocking his own gun. Asael hands Layla over, as Tuvia looks into Lilka's eyes and then springs to his feet, handing Asael connected belts. Tuvia gazes into his fearless brother's face and kisses him gratefully on the cheek. The Bielski Otriad set off through foot-high water, using a rope of belts to stay connected, the water rising to their knees as they proceed. A woman slips but is helped up, while Asael at the back loses his footing but keeps his rifle above water. They trudge through waist-high water like a funeral cortege, with Asael and Tuvia leading. Shimon is supported by Rachel and Malbin as a plane roars overhead. The group trudges on, children on adults' shoulders through a reed bed, as Asael checks on Malbin's map. In a woodland area, Shimon stumbles and falls, attended by nurse Riva. Tuvia pulls Shimon onto his back, leaving books behind, and the group emerges into a stream of sunlight and water, resting on a grassy bank with relief. Shimon is brought on a stretcher, and Aaron alerts Tuvia to Malbin next to Shimon, who is dying. Tuvia crouches by Shimon’s side, and Malbin looks anxiously at Tuvia, who wipes his eyes as Shimon breathes his last. Suddenly, a tank appears on a hill, with cannonballs exploding among the fleeing Bielskis. Tuvia sprints low between them, as Lilka passes ammo to those with guns while German infantry advance.",
    "222": "He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the roadside and murmurs. He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop. One of the cows drops and the rest stampede toward the road. Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing. In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes. The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits. The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the three convicts emerge to follow him. Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through the door of the bank, followed by the three men. He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table. He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on the lips. Delmar nudges Everett. He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of dynamite. He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as customers murmur. George whirls. The customers stare mutely back. The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to steer him toward the door. George responds, barely audible and without brightening. Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded Delmar. George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the campfire's flickering circle of light. Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money. A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if conducting the music. He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby. The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun shimmering off the rough pavement. The three men stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of ice. A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy Bottom Boys.",
    "360": "MINAS TIRITH, with its seven walls of white stone, appears as if carved by giants from the bones of the earth. As the sun climbs over the eastern hills, a shaft of sunlight gleams against the face of the city. The Tower of Ecthelion stands high within the topmost walls. Gandalf, steering Shadowfax, navigates the steep streets of Minas Tirith, observed by the frightened stares of Gondorians as he and Pippin gallop through the winding streets. An aerial shot shows Shadowfax carrying Gandalf and Pippin up towards the seventh level. Minas Tirith is built on seven levels, each behind a circular defensive wall, rising to nearly 1000 feet on its topmost level. A towering bastion of natural rock, shaped like a ship's prow, bisects the city from the second level upward. Shadowfax arrives at a great citadel on the summit of the city, 1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. Gandalf and Pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to Shadowfax, and Gandalf hurries off. Pippin, taking in his surroundings, notices a dead tree in the middle of the court with four solemn citadel guards standing sentry around it. Gandalf leads Pippin across a flat court of white stones, surrounded by green lawns, towards a great hall beneath. Pippin, suitably chastened, nods. Inside a long solemn hall with rows of black marble pillars, silent figures of tall kings carved in cold stone stand between the pillars. Gandalf strides down the hall, with Pippin following obediently. At the far end, upon a dais of many steps, sits a large, empty throne. On the wall behind it is the image of a flowering white tree set in gems. At the foot of the dais, in a small stone chair, sits an old man, Denethor, the Lord Steward, gazing at his lap. Denethor slowly raises his cold eyes and holds up Boromir's broken horn, prompting Pippin to remember Boromir as Uruk-hai arrows thud into his body, causing him to fall to his knees. Pippin starts forward, unable to say anything. Denethor's eyes flicker with pain as Pippin drops to his knee, offering Denethor his sword. Denethor looks at Pippin blankly, overcome with grief, then turns his gaze slowly onto Gandalf. Denethor smiles at Gandalf, as if amused, while Gandalf looks shocked, and Denethor's eyes narrow, leaving Pippin horrified. Gandalf looks at Denethor closely for a moment before turning on his heel to leave, with Pippin following. Gandalf and Pippin stride from the tower hall as Denethor slumps back into his seat. Later, Pippin is carefully laying out a small uniform of the royal guard on a bed.",
    "578": "Everyone sits when Parrish does, but Joe, feeling right at home, spots a tray of refreshments with coffee and pastries and heads for them. There are immediate indications of surprise on the Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer', while Drew's reaction is guarded but intense. Drew indicates to the Board's stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments, and Joe interjects after a moment, causing Drew to regard him. The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, casting meaningful glances at Parrish, as Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members, but Joe doesn't move. Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door, and Joe goes. Meanwhile, Susan is busy giving instructions to a nurse, with a patient on an examining table beside them. As she finishes, she suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception area, and she is startled for a moment, quickly making a last notation, handing a chart to the nurse, and heading down the corridor. Susan regards him, and visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-thirties, Teena, with an arm around her mother, Easter, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in great pain. Easter looks up and sees Joe, abruptly becoming still with eyes wide, as if in sudden recognition, but she just stares at Joe, fearful. Joe looks at Easter curiously, regards her for a long moment, and shakes his head, a firm no. But when he looks and speaks to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret, and Easter's pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile. He takes his hand away, and the orderly wheels Easter off, as Teena goes. Susan regards Joe, puzzled, and Joe shifts, leading to another awkward silence. Susan smiles gently, and after another moment, Joe, more abstracted than usual, stares at Parrish's food and takes another big bite, as silence falls, with Parrish getting lost in his memories. Joe is riveted on Parrish now, and Parrish, aware of him, pauses. A knock comes, the door opens, and Drew enters, looking at Parrish, then at Joe, and stands poised in the doorway. Drew takes a moment, then plunges in, appearing stunned before heading for the door, turning around. Allison and Susan are together by a piano, with Parrish, Quince, and a distracted Joe gathered near the terrace. Quince sees Parrish hesitate, drains his drink excitedly, and heads for Drew as Allison appears. There is an awkward pause before Allison elbows him, leading to silence as everyone waits for Parrish to proceed. He sits, then immediately stands up again, and Coyle heads for the kitchen. Meanwhile, Joe is locked on Susan as if nobody else is in the room, and Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflecting sudden concern with their relationship.",
    "58": "Escobar steps between the two, while Gittes takes a deep breath. The scene widens to include Escobar, Gittes, and two plainclothesmen, who are staring at the empty pipe as if expecting it to speak, as a trickle of water drops into the ocean. A third assistant runs down the side of the cliff over to Escobar. Escobar turns to Gittes and stares at him for a long moment with hatred. Gittes rings the doorbell and, scarcely waiting for an answer, tries the door, but it is locked. He reaches into his pocket, pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side, and starts to manipulate the lock. The maid opens the door abruptly and stares in surprise at Gittes. Gittes, in Mulwray's Buick, whips into the driveway and pushes past. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him, hurries to the door, takes his arm, and stares at him, searching his face. Gittes looks around and sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room. He goes to the phone and dials, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket, unfolding it on a coffee table to reveal the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them, trembling, and gets up as Gittes, charged with anger, shakes her. As his anger explodes, Gittes smiles and hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him; the blow forces tears from her eyes, but she doesn't move or defend herself. Gittes slaps her repeatedly, finally knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase that shatters as she collapses on the sofa, sobbing. Kyo comes running down the stairs, momentarily stares at Gittes, then turns and goes back upstairs. Gittes picks up the glasses and, momentarily lost in them, stares at the lens. From the stairs, Evelyn, with her arm around Katherine, hurries the girl toward the bedroom while talking in Spanish. Evelyn re-emerges, and he nods slowly. Gittes hangs up and goes to the door, opens it, and finds Escobar and his minions appearing from either side of the doorway. A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor, where Escobar's unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside. Escobar shakes his head as Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, and goes up the stairs.",
    "365": "The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook baited with worms, past a tempting lure sparkling in the sun, and past a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried. Will Bloom, age 3, listens wide-eyed as his father, Edward Bloom, in his 40s and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction. A few years later, Will sits with the other Indian Guides as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe, pointing to his wedding band glinting in the firelight. While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored. Edward is chatting up Will's pretty date to the homecoming dance. She is enjoying the story and the force of Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing. Will, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His mother Sandra, from whom he gets his good looks and practicality, stands with him at the door. She looks gorgeous and couldn't be any happier if it were her own wedding. Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves. As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father. Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him. He focuses his words on Sandra. A laugh comes from the crowd. Edward motions for Sandra to join him. As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other. As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin in a special little way. The crowd applauds. Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for her absent husband, with a smile as warm as summer. We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. Both men are a little drunk. A long beat, then. Will won't let him get the last word. Angle on Edward, who waves a hand, signaling enough of you, before he walks away. Angle on Will, still fuming with righteous anger. On a typically busy day, Will is on hold with the phone cradled under an ear, sorting through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk. Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope and rips it open. At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich. Edward takes a seat and starts to eat his sandwich as Sandra stands by the window, watching. Edward swims laps in the family pool, born to the water. Edward stares intently into the water, like a lion in wait. We look down at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something changes, and sure enough, as we look up again, it's a younger Edward Bloom, in his 20s, staring into the water.",
    "198": "They continue down the street on their search, while Potter peers through the slats of his Venetian blind, watching them. George and Uncle Billy continue their search in a shabby, old-fashioned, gas-lit room that has been turned almost inside out and upside down in an effort to locate the missing money. George grabs Uncle Billy by the lapels, jerking him to his feet and shaking him as Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, with all his pockets hanging out, empty. George throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, still shouting at him in a manner that is almost maniacal. George then turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes, while Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms. George enters the hall where Mary turns and sees him with a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders, and then he sneezes violently. Mary stares at him, aware that something unusual has happened, as George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap. Mary, who is helping Pete decorate the Christmas tree, realizes that something is seriously wrong and breaks off as Janie thumps away at the piano. Mary leads George, with Tommy hanging onto his coat-tails and pulling at him, toward the kitchen, and as they go, the camera pans with them. After they come through the door, Tommy leaves, and George paces about the kitchen, worried, before going toward the doorway. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete. The knob on the banister comes off in George's hand, and he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room but instead replaces it before proceeding up the stairs, hearing the monotonous rhythm of Janie at the piano. He tiptoes in to see Zuzu, aged six, sitting up in her bed with the lamp burning beside her, holding her prize flower. Seeing she’s awake, he comes over and sits on the edge of her bed. She starts to get out of bed but shakes her head, pressing the flower to herself as a few petals fall off, which she picks up before handing the fallen petals and the flower to George.",
    "297": "She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune and still wears her hearing aid as she settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over, noticing him kneeling down, inspecting his flowers, and touching them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He notices her but doesn't speak, and she begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her, showing with the strong movements of his mouth that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. Started and a little shocked, she moves away from the fence. Jeff is seated in the foreground in a waist shot when the entrance door to his apartment opens behind him. Stella McGaffery comes in, pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark-haired woman dressed like a district nurse, with a dark coat, dark felt hat, and a white uniform showing underneath the coat. As she comes down the landing stairs, holding the wrought iron railing with one hand, she carries a small black bag, which she puts down on a table, then takes off her hat and coat and hangs them on a chair. Her attire is worn and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff, whose face shows he doesn't think much of it, and swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her. She takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down, looks at it, and talks as she works. As she leaves him holding the thermometer, the camera pulls back as she crosses to a divan, takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it, talking all the time. He takes out the thermometer, having no answer, and, defeated, puts it back into his mouth as Stella goes on with her work. The camera pans her over to him as she takes out the thermometer, looks at it, and then gets down the thermometer. She helps him stand on one foot, then helps him off with his pajama top. He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil, and the camera is very low at one end of the divan where Jeff's head, half-buried in the sheet, is large in the foreground, while beyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking.",
    "1132": "Harry sits in his room, holding a shard of broken mirror and stares pensively at his own reflection, then sees an eye that is not his own looking back at him. Hedwig is sitting patiently in her cage. Harry packs a rucksack, taking a notebook with the letters RAB written in it, a gold locket on a chain, and a newspaper with Dumbledore's obituary by Elphias Doge. Harry comes down the stairs, holding his rucksack and Hedwig's cage, to a bare living room. He opens the door of the cupboard under the stairs and peers inside, pulls a cord, and the light in the cupboard comes on. Harry steps inside what was once his bedroom and slowly shakes his head, spots a toy soldier wielding a sword, picks up the metal soldier, studies it solemnly, and puts it back. He opens the front door to see Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione; Mad-eye Moody, Mr. Weasley, and Kingsley Shacklebolt follow them inside. Hermione has plucked a hair from Harry's head and puts it in the flask Moody's holding. Fleur Delacour with Bill, the Weasley twins, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks stand nearby as Moody glares at Fred. He sips, grimaces, passes the flask to George, and starts to shrink. George also pulls a face and shrinks. Mundungus drinks and grows a little. The flask is passed to Fleur, then Ron, and finally, Hermione, and they all change physically until each one looks like Harry. Moody retrieves the flask from Hermione, then joins the real Harry and they both survey the six Harry Potter lookalikes. He empties clothes onto the floor, and the real Harry steps out of the front door with Hedwig on his arm, the snowy owl spreading her wings and flying away into the night sky. Harry is in Hagrid's motorbike sidecar as some ride broomsticks and Bill Weasley rides a thestral, a winged, skeletal horse. Decoy Harrys on broomsticks sweep past Moody as Hagrid rides his motorbike up into the air, forcing Moody to duck. Two thestrals zoom over his head, and, in the sidecar, Harry grips the windscreen as Moody passes on a souped-up broomstick. Lightning flashes through the clouds as Harry clings to the windscreen when death eaters appear and zoom over the decoy Harrys. They race through the glowering clouds, and the decoys draw some death eaters away. Hagrid presses a button, and a burst of flame shoots out of the rear, propelling the bike forward as they land on the motorway with death eaters in pursuit. Harry aims his wand as a death eater crashes to the ground, a caravan veers out of control and tips over, and Hagrid swerves into oncoming traffic to avoid it, heading into a tunnel on the wrong carriageway.",
    "157": "An Indian regimental band strikes up martial music as a detachment of Indian Royal Air Force comes to attention at the shouted command of their NCO. An elaborately dressed military aide opens the door, and Lord Louis Mountbatten, resplendent in naval uniform, steps out onto the platform. He pauses and renders a salute. Nehru, Lady Mountbatten, and dignitaries look on as English and Indians watch Mountbatten approach a group of microphones identified as NBC, CBS, BBC, etc. He grins in his youthful, beguiling manner and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd, but it is cut off by the sound of a door being opened, close. Jinnah stands by one of the great pillars of the immense portico. It is a break in their Independence Conference, and as he lights a cigarette, a weary Gandhi approaches him with Azad. Jinnah's anger is clearly too deep to be left at the conference table. He slaps his lighter shut and addresses Gandhi in hushed but fiercely felt words. Nehru and Patel are approaching from the conference room, both of them looking worn and angry too. Jinnah raises his voice deliberately so Nehru will hear and sneers at the idea, though he cools a little. Gandhi is staring at Jinnah, trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear. He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion. Gandhi nods, and reluctantly the adversaries move back to the conference room with Gandhi the last through the door. Meanwhile, featuring Godse waving a black flag and shouting, a gathering of Hindu youths is near the entrance to the ashram. The youths and Kallenbach look back toward the ashram as Nehru steps out onto the porch and glares at the youths, his presence silencing them. Gandhi is rising from the floor, where his spinning wheel sits, and he stops halfway up, listening, then exhales a weary sigh. Mirabehn is spinning across the room and lifts her head as a signal to someone out of shot. Gandhi's two grandnieces, Manu and Abha, who help Mirabehn now that Ba is gone, rise quickly at Mirabehn's signal, with Manu helping with his shawl and Abha holding his sandals so that he can slip into them. It's cross—he's worried about other things, but Mirabehn just smiles at it. Gandhi looks down at Abha and taps her sharply on the top of the head. She nods obediently, a flicker of a smile around her mouth, youthful and irrepressible. The beauty of it almost saddens Gandhi. He taps her again—gently—and goes out.",
    "940": "In his mind, he sees the action about to unfold. The men eye their leader, who makes a cutthroat gesture to them. In his mind, Holmes sees a thug with a pocket watch take out a knuckleduster, a knife being thrust at Holmes, another attacker with a knuckleduster, and a third with a club. The gang's leader has a gun. Holmes opens his eyes and lives the action. A blond thug tosses an apple. Holmes thwarts the knife thrust and spins the thug, forcing the blade into another. He throws the man with the club and snatches the gun from the leader's hand. Holmes catches the apple as it falls and tosses it to the hapless leader. Holmes empties the gun and hands it back. He makes to attack the leader, who shrinks back. Holmes jogs off. On foot, Irene Adler enters the auctioneers, Cromwell and Griff. She hands the package to a mature man, who gives her a letter. The doctor starts to open the package. Irene rises. He holds her back. She sits. Holmes stops a sprung switch. Holmes kisses her and teases the letter from her. The doctor removes a banknote from the package, revealing dynamite. His pipe ignites a tapestry. The auction house clears. Irene heads out. She tries to retrieve the letter. Irene goes. Holmes takes the ticking package from the doctor. He runs to the sarcophagus. The bomb exploded in the closed sarcophagus. The doctor has gone. Outside, the scruffy Holmes draws glances from a well-dressed queue of people. A bearded man in a tweed suit watches him closely. Holmes turns, and the man looks away. Holmes, the back of his Oriental jacket covered in dust from the explosion, spots the doctor slumped against a wall. He feels for a pulse, then notices a tiny dart in the man's thigh. He examines the dart, then turns. The bearded man has disappeared. Holmes places the dart in his bag. The elaborately embossed ceiling of a grand restaurant. Irene Adler is led to a table in the center of the restaurant and sits by a curtain, shielding her from a nearby table. She turns to the waiter. From the table behind the curtain, her tea is poured. The bearded man in the tweed suit watches the speaker. The bearded man clinks a teaspoon against a glass, and all the clientele and staff, with the exception of him and the man behind the curtain, rise and leave the dining room. Irene stops sipping her tea and looks anxiously around as the place empties. The man behind the curtain draws it open. Irene closes her eyes, then glances down at her cup. The man has a rattled face and sports a beard.",
    "1308": "David gets startled, puts back the clippings, stuffs the new one inside with them, replaces it back on the top shelf, and leaves the closet. He opens the door to find Audrey standing in the darkened hall. Audrey nods, and David stares at his wife as she starts crying with tears rolling over her affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Audrey nods, walks down the stairs as she wipes her face, and David watches her disappear into the shadows. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture-perfect blue sky, with a line of ticket holders snaking towards two turnstiles where the stadium crew is ripping tickets. David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards, observing the fans clad in Eagles paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he tilts his head sideways. He stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms, noticing the baby wearing an Eagles uniform. The walkie-talkie on David's hip bursts to life, and he pulls it off to listen. David bumps into a guy in line wearing an army jacket, then looks back at him and continues walking. David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles, walks to his post near the gate, and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to him and observes as a security team pats down random males moving through the turnstiles. The green army-jacketed man moves forward in line with a blank face, watching the pat-down ahead of him. David eyes him as he is twenty people from the turnstile, then fifteen, then ten. The man coughs, steps out of line, and Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick crowd, disappearing as it moves away from the stadium. In an unlit arched concrete passageway, sunlight from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself until David enters the tunnel and joins him, handing him a ticket. Elijah stares at David, who exhales slowly while staring back. David's walkie erupts with noise, and the two men stand very still in the tunnel. David turns, starts down the hall, and talks back over his shoulder as Elijah watches the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jog beyond down the darkness of the tunnel. Inside a customized car, the dashboard is covered in thin foam padding, as are the steering wheel and gear shift, with every corner and hard surface safeguarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel in the car parked in the stadium lot.",
    "573": "Jay hears a voice, but it's not the Vendor's; it's coming from a dog. Kay approaches, signaling Jay to keep quiet, and grabs the dog, Frank, who yelps like a dog. Passersby glare at Kay as if he's mistreating the dog, and Jay tries to explain. Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to get an answer, then shakes him again before letting go. Jay, lost in thought, suddenly notices Frank barking at a cat down the sidewalk. In the morgue, Laurel is at her desk when Rosenberg's cat jumps onto it, startling her. She pets the cat and notices something on its collar: a circular icon made of a strange, beautiful metal with a light green, translucent center. As Laurel peers into the jewel, her face shows amazement, as if she's transported to another universe, with a blank look as she imagines sailing through a starfield at light speed. Meanwhile, in the corridor, a bell rings. Tony quickly snaps a fly swatter at a buzzing fly as Edgar winces, flicking the swatter again to kill another fly, making Edgar grit his teeth. Tony looks down at Edgar's hands on the counter as cockroaches stream out from his sleeve. The scene shifts back to the morgue, where Laurel is slammed into a wall by Edgar, who is furious. He grabs Laurel and drags her toward the equipment, and as they approach, Orion the cat bolts from under it, leaping over cabinets and landing on a tall one. Edgar starts to turn when they hear the bell and a voice outside. Jay looks at Laurel, amazed by his apparent influence over her. Though she seems irritated with him, her tone doesn't match her words. Laurel rolls her eyes and looks down, pointing toward her waist.",
    "1009": "Outside, Charles stands with Steven before Charles walks off and Steven leaves in another direction. On Monday, video footage shows a long line of people standing outside Buckingham Palace, laying more flowers at the gates, where bunches of flowers pile up at the railings as a massive group of people is held back by metal barriers. One woman crouches by the gates, holding a hand to her face. Inside a large room, dignitaries and their advisers sit around a long table. Outside 10 Downing Street, a car stops, and Allister emerges from a backseat door, carrying some papers. After seeing the newspapers, Tony moves to leave. Two men, holding rifles, exit Balmoral followed by Charles, William, and Harry. Some Land Rovers are parked in the courtyard, and the Queen watches from a window above as she opens a newspaper. Robin enters holding a tray of items, and the Queen looks out of the window and clinches her jaw as Robin casts his eyes down. The Queen sits down in a nearby armchair, and Robin leaves a notepad on the table close by. Later, Tony sits at a desk with a female assistant beside him. A nervous Charles looks up at Steven, while, at the other end, a befuddled Tony puts down the phone. The Queen walks with two black Labradors, opens the door to an old Land Rover, and gets the dogs inside. Charles settles into the passenger seat, and the Queen and Charles drive along a country road. The Queen gets out, opens the back door, and the three black Labradors jump out. Charles moves round to the driver's side, drives away, leaving the Queen with the dogs. Figures can be glimpsed on the green hills nearby; one of them looks through some binoculars while three more stand still and another three lie on the ground. In the distance, over the next hill, a stag stands alone. Later, the Queen sits on a bed and watches footage from an interview with Diana on TV, with Philip standing in the doorway. The Queen stares thoughtfully at the TV, twists a silver pen in her hands, gazes at Prince Philip for a moment, then turns away. She sips drink from a glass, and a distracted Queen nods faintly. An image of Camilla on horseback appears on TV, and the Queen changes the channel. Various images appear, including Diana in a black evening dress, Diana next to a land mine danger sign, Diana cuddling children, Diana talking with pensioners, and Diana smiling. On Tuesday, Tony and Allister walk along, and Allister indicates a nearby room. The Queen strolls through some woods, carrying a lunch box and accompanied by some corgis, as some chairs, tables, and a barbecue have been set up in a clearing nearby.",
    "1063": "David watches them expressionlessly. Helen looks bored, then smiles ruefully at David. David smiles, then turns to watch the dancers returning. Helen and Danny watch them leave. David and Jenny walk to the car park in their overcoats. David opens the boot and rummages inside. Her eyes wheel up as she looks at him. He tries to take her hand. Back at home, she sits studying. She slams down her book. She opens the bedroom window. Smoking, she looks out to the street lights. Her parents are downstairs in the kitchen. Jenny watches her parents doing the washing up. It's an engagement ring. Miss Stubs looks daggers at her. The headmistress straightens archly. Jenny rolls her tear filled eyes. Jenny turns and walks out. Jenny walks down a corridor carrying her blazer and satchel. She glances into her classroom as she walks out of the school's main doors. She walks down the pavement, then breaks into a run. A gaggle of her friends watch her go. Danny's got a stuffed armadillo. Danny looks worried. David and Jenny leave Danny's place. They head for the car. David opens the door for her. They drive off into the London twilight. Marjorie eyes her husband reproachfully. David shakes Jack's hand. They troop out to the Bristol. They hit for town in the gathering twilight. They stop off at the petrol station. The attendant pumps the fuel. David goes into the shop of the village garage. Jenny reaches into the glove box for the cigarettes. The packet is empty. Jack manages to break a door handle. There's a pile of envelopes in the glove box. Jenny looks through them. David returns from the garage. David notices Jenny looks at the envelopes. Jenny sits expressionlessly as they drive back. Jenny gets out and steps away from the car. Her parents go indoors and David approaches Jenny. He shakes his head. She looks at the envelopes then shoves them back at him. David looks at her pleadingly. They stand apart. Jenny wipes tears from her face. David shakes his head. He opens the boot and takes the bottle from a case. Jenny eyes him frostily. She turns on her heel and walks indoors. David goes to the driver's door and gets in the car. Indoors Jenny stands for lonely in the hallway. David swigs from the bottle then drops it on the passenger seat. He stares mournfully into the distance. His lower lip trembles as he starts to cry. Jenny fidgets in the hall staring at the front door. Hearing the car Jack gets up and goes to the window. Tears run down Jenny's cheeks as headlights sweep past the window. Jenny hangs her head. Danny's playing with a cricket ball as Helen sits with Jenny.",
    "868": "Calls Valjean to Marius as cannons are fired, splintering the barricade and throwing up clouds of smoke. The students keep shooting at the soldiers while wood splinters and flies through the air as more cannon balls hit the barricade. Some of the students are injured as soldiers advance on the barricade and start to climb up it. The students keep shooting, and a soldier is slashed with a sword while a student is bayoneted in the back. Students hammer on the door of a house but it's locked, and a shutter is pulled closed. They manage to get into a building and Marius is shot, falling to the ground with his head and arm bleeding. Valjean goes to him and drags him into the building as Enjolras hacks the wooden stairs away so the soldiers can't follow. The students climb up to the first floor of the building as soldiers burst into the building with guns blazing. Marius is over Valjean's shoulder as Valjean hides behind a door. Soldiers aim their muskets up at the ceiling where Enjolras and the students are huddled in the room above. The shots go up through the floor hitting most of the students, who fall. Valjean sees a low door, yanks it open, climbs down into a sewer, and drags Marius in with him. The soldiers are now upstairs and aim their weapons at Enjolras and a fellow student, the only ones left standing. Enjolras raises the red flag and soldiers open fire. Enjolras falls back through a window, hanging upside down from the ledge still clutching the red flag. Later on the cobble street below, Javert, now in uniform, walks through a puddle of blood on cobbles strewn with the corpses of soldiers. Javert walks into the building where the protesters took refuge and sees the dead students laid neatly side by side on the floor. His eyes stare out lifelessly from his young, pale face as Javert squats down at the end of the line beside the corpse of Gavroche. Moved by the scene, Javert removes from his jacket the star-shaped Legion of Honor medal with its red ribbon and pins it to Gavroche's coat. Javert frowns, his eyes darting about wildly as he gets up, looks around, and goes to a door, turns the handle, and pushes it open. In the sewer, Valjean is heaving the unconscious Marius along, while on ground level, Javert hears Valjean straining and tries to find the source of the noise. He goes to another door, listens, and peers down at a round entrance to the sewers. Valjean slips down a duct tunnel with Marius, and they plummet into the cavernous sewers, landing unconscious in dark sludge. On ground level, Javert frowns.",
    "683": "She moves her left hand to his head and her fingers caress his temple as her hand slides down his cheek. His eyelids flicker and almost close before MJ turns and walks slowly away. Peter lowers his head, swallows, and his head droops. With a smile on her face, she saunters away. Peter enters his apartment building, climbs a dark stairway, and reaches a landing where a door opens behind him and a man playing cards looks out at him. He snatches it and screws up his face as Mister Ditkovich's daughter, Ursula, drops a ladle and sets fire to the stove, and the door is shut in Peter's face. Peter lets himself into his apartment and switches on the light in his single room home. He rolls off the satchel strapped to his back and sits down on the bed, his face glum, with his back to the opened window. On the bedside cabinet are photos of Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and MJ. Beside them is a radio set, which he switches on. The morning sun lights up the skyline of New York as Mister Ditkovich barges past Peter and into the restroom, closes the door, then opens it, prompting Peter to lean forward and shut the door. Harry and Peter enter a lab, and Harry leaves Peter with Doctor Octavius as Peter looks around. They're having tea and the doctor nods. Later, Peter is in a laundromat, reading Longfellow, and lays the volume down on top of a pile of other poetry books before going to the washing machine and opening it. As he stretches in to remove the laundry, he looks across at the only other person in the laundromat, who is paying him no attention. Peter stuffs the Spider-Man costume in his bag, then checks his boxers, noticing the white fabric is stained with blue and red from the costume, along with his once white socks. Peter stands by the window of his apartment, lugs off his T-shirt, drops the shirt on the floor, and opens the curtain door of his wardrobe, revealing a Spider-Man outfit, and a suit, shirt, and tie. In front of the mirror, he fastens the tie and runs down the stairs in his boxers, while his daughter stares as he pulls up his trousers and walks into a room. Cabs pull up outside the theater, where MJ's face is displayed prominently at the entrance. As crowds walk into the foyer and tickets are checked and stubs torn off, MJ is suiting with a fellow actress in makeup. Half grinning, Peter picks up a bunch and hands over some money, and the florist taps him on the shoulder, takes the flowers, and hands him back a single stem with three flowers on it backstage. Finally, Peter glides serenely along a street on his moped.",
    "140": "The cheap glasses, the nut-brown head, the warm, eager eyes. He smiles and joins his hands together to exchange Godse's greeting. Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant — it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi — loud, startling — once, twice, thrice. Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls. Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half-step, step of the requiem march. The huge funeral procession — crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, trees — and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege it reveals more and more. We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy, and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi. And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence. Commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo-Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans. We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kings way. Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands, and behind them a broad mass of Indians. The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier with Gandhi's body: the stout, blunt, but now shattered Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves, and finally Pandit Nehru — a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father. The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with the conductor. He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work. Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so. The European and the conductor push open the door and stride in. Gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner.",
    "774": "Jackson pulls up outside Kate's house in the early morning dew, climbs out of the limo, and opens the back door. Kate comes outside, and they hug. Jackson watches by the limo as Gordon comes outside, smiles, and waves to Lily as she goes inside. Kate turns, and he holds his phone up. Kate goes indoors while Jackson gets back into the limo and changes into a chauffeur's uniform. Tamara looks fondly at her little Pekingese dog, Caesar. Jackson pulls up on the driveway outside Yuri's palatial mansion in Bel Air, where curly-haired twin boys Alec and Oleg wait on the steps. They both check their watches as Jackson takes their luggage over to the boot. Jackson pulls up on the runway at Santa Monica Airport and jumps out as Yuri's pilot Sasha marches over. A case hits Alec's foot, and Oleg glares over a shoulder as he boards the waiting plane. Jackson gets in the limo and switches on the radio. Meanwhile, Gordon watches TV over breakfast when the whole house shakes violently, prompting Gordon, Kate, and the kids to climb under the table. On the TV, the press conference is similarly affected. Jackson pulls up outside and heads indoors as the house rocks unpredictably then collapses. They board the limo as the trees fall off ahead of them. Jackson reverses the limo, and the back door is knocked off. He bumps on a Porsche, and it falls into an earthquake, while Gordon is slightly pissed. Jackson sets off at high speed as the street falls to pieces, and the creeks off the road rear up savagely behind them, with Kate in the back seat holding Lily. The collapsing road rushes out to them, as two old ladies drive steadily ahead. Jackson powers through gardens, and the old lady powers into a rising section of the road. The limo soars over a gap as buildings have obliterated all around them, sewage throws on the windscreen, and a giant donut rolls across the road. The race freeway breaks in half, and a missed truck smashes into a petrol station and explodes. They drive alongside the collapsing bridge as cars fall from the freeway, smashing into the road around the limo. They approach a huge gap, and Jackson spins the limo into a type hole and accelerates over a pass beneath the freeway. Jackson drives the limo into a ramp and drives into the collapsing building's ground floor while a high-rise falls on the road, and the limo smashes out of the other side. In the corridor of the White House, in the airport, the pilot lies dead near the petrol station as Jackson's limo pulls up. Jackson grabs his case from the limo as a giant fissure hole causes havoc and destruction as it arrows towards the airport, and the runway starts to collapse.",
    "127": "Neff, in a blue suit and hat pulled down over his eyes, descends the stairs as some windows are lit. He cautiously approaches, looks around, and slides open the garage door before closing it again. Very faint light seeps in through a side window as he opens the rear door of a sedan, gets in, and closes the door behind him, disappearing into the dark interior. Phyllis drives without turning her head, staring straight ahead with clenched teeth. Sixty yards away, the station is visible with ten or twelve diagonally parked cars and no sign of crowding. Although the train hasn't arrived, there is activity around the station with passengers, their friends, redcaps, baggage men, and news vendors. The Dietrichson sedan drives into view, parks at the line's outer end, with both front doors open. Phyllis exits as crutches appear from the other side, followed by a man, presumably Dietrichson, awkwardly climbing out. As he steadies himself with the crutches, Phyllis retrieves Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat, walks around the car, rolls up the right front window, and then closes and locks the car door. She checks the right rear door and gazes into the car's dim interior before she and the man head to the station platform's end and along it, with Phyllis several steps ahead. Observed by the CAMERA, Phyllis nods, and they proceed amid the sounds of the arriving train and its lights. As the train stops, passengers move towards the tracks, and Phyllis, with the suitcase and overcoat, and Neff slightly behind her, approach the CAMERA. A redcap sees them, takes the suitcase from Phyllis, who hands him the overcoat, and they follow him towards car number nine. Neff lags behind, head down, mimicking a man on crutches. As the pullman conductor checks tickets, the redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into view, prompting the conductor and porter to step forward to assist Neff on his crutches.",
    "779": "Outside, the crowd panics as the amazing edifice of Saint Peter's, with its huge dome, keels forward and crashes into the square. On Air Force One, Scotty studies a screen as the projective tsunami is spread across the oceans of the world. The boat is still upright on the turbulent ocean. Adrian's father Harry plays the piano and drinks. Kearney watches TV with others in the galley as Harry enters. Tony, dazed, gets to his feet and wanders aimlessly towards him. The trolley with the television on it and other filled trolleys start to roll as the ship vibrates. Harry moves towards a door and hangs onto a handle while Tony clings to a table. As the ship lists, the table is torn and personnel slide down the slope. Tony loses his grasp and slithers along the floor away from Harry, who still clings to the hammock. Harry pulls himself onto the deck as the ship lists, facing the black night sky. The ship keels over to the starboard side and completes a hundred and eighty-degree turn as waves wash off. In Washington, a white sheet flutters in the breeze, with a wheel turning and not much movement elsewhere. President Wilson looks up, hearing the noise of water as it swells up the tarmac from Chesapeake Bay, thundering towards the city. A wave brings a large aircraft carrier that buries the White House. On the Antinov, Jackson fiddles with a radio in the loading bay as Kate, in a parka, joins him. She opens the passenger door, settles beside him, and they exchange glances. She gazes out of the windscreen, takes her hand to her cheek while Jackson inclines his head and stares at the radio. On Air Force One, Anheuser walks over to the screen, they turn to Professor West. In the Antinov cockpit, Jackson and Yuri climb down the steps, leaving Gordon with Sasha. In the cargo hold, Jackson hands Yuri life jackets, leans on the steps, and looks at his sleeping family. Jackson wearily removes a life jacket as his son Noah wakes and looks over at him. Surprised, Jackson stares at Noah, lowers his gaze, nods, and they hug. Kate wakes as the Karpovs put on life jackets and the plane descends rapidly. The Curtis children also have their life jackets on.",
    "112": "The platoon walks through a rice paddy, waits deep in water, and then it begins to rain, pouring down on Forrest and Bubba as they sit in a foxhole. On another day, the platoon walks through the jungle with rain pouring down on them, and again, on another day, they shelter themselves while walking through the wind and rain. Forrest holds his hand up to protect his face. On yet another day, Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep through a river, as rain splatters back up, hitting the soldiers. The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in a camp, and Bubba sits down next to Forrest, leaning his back up against Forrest's back. On another night, some soldiers patrol the area, while Forrest lies in a pup tent and writes a letter as the rain pours down, using his flashlight to see. Meanwhile, Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar, hugs a hippie guy, and jumps into the back of a Volkswagen bus with another guy. The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and rain, and Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's platoon is then attacked, a bullet kills the soldier standing next to Forrest, and bombs explode all around as the soldiers scramble to the ground. Forrest crawls over a berm with bullets flying overhead and exploding around him; he rolls over and pulls his pack off as Lt. Dan lies next to him. Two soldiers with a machine gun fire into the jungle, and Lt. Dan shouts into the radio. Forrest begins firing his weapon into the jungle as the machine gunner fires into the treeline, assisted by another soldier with ammunition, but the machine gun jams. A rocket explodes on the machine gunner and the other soldier, killing them, and Forrest looks down, covering his head as rockets explode all around him. The platoon gets up and runs toward the cover of the jungle, with rockets exploding all around the field. Forrest runs into the jungle, followed by soldiers running through it with bullets exploding around them. A soldier is blown up by a rocket as Forrest runs past him, and rockets explode as he runs out toward a clearing. Forrest turns around, runs back into the jungle, and rockets explode while he looks for Bubba. Forrest stops, aims his weapon, looks around scared, sees something move, turns, looks, and rushes over to find Tex lying on the ground, his face distorted with pain. Forrest carries Tex out of the jungle and into the clearing.",
    "50": "He now looks around. Reggie's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other. Peter climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony. As he stretches for the railing, it is several inches short of touching it. As he straightens up and prepares to jump. From the ground, Peter, high above, jumps to the next balcony. As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony, he sees a light coming through the window and looks in. From the ground, as Peter jumps to the next balcony. As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony, there is a light coming from this window, too. Peter looks in. Inside the room are Gideon, Tex, and Scobie in the midst of a heated discussion. Scobie turns and storms out of the door, slamming it. There is a knock at the door. Reggie unlocks the door and opens it. Peter enters and she closes the door again. Peter is silent for a moment. She falls in his arms to be comforted. He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes. The phone rings. Reggie answers it. Scobie holds the receiver in his metal hand. Reggie's back is turned to Peter so he can't see her face. He watches her. She shakes her head. He hangs up. Slowly, Reggie lowers the phone from her ear and hangs it up. She hesitates a moment. As Peter (now called Dyle) leaves Reggie's room and closes the door, he pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of Reggie's door. He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath. Reggie is on the phone. Bartholomew is on the phone. He is silent for a moment, his face troubled. Bartholomew looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway. Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, hung on hooks. As Reggie looks at the hanging beef. Reggie and Bartholomew sit at the table. Bartholomew pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces. She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it.",
    "56": "She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe. Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, taking Gittes' hand. Then he leaps out of bed, rummages around, and tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on, and hurries out of the bedroom, running across the driveway to the garage. There are two cars there: Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard. Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door, and kicks at the right rear taillight of the car with the heel of his shoe, shattering the red lens. He gets up, carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it, tosses the red lens into the shrubbery, and hurries back toward the house. Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, the red and white lights coming in and out of view, with Gittes behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance from Evelyn in front of him. He pulls up before a small bungalow house and she hurries up the walkway to the front door, while he brings the car a few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's, and idles the engine with the lights off. Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway, where the curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house. He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch, and sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rushing through the living room of the small house, where the windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn, finding an inch or so of space at the bottom. Evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment, someone rises into sight, obviously from lying on a bed: Mulwray's girlfriend, just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes into view as Evelyn kneels, and the girl looks up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish. Gittes continues to watch as the servant re-emerges through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it. Evelyn insists that the girl swallow down some pills, which the girl reluctantly does, before emerging from the house, going to her car, and getting in. Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at her. As Gittes starts to get out of the car, Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming, with her intensity actually ripping Gittes' already partially torn jacket. He looks at it and her, which has a momentary calming effect on both of them, before Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face.",
    "562": "She gasps once again, terrified, as Indy lifts her and carries Elsa forward. Kazim and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water. More rat-infested water appears as Elsa, now walking again, follows Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones. Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton, causing a bone to come loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to Elsa's side and helps her into the water. The chamber is flooded with black, briny water as they move toward the altar. Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved coffins like the scholars of antiquity that they are, noting the big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass. One coffin is elevated above the others, and together they begin to push on the lid, straining and groaning until it slides away and bangs against the stone platform, revealing the decomposed remains of a knight in armor. Indy and Elsa look in, and Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield, completing the missing portion of the rubbing. Indy laughs, lights a match, and drops the lighted match into the oil-slick water as Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around and then sees the glow of firelight dancing across the Catacomb walls. Thousands of rats flee from around the corner of the narrow passageway, stampeding toward Elsa and Indy, shrieking and squealing as they approach. The rats wash over them like a rodent tidal wave in their efforts to escape. Elsa screams, and Indy braces his back against the altar, toppling the coffin with his feet. It crashes against the stone platform and splashes into the water. They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. Indy literally dunks her and pushes her underneath as Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, sputtering and spitting. Indy then pops up into the air pocket and looks at Elsa; they are both soaking wet. Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin, looking for an escape route, while the rats begin to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and screams in terror. Indy pops back up through the water, and Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. The perfect picture postcard of St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond comes into view.",
    "1379": "The tent blooms softly with light, briefly illuminating a bedside photograph of James and Lily Potter, then goes dark. The blankets bloom again when, down the hall, a toilet flushes. Instantly, the shadow stiffens, the blankets dim, and the tent flattens just as the bedroom door opens, revealing Uncle Vernon. He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then withdraws. The tent rises, and as the blankets blaze, we cut inside to find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he speaks. A blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of Number Four. The light in the hallway snaps on, Harry's tent droops once more, and seconds later, Harry's door eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. Slowly, he closes the door and eyes the parchment in Harry's hand suspiciously. Just then, Dudley, sitting comatose before the TV, emits a hollow, brain-dead chuckle. Marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his ankle. As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a bottle of brandy. Hearing this, Harry frowns and glances at Uncle Vernon, who glares darkly at him. Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry. POP! The glass in Aunt Marge's hand explodes. Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise. Aunt Marge starts to reply when a button on her dress sails into the air with a zing. Thread snaps. Aunt Marge's eyes widen. Her cheeks billow. Her whole body billows, and she begins to inflate like a monstrous balloon. To his horror, Uncle Vernon himself begins to rise. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes, and he lets go, falls to his knees, and watches Aunt Marge float away. Harry crashes inside, takes his trunk, then puts his heel to a loose floorboard and removes his wand from its hiding place. Turning, he grabs the photograph of his parents. BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! Harry tows the trunk down the stairs and finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty. As Harry storms out with his trunk, we dolly to the street with him. High in the sky, a plump dot rises. Harry walks and walks and walks, then stops, glancing about. An empty playground, swings creaking gently on rusted chains, and a tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. Harry drops the trunk, sits, still as a statue. In the trees above, leaves tremble. Harry turns and studies the swaying swings, the carousel.",
    "652": "Latika appears and gently pushes Salim's gun down as Jamal looks incredulous, with Salim pulling her back into the room, while Jamal remains rooted to the spot. Back in the police station, the inspector and Srinivas stare at the sweating Jamal, and Srinivas grins as Jamal leans over toward the inspector. Two other uniformed policemen rush into the room and eventually subdue a raging Jamal. The inspector wipes the sweat from his hands and face. Jamal carries a tray of tea at the call center, rushing around and delivering tea to the call center workers, who all sit at computers wearing headsets. Dave rushes off to a nearby TV showing the game show and signals to everyone to start dialing the number on their mobile phones. The readout indicates it has found over 26,000 Latikas as the name scrolls across the screen, and Jamal gulps and puts on his headset, while across the room, call center managers walk around, monitoring staff calls. Back on the game show, the host shakes his head, and the director hands him a check. Jamal is ascending in a lift on the construction site of a skyscraper, where hundreds of meters above, Salim waits. Jamal arrives at the open top floor with no walls, offering panoramic views of Mumbai, and sees a guy dressed in an expensive shirt, wearing jewelry and dark glasses. Salim smiles and removes his glasses as Jamal lunges for Salim, and they both fall off the building. Jamal blinks awake from his vision and punches Salim instead. Jamal and Salim sit on the edge of the building with the vast cityscape spread out before them, and Salim is phoned, then shakes his head as he watches his brother go. At night, in Salim's apartment, both are asleep until Salim gets up. Jamal opens his eyes but lies still, then sneaks to the landing to spy on Salim downstairs as he loads a gun and watches him kneel on a mat to pray. Salim touches his forehead to the ground, then leaves his apartment block and heads for his car. As Salim drives off, Jamal appears in a tuk-tuk, following closely behind. Salim's car pulls up to a sprawling palatial house situated on the hillside surrounded by construction sites, drives through the electronic gates, and Jamal's tuk-tuk then arrives outside the gates. Jamal jumps out and watches Salim approach a beautiful woman in dark glasses standing on a balcony. Salim collects a small package from her, then drives past the gates where Jamal is hiding. The young woman notices Jamal lurking at the entrance as a guard closes the gates, and the guard goes to the gatehouse while the woman removes her glasses for a better look at Jamal.",
    "187": "Brackett bends down to the object, then he steps closer to it. He slowly walks toward it and stands back up, looking at Loomis. Both men look down off screen at the animal, and Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away, looking back at the dead animal. They glance at each other and Brackett just looks at Loomis a moment before turning and walking out of the bedroom. Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting, turns, and glances at the window. He stops by the window, stares at the rain gutter in the broken window, and the camera slowly tracks in toward the window. Brackett draws his gun, and the two men step inside. Laurie sits with Tommy Doyle on the couch reading him a story, while Tommy, in his Halloween costume, has a big bag of candy on the floor. Tommy pulls out a stack of comic books from underneath the couch and Laurie glances through the stack. Laurie goes to answer it, picks up the receiver in the den, and Tommy rushes out of the den. Tommy dashes up to the front window and looks out as we see the man pass under a streetlight. Tommy runs to the window in the den and points, and Laurie walks over with the phone and looks. The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallaces' house where Annie stands by the kitchen stove making popcorn. The shape stands close to the camera watching Annie make popcorn as she starts to pour the butter over the popcorn but instead pours it on herself. Annie hangs up, quickly takes off her blouse and blue jeans, and stands in the kitchen with only her panties on. She pulls a box of cornstarch out of the closet and sprinkles it out on the stains of butter. The shape moves closer to the kitchen window and knocks over a potted plant, which crashes noisily against the side of the house. Annie is startled by the crash, looks outside the window, and a hanging plant swings in the wind. The shape leans up close to the kitchen window, looking inside. From the darkness of the backyard, Lester, a large, ferocious-looking German shepherd, springs forward into the camera, snarling and barking viciously. The shape darts away from the kitchen window, the dog snapping right after him.",
    "1051": "He hands it to her, bows, then heads off. Lizzy watches him for a moment, looks down at the letter, then searches for a comfortable place in which to read it. She settles down on a large tree stump. Lizzy folds up the letter and walks off. Mariah follows her inside and up the stairs. But, Lizzie hurries to her room and shuts the door behind her. Inside, she sits down near a window and opens up the letter again. Lizzie cringes as she remembers her family's improper behavior. Then she looks down at the letter once more. Darcy watches from above as Jane heads out dressed in a grey cloak and bonnet. Lizzie is now walking with Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins goes to bid his farewells to Lizzie. He looks over at his wife and gives her a little wave. She and Lizzie exchange a knowing smile. The horse-drawn carriage pulls away from the parsemage, gathering speed along the country road. Lizzie and Mariah are sitting inside. Mariah has a notebook open. Lizzie leans forward in her seat, looking thoughtful. As she stares out of the window, memories of Darcy pass through her mind. Platter of horses' hooves snaps at the rubbery. Finally, the carriage pulls up outside a busy inn. Lydia opens one of the upper windows excitedly. Lizzie waves up at her and Kitty. Lydia indicates that she'll come down and meet them then closes the window. She embraces her sister warmly then sits back on the bed. He leaves the room. Angrily, she throws down her knife, fork, and napkin. Now, Lizzie's out in the garden, carrying a basket full of flowers. She walks around Jane, who's busy sniffing blooms to put in her truck. Lizzie casts frequent concerned glances over at her sister. She comes over and takes Lizzie's hand. Jane sets off back towards the house, carrying her basket of flowers.

Four children emerge first from the cab. Lizzie kisses her aunt and uncle.",
    "5": "The Colonel, deeply troubled, enters silently through the door and starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens a drawer where Ricky keeps his marijuana but doesn't discover its false bottom. The Colonel stands and looks around, noticing the Digicam and a stack of cassettes on a shelf. Meanwhile, Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space. The Colonel takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another, his face tightening as he views the TV screen. He sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized. Later, naked except for his black socks, the Colonel grabs dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window. The camera remains connected to the TV. Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, happily flips burgers on a grill. He suddenly looks up when he hears something, his face darkening, but then he smiles and puts his spatula down. Carolyn drives a Mercedes to the drive-thru window, with Buddy sitting beside her, too involved to notice Lester watching them. Lester leans out of the window, grinning at Carolyn with bags of fast food, while the Counter Girl stands next to him staring blankly. Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin but struggles to appear nonchalant. The sky fills with ominous gray clouds, and wind whips garbage across the parking lot as her Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar. Gripping the wheel tightly, Carolyn stares straight ahead while Buddy looks at her unhappily, then gets out of the car and shuts the door. She starts to cry as Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving her alone in the parking lot. Carolyn closes her eyes tightly, tries to stop the tears, and suddenly screams as loud as she can, the sound still muffled. The Colonel puts down the weights and looks at his reflection in the window, seeing his pumped arms, before reaching under the bench to grab a cigar box. He smiles, opens it, and digs through marijuana paraphernalia, only to find an empty Ziploc bag. Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence, when Ricky pulls his beeper off his belt and checks it, then heads into the hall, leaving the Colonel uneasy. It's raining outside, and Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth. The Colonel sees something outside that catches his eye, craning his neck for a better look. Through a window over the sink, blurred by the rain, Lester is visible in the Burnham's garage, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of bills.",
    "111": "Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away. Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out at a river. Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's shoulder. The shadow of a helicopter is over the rice field below as a soldier mans a gun from inside the helicopter. The soldier looks left as Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter, which circles overhead and lands at the firebase. Bubba and Forrest jump out with their gear and walk, looking around oddly. A soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases, takes two beers out, and walks away, while in the background soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer. Lieutenant Dan Taylor steps out of a tent, shirtless, holding a roll of toilet paper in his hand, and looks at Bubba. Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, not getting the joke, as Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear and follow him. Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys, then steps over to a large black soldier named Sergeant. A distant relative of Lt. Dan, wearing a revolutionary war uniform, falls dead in the snow. Another relative, in a civil war uniform, resembling Lt. Dan, falls dead, and another, in a World War II uniform, falls dead on the beach at Normandy. Lt. Dan steps back to Bubba and Forrest, walks along the walkway with them following, and steps inside the latrine, still holding the toilet paper. He sits down out of sight, stands up looking at the boys, then sits back down out of sight. Bubba and Forrest look at each other. Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon walk across the rice field as Vietnamese rice farmers work nearby. Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road when suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, signaling them to stop. He motions for them to get down, and Forrest complies, looking around. Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down, crouches, looks at the soldiers, and points to his eyes before lying down on the dirt road and crawling. Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know. Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon. Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols in the hole, and then climbs inside.",
    "389": "As the picture fades in, the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint. We are close on the Dude, upside down. As the Dude opens his eyes, we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around. His head is now resting against a hardwood floor, not a rug. The rug is gone. We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway. We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield. The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY. Though he is wearing khaki shorts and a shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter. He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. The car stops in front of him, and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase. The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over. He raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw. The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack. The Dude glares at Walter. Walter stares dumbly for a beat. The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat. Walter reaches one arm across the Dude's body to grab the laundry. There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. He flings it out the window. Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle. Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road. Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement. The car swerves and lurches, and the Dude, cursing, takes the wheel. Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper. The car rocks, and the Dude wrestles with the wheel. The car clunks and screams around in a skid. The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something. As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money, the Dude runs up the road toward the bridge, frantically waving the satchel in the air. WALTER is just rising from the ground, massaging an injured knee. The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away. He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs. The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap. Donny is trotting excitedly up. The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone. He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra. The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space. The Dude walks away across the lot.",
    "591": "Lightning flashes behind a skull-shaped cloud as it moves forward over the City of London, casting stormy reflections on a tall office building, where staff watch in alarm as the menacing clouds approach. The clouds produce three dark trails of smoke that swoop toward the Thames and Trafalgar Square, then swiftly move past Leicester Square tube station, down narrow alleys and through walls into Diagon Alley, igniting a shop and injuring people, as Death Eaters leave holding a man with a bag over his head. Two wear metal masks, while the third has a long face and beard. They zoom away and weave over the Millennium Bridge, which tilts, sways, and ultimately crashes into the Thames, flinging people and leaving only trails of smoke rising from the river. At Surbiton Railway Station, a pretty waitress smiles at Harry Potter, whose bloodied face appears as he puts down a paper, sniffs his breath, pops a mint into his mouth, and watches a train pass. Wiping condensation from the glass, his eyes fix on the opposite platform where he sees Professor Dumbledore standing in front of a Divine Magic Perfume billboard. Harry smiles, crosses over, and holds Dumbledore's left arm, noticing his blackened hand and rings as they spin away to a street. Dumbledore, with his left arm around Harry, leads him through a crowd of photographers flashing their cameras, and as they walk past a market cross, they continue down a dark street, stopping outside a detached house.",
    "105": "Mrs. Gump looks into a sitting room and informs the boarders about dinner. She looks into Forrest's room, hears singing coming from another room, and walks over to a closed door. Mrs. Gump opens the door, revealing a young man with long sideburns playing the guitar and singing. Meanwhile, Forrest holds onto a broom and dances oddly, his legs rocking back and forth to the guitar. The young man is Elvis Presley. Mrs. Gump leaves and closes the door as Elvis sits back down, and Forrest begins to dance again as Elvis plays and sings. Forrest stands left, looks at himself in a mirror, and continues dancing while watching himself. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a sidewalk and later watch television, where Elvis thrusts his hips and sings. Elvis dances in the same manner Forrest did, while a woman in the audience screams and applauds. Mrs. Gump walks away, pulling Forrest with her, and he stops to take one last look as Elvis continues performing on television. Forrest is still sitting on the bus bench, and a black nurse looks at him. Mrs. Gump and Forrest wait for the school bus, which pulls up as Mrs. Gump prepares Forrest for his first day of school. The bus driver opens the door, looks down, and smokes a cigarette, smiling as Forrest steps up into the bus. Mrs. Gump waves to Forrest as the bus drives away. Forrest begins to walk down the aisle, where two young boys look up from their seat. Forrest looks around while a larger girl slides over so he can't sit next to her, shaking her head. He looks to the other side where a boy sits alone on a larger seat, glaring up at Forrest. Forrest continues talking as he sits on the bus bench. Young Forrest is still standing in the aisle on the bus and looks back at Jenny Curran, a young girl about his age. Forrest sits down next to Jenny, who puts her hand out toward him. Forrest reaches over and shakes her hand. Young Jenny and Forrest run toward a large oak tree. Jenny sits on a large branch and calls down to Forrest, who dangles from the branch. Jenny and Forrest sit on a tree branch and read together. Forrest hangs upside down from a branch and swings back and forth, with his braces wedged in the tree. The silhouette of the oak tree shows Jenny and Forrest as they sit on a branch.",
    "149": "Walker is too entranced by the ceremony and the depth of layered emotions in Gandhi and Ba's voices and eyes to take notes as Ba and Gandhi come near to meeting. Ba takes the last step so that they are face to face, and for a moment, their eyes hold the many dreams, hopes, pain, and love of many years, while Walker watches with his face taut with emotion. Gandhi slowly lifts his hand, and both Walker and Collins, especially the overtly cynical American, are touched. Gandhi turns to them, and then a tiny, beautiful city rises steeply out of the Arabian Sea with buildings whose white walls are tinted amber and gold by the sun. Gandhi sits on a promontory watching the sunrise in solemn meditation and becomes aware of footsteps. He turns to see Walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder, and Gandhi smiles. Walker joins him, looking out over the bay and city, truly impressed, and looks down at Gandhi, who scowls up in the early light. They both watch the waves on the shore a moment, with the changing hues of the sunrise on the city's whites. Gandhi looks out to sea, intercut with images of Walker, the sea, and the town itself in the sun. Walker studies him as Gandhi reaches a profound insight, staring out to sea in reflection. Suddenly, Gandhi's head lifts, his eyes become alert, he feels excitement, and stands, his manner full of optimism. Walker stares at him and then at what Gandhi seems to be looking at, the waves below them. Walker turns back to Gandhi, puzzled, but cannot mistake the glow in Gandhi's face. Gandhi looks at him with a teasing smile, and his grin broadens as he starts briskly down the promontory, with Walker scrambling after him. Gulls fly over them in the growing light, and Gandhi turns from the sea to Walker, his eyes confident and elated, before continuing down the promontory. Still baffled, Walker glances at the sea and follows Gandhi. The waves run against the shore as he looks in astonishment at his principal secretary. His ADC, a general, a brigadier, and a senior police officer are with him, a new team holding the same offices. Irwin looks at him, trying to understand the act's significance, and the senior police officer helps.",
    "893": "Words appear. Wearing 50 black and white striped uniforms, prisoners march in lockstep single file across the dirt, each man holding the shoulders of the man in front. A prison guard in a dark blue overcoat squints at them as they pass, while nearby, one prisoner lies motionless at another guard's feet. The line of prisoners continues away from a wall 30 feet high, with guards on either side of them, as they march toward a stark building, where a smoke stack reaches into the sky. On a dirt road populated by a few rundown establishments, a Nash sedan stops. The driver's door opens and a tall man with bony features steps out wearing a badge. He opens the back door and helps a raven-haired man in handcuffs step out. Both wearing long overcoats, they walk across the street toward the prison. At the middle of a long high wall, a metal entry gate sits under a lookout tower. As they're near the entrance, the officer gives the convict a little shove. The metal gate opens. Just inside, an older guard opens a steel door. As the metal gate closes behind them, the two men pass the guard with no more than a nod from the arriving officer. Inside the prison, an inmate's central room is filled with work benches, each with its own sewing machine. A prisoner with graying temples lifts a box labeled Mayer Thread Company from a stack. As he carries it across the room, he glances at a presiding guard. With slight length, the inmate brings the box past another guard to a work bench. Reaching the bench, he joins a sandy-haired prisoner and sets the box down. They tear off the outer tape. Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pull out a gun, and using the spools to conceal them, pass them to the young inmate and a man sitting next to him. They stealthily tuck the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieve guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of work benches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts concealing his weapon and grabs one of the guards. The younger inmate punches another guard in the face and holds his gun to his throat. A stocky prisoner repeatedly strikes a guard with a pipe as the older inmate follows closely behind. Each of the escaping prisoners leads their hostage to the door. The rest of the befuddled inmates stand at their benches. The younger inmate jabs his captive in the gut. Now the newly arrived convict stands behind his presiding officer and another guard at a door.",
    "26": "He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his heart breaking. He's excited -- smiling. Carol holding a pose for Simon. He is holding a ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His style cramped by his cast. He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece from the cast, freeing his hand. He roars ironically, a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center. The door opens. Simon enters. Melvin is having a room service breakfast. Carol follows him out. Her arms are filled with the hotel soaps, shampoos, etc. Melvin reacts. Carol looks at Melvin. Simon finishes dialing the phone. He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to Carol and Melvin. Carol, a load has been lifted. Melvin stalks out. The car parked near a phone booth. Carol walks up to Simon in the car. She hands him a baseball cap. Melvin hangs up the phone. She shakes her head and walks off. The door opens, revealing them. Simon notices some of his paintings. Simon looking at Melvin with some sympathy. Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart. He sits in a chair still fully dressed. A beat then we hear Simon's whispered voice. As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche. As he speeds him out. She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than ever. We enter the room carrying Verdell who strains to be allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him. He moves for the door. stops suddenly, jolted. walks reluctantly into the apartment house. As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty. The windows open, reading one of Melvin's books. hesitates. looks at his watch. Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe. She walks to her wide open window and looks over. The convertible at the curb. She hesitates. As Melvin gives up and starts out. turning as the sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. He bolts for the door and enters. She opens the door. He reaches her side. He half turns to leave. that Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part. Carol has not ever heard anything like that before. Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone. She disappears into her room. She looks at him then. Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door. They walk quietly. Melvin still walking with his usual attention to where he steps. Melvin walking and though we can see an improvement it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines.",
    "1233": "Emily smiles and looks down shyly as Ben shuffles. She gives a little wave as Ben steps outside, and he shoots Emily a last look before shutting the door behind him. Ben goes to his car while Emily watches him through the window. Ben stands, looking out from his patio with breakers crashing on the beach where Sarah waves up to him, and tears roll down Ben's cheeks as he stands looking out to sea. Ben sits on rocks, then opens shutters in his beach house, fingers a rope of pearls, and studies a photo of himself and Sarah. He cleans his beach house, then sits glumly among a stack of packed boxes. Ben drives his car sedately along the wide and winding coast road, bathed in sunshine. At a motel, the receptionist, Larry, helps Ben carry gear to his room, where Ben uses a small hose to fill up a large cylindrical fish tank that Larry was carrying. Light from the tank illuminates Ben's face as he stands in the darkness, seemingly lost in thought. Ben, as a boy, gazes in awe into a tank of jellyfish with spindly, long tentacles; the jellyfish move hypnotically, with the glowing specter-like creatures drifting through the water, as he watches spellbound with his palms pressed against the tank. In the present, Michelle's husband, Dan, watches a box jellyfish in adult Ben's tank as Ben writes, signs a document, throws a notebook at Dan, and taps his own temple. Dan's expression darkens, and he edgily wipes his mouth, then his eyes. He glares at Ben and falters before he starts to speak and paces the motel room tearfully. Ben enters a crowded waiting room full of women and children, standing and staring across at a bespectacled middle-aged woman sitting in a glass-fronted office. Her mouth drops open when she sees him, and Ben waves to her and smiles. The woman hurries out to him, and Holly hugs him tightly before stepping back. Holly keeps a photo of herself and Ben on her desk in the open-plan office. Ben sits with her as Holly's eyes glisten with tears while she stares at him; he eyes her steadily and smiles faintly. She considers and looks at him reassuringly. In a dilapidated area, Ben sits in his car watching a house. Connie cleans a window of the house, and Ben approaches the window and smiles at Connie, who opens the front door but not the wrought iron screen door before letting him in. A little boy of about eight and a slightly older girl are in the living room, playing cards and listening as Ben sits down, and the children listen as they play.",
    "972": "David walks on, and they accompany him. David eyes the boyish officer who promptly closes his map book, and under David’s unwavering gaze, Richardson frowns a little. David crosses the street to a bistro, while the boyish aide checks his book. The Adjustment officers watch David stride briskly outside. Now, David stands by the curb and hails an approaching cab, but its roof light switches to off duty as it drives by. David tries again, but a mini-van taxi ignores him. David jogs out into the opposite lane, waving high for another cab that passes him up. Richardson and his aide stand casually by as David jogs away, and they swap a thoughtful look. In his dress shoes, David sprints after a cab, and as the cabbie waves and slows, a sedan crashes into his passenger side. David runs over to the damaged cars, glances to the sedan driver who checks the bloody-faced cabbie, and then checks on the other driver. David makes a call and goes to another cop, but the rebuffed cop looks to Richardson, then walks away. They both look aside, but find no one. David strides off, leaving an ambulance and a squad car behind. He checks his watch, takes a few more brisk steps, then breaks into a run. A taxi stops, and as they near a traffic light, it changes from green to red, and the surrounding cars stop. A man and a woman in the crosswalk scurry out of their way. David sees Richardson and his aide emerge from a door, and the taxi leaves the Adjustment Bureau servants behind. In a pub, the officers detour through a side door which ports them to a street, and the hostess hurries after them, but finds only a coat closet. The Bureau officers try a residential door, but find Central Park on the other side. They race up the steps of a townhouse, and as David's cab cruises through another intersection, the Bureau officers run through an art gallery, bumping a bystander. Heading outside, they see David exit the cab and enter a building. Richardson's hat blows off, and as Richardson enters, David opens a door and sees Elise executing a graceful sidestep. Richardson catches his breath and makes eye contact with David as the boyish aide hands him a cellphone. As Richardson walks off, David's gaze returns to Elise, who partners with a man holding her waist in one hand. Elise balances on one foot, bends over, and briefly flutters her other foot high behind her. As the male dancer dips in a far stepping lunge, Elise rolls fluidly over his back. David enters the studio, and outside, Richardson walks beside a marble facade, pulls open a brass lobby door, and disappears into a midcentury high-rise, its windows' numbers in the hundreds ascending into the sky, story after story after story.",
    "152": "A little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play as the crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky. Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them, accompanied by a newsreel truck and crew riding along about two-thirds of the way back, followed by a car of cameramen and reporters at the end. Gandhi looks at Walker, walking a few paces behind him at the side of the procession, wiping sweat from his face. Gandhi smiles, turns back, shakes his head, and grins as he passes by the policemen and into the cheers of the crowd. As the procession trails into the village, several villagers with knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders run around the police and join the end of the procession. Gandhi stands in the center of the wildly cheering crowd as the camera pulls back and back, and the shot becomes black and white while we hear the music of Movietone News. With that, we see the Movietone Music tag, and as the film fades, the lights go up on a couple of civil servants moving about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin stares at the blank screen set up in his office, surrounded by the general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's ADC, and the principal secretary. The two men who ran the projector quietly dismantle it. Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets but answers the implied questions, as Irwin sighs and nods. For the first time, Irwin is truly angry, and his face falls. Meanwhile, men, women, and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables. A group of policemen barge into the room, knocking tables, salt, and paper in every direction with their lathis, and seize some of the volunteers for arrest. In the chaos, an old man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet. Nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street, loaded with boxes containing salt packets, and he and eight or nine others are selling them to the people who flock about the truck. The sound of horses is heard, and Nehru lifts his head as mounted Indian police come down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center. Some of the people run, while others deliberately stand fast as the mounted police converge on the truck. Nehru is grabbed and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street, and one of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman.",
    "453": "As he says that, a R.O.U.S comes flying at him from off-screen. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off. He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the R.O.U.S is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly rodent clear. Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.O.U.S. stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for Buttercup, and she's scared to death. And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp, something we hadn't expected: Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. Three warriors, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion. Westley looks worse. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. Westley and Buttercup are staring out at the others. Buttercup, looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye, and we see an armed warrior, in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart. Buttercup looks the other way. Another warrior has a crossbow aimed at Westley. Buttercup frantically stares around, and now a third warrior, crossbow stretched and ready to shoot, is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try. Humperdinck whirls to face her. Westley also whirls to face her. Buttercup talks to them both. Buttercup and Westley stare deep into each other's eyes. Westley is dazed. Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go. Westley stares after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and holds it in his hand. Westley looks at him. Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley starts to fall—the screen goes black. Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless. Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication. He puts it down and begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces. From the Albino: a nod. From the Albino: a shake of the head. He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad. Buttercup's face is also sad. Pallid, perhaps ill, she wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor, Prince Humperdinck and Count Rugen watch her as they move on. The camera holds on it while we hear the Grandfather's voice reading. And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen, and the Queen stand high on the balcony.",
    "1150": "The scene starts with a spider that lands on a desk and then on a boy's head before crawling up a girl's arm. Moody flicks his wand, making the spider hover over Ron, and then it drops into Ron's hair. The spider clamps itself on Draco's face and hits the glass. Controlled by Moody's wand, the spider hovers helplessly over a bucket of water before Moody directs it to the palm of his hand. Neville puts up his hand and steps towards the table as the spider writhes in agony. Neville looks distraught, with his face twisted in anger. Hermione cries out, and Moody lowers his wand, withdrawing the curse. Neville's eyes are tight shut, and his face is clammy. Moody places the spider in front of Hermione, who shakes her head. A flash of green light occurs, and the spider dies. Moody's mad eye swivels to stare at Harry, who looks up warily. Moody nervously licks his lips and takes a swig from his hip flask, while Harry regards him thoughtfully. Leaving the classroom, Ron follows Hermione and Harry down a circular stone staircase, and Moody appears as they spot a sad figure. Neville reluctantly follows Moody back up the stairs. Rain runs like tears down the face of a woman in a stained-glass window, and students splash across the courtyard with cloaks over their heads to protect themselves from the rain. The goblet of fire stands in the great hall, and eligible students cross the circle of light around it, placing their names into the blue flame. Cedric Diggory's supporters push him forward, and he steps through the circle to put his name into the goblet, while Ron gives him an encouraging wave. Fred and George run into the hall in triumph, swallow the contents of a test tube, and jump inside the circle to put their names into the goblet but are engulfed in blue flames and flung out of the circle with white hair and long, white beards. They grapple with each other, rolling over on the stone floor. Hermione shakes her head, sits on the stone steps, and opens a book. Accompanied by a Durmstrang student and their teacher, Karkaroff, Viktor Krum approaches the circle confidently, with a serious look, and puts his name into the goblet, catching Hermione's eye as he turns away. She gives him a faint, admiring smile. The students assemble excitedly in the great hall as Dumbledore raises his hand, causing the flames of the burning torches around the hall to gradually die down one by one, and everyone looks expectant. Dumbledore approaches the goblet of fire with his arm outstretched as the blue flame turns red, and a piece of charred parchment flutters down into his hand.",
    "283": "Jeff's eyes are staring intently at the backyard over the coffee cup, then stray upward as he puts it down. Stella turns and walks into the kitchen, and Jeff's eyes move down again. Abstractedly, his hand reaches for a piece of bacon, but he pushes the food away and picks up the coffee cup instead. Miss Torso, in a ballet outfit, is hanging up a small wash consisting mostly of lingerie on a clothesline while doing her inevitable leg practice. Jeff appears to be getting a bit listless or bored from constantly watching Thorwald's apartment, so his eyes wander around the neighborhood and end up looking toward the newlywed's apartment. He smiles affectionately and starts to turn away, but something startles him, and he looks quickly back as the shade goes up in the newlywed's apartment. The young husband, wearing only pajama bottoms because of the heat, leans on the windowsill, looking out with satisfaction, revealing he is a well-muscled, attractive young man. Jeff's head snaps toward the center of his window as Stella appears behind his wheelchair. Two men in tan coveralls stand outside Thorwald's door, one of them carrying a clipboard. Thorwald's hair is disheveled, and he is unshaved. He opens the door, admits the two men after a short exchange, and leaves it open behind them. Stella and Jeff watch intently as Jeff feels alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars. A close view shows the men carrying a trunk across Thorwald's living room toward the corridor. Jeff lowers the binoculars quickly, turns over his shoulder to watch Stella as she moves toward the door. She calls back to him while already going up the steps. The salesman speaks to the operator, while Jeff lowers the binoculars and takes a normal view of the alleyway, momentarily blocked by a freight truck. After the trucks part, only the back half of the freight truck is visible before it pulls out of sight. The hood and cab of the truck are seen as another truck moves across from the left. Jeff quickly raises the binoculars, holding them just in time to see a puffing and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. Another truck crosses from the left by the time the binoculars are up.",
    "722": "Snoop Dog glides into a room where the remains of a wooden bed lie collapsed on the floor. Another eel swims past a porcelain bathtub as Snoop Dog pivots toward a broken door lying in the silt. The bearded man grasps the two joysticks as Snoop Dog extends a pair of mechanical claws to move the door aside, uncovering a square object. The brown-haired man squints as he studies a video monitor, and the silt settles to reveal an unopened safe. On the ocean surface, a research vessel outfitted with cranes plucks the submersibles out of the water, and men cheer as a winch raises a net holding the safe to the surface. Lewis uncorks a bottle of champagne and sprays everyone while a crewman opens the safe with a cutting wheel. A man pulls off the door, unleashing a flood of muddy water. As a cameraman films him, Brock kneels and pulls out wads of sodden papers, removes a muddy ledger, and tosses it aside before emptying the safe, scowling as he stands. Later, Brock takes a phone call while nearby lab techs clean the muddy papers, revealing a sketch of a woman reclining on a settee, wearing a large pendant around her neck. Brock studies a photograph of a pendant necklace with a heart-shaped gem, the same necklace the woman in the drawing is wearing. Elsewhere, in a home, a young, long-haired woman walks past a small dog as she carries teacups to a table, and in an adjoining sunroom, a white-haired woman uses a pottery wheel. Leaning on a cane, the older woman steps toward a small television set in a nearby kitchen. Brock stands on the research area using a satellite phone. Holding the small white dog on her lap, Rose and the young woman ride inside a helicopter as it flies out to the research ship, where Brock and Lewis move to a railing as the helicopter approaches. They move towards the landing pad as the helicopter touches down, and a crewman unloads several suitcases and a large trunk. Rose shakes Brock's hand, and the long-haired woman smiles and pushes Rose away in a wheelchair. A man aboard the helicopter hands a fishbowl to Brock. Later, Rose sets framed photographs beside the fishbowl. In the lab, Rose peers down at the clean sketch resting in a container of clear liquid, then closes her eyes. A blonde man with a few stray locks over his eyes sketches the drawing. Rose smiles as she picks up the silver hand mirror, turns the mirror in her hands, catching her own reflection in the cracked glass, sets down the mirror, and examines other objects. She picks up a silver and glass hair comb adorned with an ornamental insect with outstretched wings.",
    "587": "A cassette labeled Soul Funk number two plays on the stereo as Whip lies back with a pack of ice on his knee. He picks up a glass of whiskey as Nicole, fresh from taking a shower, exits the bathroom. She picks up a cushion and, carrying the pillow, walks to Whip, kneels down beside him, and removes the ice pack from his knee. She lifts his leg and places the cushion under it and massages his knee. Whip is laid back in the armchair watching as Nicole's hands move up to cover his hand. He raises the glass as if to take a drink but stops midway. Nicole hesitates, her gaze steady on him; then she takes the glass from his hand and sets it carefully on the nearby table. She pushes herself towards him and they kiss. They look into each other's eyes and their lips meet again. The next morning Whip watches Nicole as she briefly stirs in her sleep; then Whip looks up and rises off the bed. Outside, Hugh gets out of a car. Whip steps onto the veranda holding his cane and a gun. Hugh partially raises his hands. Hugh and Whip climb a platform near the church where a small congregation listens to a sermon in a cordoned off area. Hugh takes a pair of binoculars and watches a woman step out of a black SUV. Whip watches as reporters and officials wander around the wreckage and then clenches his jaw. Carr stands at the far end of the large conference table opposite Charlie, then pushes through the double glass doors and walks towards Whip, who stands. Whip forces a smile and drinks straight from a whiskey bottle. He watches a home video of his father and son playing football. Nicole walks in the door and watches him. He increases the volume on the TV. Nicole has not moved since she walked in and watches Whip try to stand, and then, fall. He lies prone on the carpet; Nicole covers her mouth with her hand as Whip has passed out. Nicole removes the cigarette from his fingers and adjusts his head so he can breathe easily. Nicole covers Whip with a blanket, then turns off the video and switches off the light. Nicole sits in a chair on the veranda taking pictures as Whip steps out in a bathrobe and ambles toward her. He sits in a rocking chair, smiles at her, places a cigarette in his mouth and picks up her camera. He picks up a book from the coffee table between them, points to some open land, and Nicole puffs on her cigarette and nods. Whip points the camera at her. At a church, a large framed picture of Katerina stands surrounded by flowers as a coffin is carried out.",
    "862": "In a series of events, a man drops a tray and quickly picks it up as he runs from a church. Valjean is then brought back to the church, where the bishop, noticing this, hands him two candlesticks and places his hand on Valjean's head. A tomb with carvings of two Christified figures is nearby as Valjean kneels at the altar with papers in his hand, and blood stains his temple where he was hit. Having walked away from the altar, he returns to it, sinking to his knees before striding out of the church, ripping his papers to shreds as he goes to the far corner of the churchyard, throwing the pieces into the air. The church, located in a walled village on a hill, witnesses a piece of paper flying high into the air towards the sun. Meanwhile, Javert, in uniform, rides in the rain ahead of four other horsemen as they enter the city. In a dark cobbled slum, a woman takes the wrapped body of a child from a weeping mother, while in a factory, a worker snatches a note from Fantine, who tries to retrieve it. Valjean, now clean-shaven with dark neatly trimmed hair and smartly dressed to look like a gentleman, glances up to see Javert gazing down at the factory floor, which unnerves Valjean, causing him to walk away from the women. The foreman throws Fantine onto the street, flinging coins at her. In a courtyard, Valjean sees another uniformed horseman accompanying Javert, who paces inside an office. Valjean slowly makes his way up the stairs, and the two men bow to one another. Javert removes his hat and hands a paper to Valjean, who in turn gives Javert a rosary, prompting Javert to lower his gaze. They rush out onto the cobbled street where a man is trapped under a cart, and Valjean crouches beside him as Javert watches. Valjean grimaces but manages to lift the cart off the trapped man, which makes Javert's eyes narrow. After dropping the shaft, Javert hesitates, then bows his head and turns away. Later, Fantine walks quickly along the streets, passing people standing in the darkness, while tightly wrapping a shawl around her. She stops and stares forlornly before passing a man smoking a long pipe and seated women, then approaches a scruffy man. Fantine's sleek, long dark hair is cut, and she is held down as a tooth extractor is pushed into her mouth. A silver-haired man appears, and Fantine drinks from a small bottle, placing her hand in a man's who is wearing a captain's hat. The captain then pushes her down, turns her over, and slowly raises the hem of her dress.",
    "308": "Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. Evan sighs and gives up. Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale. Seven-year-old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason. Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat. Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings. Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively guarding his food. Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house. In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall. Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror. Evan walks past some junkies and enters, stepping over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel. He knocks on a door, and Kayleigh, now a haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes. She looks around, waves him in. The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls, and brown-spotted squares of tin foil. His eyes begin to water. Kayleigh eyes the wallet, opens Evan's wallet, and leaves a twenty on the table. She gets up, puts on her coat, tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him, and leaves. Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked gothic co-ed on Evan's bed. Evan's temper flares, and he picks up a chair and smashes it against a wall above Thumper's head. Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox. Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and Tommy shrugs and follows after him. Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but with no major injuries. Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail. The blast is deafening, and Evan's body is hurled backwards dramatically. Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same. Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand. We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up from the age of thirteen with no arms.",
    "883": "Mary prepares to play, and the men quickly take their places opposite their partners; as the music starts, the ladies curtsy and the men bow, while a group of onlookers gather. Mrs. Bennet turns to glare at her husband as the men stand in one line with the ladies opposite them, briefly touching hands as they move around the other dancers. Mrs. Gardiner crosses the room and sees Charlotte and Jane sitting down; Charlotte is busy chatting with someone, but Jane looks quietly upset. Later, the girl with red hair is standing with Wickham as Charlotte and Lizzie look on. Wickham smiles at Lizzie as he takes the girl's hand and leads her down through the column of dancers; Lizzie smiles back at him, then turns to look at Charlotte, who has a serious expression on her face. Lizzie turns her attention back to the dance floor where the red-haired girl is eyeing Wickham coyly. Charlotte grabs Lizzie's arm as Mary King continues to dance with Wickham, smiling contentedly. Winter has arrived, and the ground outside Longbourn is crisp with a white layer of frost, while Lizzie reads a letter; Jane walks out, then is sitting looking out of her window. A carriage pulls up, and Caroline gets out, then climbs back into her carriage, which sets off down the street as Jane stares dolefully out of her window. Back at Longbourn, Lizzie lowers her sister's letter with a pained expression. It's a mild, sunny day, and Lizzie is taking a walk in a field near Longbourn. She wanders past post and rail fencing surrounding an old oak tree, idly toying with a leafy twig, and as she reaches the grounds of Longbourn, she tosses the twig away and wanders up the graveled driveway to the house, with a pensive, yet carefree air, her face framed by the straw brim of her gold-colored bonnet. Lydia comes running out to meet her in the garden, and they continue on past the gardener, who's busily pruning a bush; Lizzie casually reaches out to a branch above her head and pulls off a leaf. Indoors, Mr. Bennet is reading. Hearing a noise from the hall, he looks up from his book to see trunks being moved and Lizzie standing in her coat and bonnet. She comes in to see him, goes over to him, and he takes her hand and kisses it. He watches her leave with an endearing smile, then goes back to his book. Lizzie is sharing her carriage with Maria and Sir William Lucas as the horse-drawn carriage continues on past the green canopy of trees. Eventually, it pulls through the gates and into the drive of a sizable, ivy-clad house, where Mr. Collins and Charlotte hurry out to meet them as Lizzie, Maria, and Sir William emerge from the cab.",
    "287": "Thorwald completes his call and returns to the bedroom with a handbag, which he slides under a pile of coats on the bed. Footsteps approach Jeff's apartment, and as he lowers his camera lens, Lisa stands silhouetted in the doorway, black-lighted by the corridor lights. Jeff, with his back more toward the neighborhood, is initially turned toward her but abruptly turns back to the window as Lisa dashes behind him. The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and he pours himself a drink in the living room, looking down into the garden nonchalantly before stopping quickly. Jeff turns back to the window, and Thorwald puts down his unfinished drink, goes to the door, turns off the light in the living room, and exits. He walks briskly down the corridor while Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection as Lisa moves toward him. As Lisa turns on the lights in the apartment, it's revealed she is wearing an extravagantly beautiful dress. Jeff turns to face the room, talking as Lisa animatedly moves, and Jeff watches her pace with an oversized handbag prominently on the table. The camera closes in as Lisa stops and faces Jeff, then eases back as she comes over to him with sparkling eyes and tense concentration. Jeff pulls her into his lap, and she puts her arms around him, appearing very happy as she kisses his cheek. Jeff moves back to look her in the eye, there's a pause, and she cuts him off with a series of kisses. Lisa then gets up, laughs, goes to the handbag on the table, and returns to sit in Jeff's lap, displaying the bag's contents. It is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case, opened to reveal a compact set of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and other necessities for a comfortable overnight stay.",
    "416": "The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson house. They sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's hand touching her shoulder. There is a squeal of tires as Ben almost drives off the road. Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside the door. They start in a few steps. One of the car parkers passes them on his way out. The camera begins to pull up and away. A bellboy passes them. The room clerk smiles at them. Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the lobby. The camera pulls back to a high overhead shot revealing many people moving back and forth in the lobby, passing Ben and Elaine. Ben brings Elaine through the door to the porch. Ben and Elaine are in his car. He takes his hand off the ignition, jams on the accelerator, and drives the car speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes. He turns off the ignition and the lights. He puts his head down on the steering wheel. He lifts his head. She nods. He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. He freezes with his hand still on the key. He turns off the engine. He starts the car and drives out. It is raining. On the seat beside Ben is a package. From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift. Ben's right hand is on it as he drives past Ben and through the windshield as the Robinson house comes closer and closer. The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passenger side, and climbs in. Ben starts the car forward down the driveway as they drive. Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block. There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression. Then he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on his side, and jumps out of the car, carrying the package. Track with Ben as he runs up the street and up the driveway toward the Robinson house. Ben gets to the front door. Ben runs up the stairs. He still carries the package. Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom. She is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe. Ben pushes her back into her room. Ben turns and looks. Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house. He holds her against the wall in the corner. Back in the corner.",
    "913": "Two other women sit at a table, with one writing and the other looking out the window, while a large man in suspenders peers through the blinds, then turns away and hurries out of the room. Outside, Dillinger and his men step out of their car, greeted by a young blonde woman, whom Dillinger grins at and kisses before they head inside. Later, in a garage, Dillinger sits across from a gunsmith who is disassembling a Tommy gun, removing the trigger handle and pulling out a coil. Outside the window behind the gunsmith, two cars arrive as Red steps out of the safe house. Dillinger glances at the door where the blonde nods to him, prompting him to get up and leave the garage. As Dillinger crosses to the house, he tosses a set of keys to Pete, who joins Red to inspect the new cars. Inside, Dillinger enters the kitchen where a man leans against the refrigerator and a woman smokes at the table. Dillinger washes his hands, hands the man a stuffed envelope, goes around the table, and kisses the woman's cheek before leaving the kitchen. Three men in fedoras and overcoats ascend a wide staircase with two center railings separating them. At the top, Dillinger stops to scan a huge bank with angular walls lined with pillars, then his two cohorts split off. Pete approaches a guard, bashes his face, and knees him in the gut. With Tommy gun in hand, Dillinger gracefully hurtles a counter and grabs a middle-aged man, rips the back of his collar, and parades the bank president around the counter and across the floor, passing a trembling customer. Dillinger pushes the president forward to a metal gate as one of his men collects cash from a teller. The president sorts keys, but Dillinger smacks him in the head with his pistol and points it in his face, prompting the president to return to the door. A robber elbows open a teller cage while the teller frantically gathers cash. Pete hops up on the counter, aiming his machine gun. Outside, Homer discreetly holds a rifle at his side, sees an arriving police car, and backs into a recess by a set of double doors, knocking with the butt of his rifle. Inside the bank, Dillinger waits as the president fills a sack with money from the safe. In a getaway car, Red checks the time on a pocket watch, then drives away. As policemen run across the street toward the bank, Red's car approaches, and Homer casually glances over. Inside, Dillinger pushes the president forward, notices a few dollars in change on the counter, and faces the customer it belongs to.",
    "1019": "A shower with steamy glass doors obscures the view of a couple having sex. As the woman gets out, her partner follows. A title appears with an arrow pointing at the woman's face. The man then opens the door and finds an adolescent girl with a massive golden-brown curl sleeping face-down in bed. In a t-shirt and boxers, he lumbers over to the bed and lightly touches her arm. As she lies unresponsive, he barrages her with lazy slaps, and she reaches a hand out. He kisses her cheek. Later, he lies close to a little blonde girl and kisses her cheek, then carries her down the hall. The older girl makes bacon and scrambled eggs as her father brings in big, colorful balloons. He sneaks some bacon, drinks OJ from the plastic jug, and eats a cupcake. His youngest sets off a confetti shooter. In another room, the wife and mother sits at a window with a towel over her hair and smokes a cigarette with a latex-gloved hand. Meanwhile, her family hangs streamers, sets out presents, and puts candles shaped like the number 38 on a cake. Putting the cigarette out, she uncovers her hair, removes the glove, pops gum in her mouth, pats her face and hands with a wipe, and sprays herself with perfume. She then leans into the kitchen, and the youngest shoots confetti. She blows out her birthday candles. Later, the girls sit on a couch a few yards from the kitchen island where their parents relax. Sayid stabs his older companion. Their father takes a cup of berries to the sink and faces his wife, running water over the cupcake. Now in the room, the younger daughter plays a larger keyboard, while her sister throws clothes at a closet. Wearing biking gear, he kisses her goodbye then sneaks over to the kitchen sink, extracting the cupcake from a soggy bed of scrambled eggs, and unwraps the tainted treat. He glances toward the open front door, then takes a bite. A lanky man leads the woman and a plump brunette up an outdoor flight of stairs at a brisk jog, with the brunette lagging behind. A goateed man bicycles with the father, and a car darts out and nearly hits them. His wife does crunches as the plump woman bounces on a stability ball. Barb's features pinch up, and he affects a lonely, pitiful gaze in a coffeehouse where Pete gives an earnest nod. In an SUV, he sings to his wife. Her sister grabs at the tablet. In a shopping district, as Debbie approaches Jodi, Pete smiles at stunning Desi, who works on a ladder, while Jodi nods behind her large, round glasses.",
    "930": "Mathis hands him an envelope. Tousle-headed Bond puts down his champagne glass and heads back to the bedroom. He kisses her naked back. She smiles and turns her face towards him. He pulls her back down onto a bed. DJ plays under a full moon. Trays are being served and cocktails sipped. A Range Rover pulls up at the entrance. Bond gets out, accompanied by Fields in a glamorous black and gold dress. He moves through the press of glamorous party-goers. He shakes another hand. CIA agent Felix watches from a sofa. They look down from a stone balustrade. She kisses him and he shoves her hard against the crumbling stonework. The thin German arrives. Fields passes. The CIA men are sitting together. He belts up as he goes around to the driver's side of the Range Rover. Motorcyclists follow them. He parks the car. The two motorcycle cops pull up behind. Bond hands over his license to the cop who is wearing dark glasses at night. As he opens it, the cop draws. Mathis is lying in the trunk. Bond pulls the unconscious man out. With his colleague’s gun, throws the other down, calmly shoots him and empties the gun and tosses it aside. Bond cradles him in his arms. Camille watches them. His head slumps against Bond's shoulder. Expressionlessly, Bond feels for a pulse. Camille shifts uneasily. He drops the body in a dumpster, removes Mathis’ wallet from his jacket, takes out the cash, and tosses the wallet aside. They walk off, leaving the body slumped amid the rubbish bags in the dumpster. The Range Rover heads down a desert highway. M stares coldly. The Range Rover drives through the dusty, barren. It arrives at a small airstrip. The man, in a leather jacket and brimmed hat, is. He turns as Bond his jacket to cover a bloodstain on his shirt. Bond looks at an old propeller transport plane as Camille gets out of the car. The ageing DC-3 Dakota lumbers down the runway, raising a cloud of dust in it. The man in a hat is already on the phone as the old plane takes to the air. A fighter streaks past them and banks for another pass. Bond puts the plane into the dive, working the controls furiously as the fighter loops to get behind them. The fighter streaks in. Bond flies down into a valley. Camille looks alarmed, and Bond concentrates hard as they skim the valley floor. He lowers the undercarriage. They hit the ground hard. He pulls the throttle back open. The fighter hurtles down the valley after them, perilously close to a rocky outcrop. Fields gets out of her seat and moves down the plane's fuselage.",
    "1194": "Barely visible, a Golden Snitch flutters past. Lightning sets the broomstick of a Gryffindor player on fire. Wearing goggles as protection from the rain, Harry swoops past the stand where the professors follow the action. He keeps close behind the Hufflepuff seeker as they both spot the Golden Snitch. As Diggory reaches out to grab it, lightning catapults him backwards on his broomstick. Harry peers into the hazy clouds. Looming above him, they form the menacing shape of a huge, black dog. He hovers for a moment until the Golden Snitch appears in front of him. He makes a grab for it but it zooms sharply away. Harry swerves back to follow it. As he reaches out, thick ice begins to form on the handle of his broomstick. He shakes his head as his goggles freeze over. An ominous black shape flaps past, a lost umbrella tossed by the ferocious wind. Ghastly figures swirl towards him out of the lowering storm clouds. Harry finds himself surrounded by hooded Dementors. He twists and turns to avoid them. He is catapulted backwards. A Dementor looms over Harry and opens its great mouth as if to suck his energy. Harry loses his grip on the broomstick and falls, helplessly, down through the clouds. Spectators watch in horror as he hurtles towards the ground. Dumbledore uses a spell to break his fall. The hospital wing. Harry opens his eyes. Harry's snowy owl, Hedwig, flies along the valley. The bird approaches the school in a heavy snowstorm and sails past the clock tower. Behind the clock face, Harry looks down as his friends set off without him to visit Hogsmeade. Footprints appear in the snow. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, grab Harry under his invisibility cloak. He taps the blank parchment with his wand. Harry opens the map. The images disappear. A heavy fleck stone slowly rises. Harry finds himself in the cellar at Honeydukes. Wearing his invisibility cloak, he climbs a wooden staircase. Honeydukes' busy sweet shop is full of Hogwarts students choosing confectionary. Neville's red lollipop is snatched from his hand and flips out into the street. Ron and Hermione are close to a shabby house. A snowball hits Malfoy. Another snowball flies out of the forest. Malfoy and his cronies look around for their invisible attacker. One loses his trousers. Another is swung round by his scarf. Malfoy is dragged by his feet towards the Shrieking Shack. Malfoy scrambles to his feet and runs away, followed by his cronies. Harry becomes visible. Ron and Hermione follow his footprints to the pub, but are not allowed inside. Harry looks shocked. He leaves the pub. Hermione sees his footprints. A group of elves are knocked aside.",
    "84": "The scene opens with the bottom of the stairs visible as John gasps, peering upward. Preacher looks at John, who sinks onto the edge of a chair as Preacher sits opposite. A bar of light from the door falls across Preacher's face, and John reacts with a questioning helplessness. John remains still, realizes his own folly, covers his mouth with his hand, and looks up at Preacher, then stiffens, relaxes, and chuckles softly. John starts for the stairs, which vibrate and move out of shot with the sound of a receding engine, disclosing Icey's skirts in the background. They appear spic-and-span, even wearing shoes, and wave bewilderedly after the car. She hustles out of the shot as his hand clamps over her mouth. She struggles and whimpers. His hand rises as she puts out her own, expecting a loving hand-clasp, but Preacher points to the window. Startled, then tender, she moves to adjust the shade, always looking toward the bed, smiling maternally. As the shot pulls back and pans into a full shot of the bed, she approaches, sits on the edge, and slips off her mules while Preacher turns, his back to her, with a sounding of bedsprings. His voice is quiet and cold as Willa puts her face down on the pillow and moans. Preacher snaps on a harsh bare bulb in the center of the room; she obeys. Willa hesitates, walks to the mirror, meets her image, her head dropping. In a head close-up, Willa is seen with the bulb hanging at the center, and Preacher, in his nightshirt, stands beyond it. Her mouth trembles, unable to speak, merely opening her mouth. He watches her for a moment, then snaps off the light and gets into bed. Willa, in darkness, remains motionless, folds her hands in prayer, and lifts her eyes. It lies face-down on the arbor bricks, back wide open, money spilling out as a little breeze toys with it, alongside the sound of snipping heard off-screen. The camera tilts upward to a view where she, at the end of the grape-arbor, finishes cutting a skirted paper doll out of a hundred-dollar bill and lays it beside a male hundred-dollar paper doll, which she pats. Pearl starts guiltily, looks toward him, scrambling the money together as John's footsteps are heard off-screen. As he stoops toward her, dumb with horror, she continues gathering the money. He stands at the far end of the arbor, where Preacher's watch-chain gleams. The shot slowly closes down on it until stillness as the paper dolls blow past him. John starts to laugh uncontrollably, experiencing a helpless reaction, and he holds his hands out to her. She comes to his lap, dropping her doll at his feet.",
    "141": "Sir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive as he picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily Chronicle; he looks at Sir Edward and sighs heavily. Sir Edward stares back, then drops the paper back on his desk, and Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward, then at the document on the secretary's desk. The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him, and Sir George looks at it like a snake. The secretary picks up a pen and offers it; after a second, Sir George takes the pen and signs angrily. Meanwhile, Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet and turns, offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal. Gandhi grins, dismissing the formality and again grins at the extravagance, followed by a polite little laugh. Jinnah introduces him, and Gandhi makes the pranam, studying him with interest after that comment, while Azad gives a gentle salaam. Gandhi turns, and he stands, awaiting Gandhi's attention, noting that all the others have been dressed in European clothes, but the handsome Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic much like the one that Gandhi once wore. For a moment Gandhi studies the costume, then a broad smile; he looks at Gandhi. Again the temper of it produces a little silence. He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with a silver service of tea. Of them all, Nehru's manner is the most naturally patrician, and Jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it. His stand has produced a little shock of surprise, and holding his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile, as they all look at him with some surprise. As he speaks, he rises and walks to the servant; they all stare at him, startled by his words and the fervor with which he speaks to them. He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him. As it sinks in, Gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- first to Jinnah, and it impresses each one of them, but for all his impact, they still take the measure of him with caution. Patel is the first to recognize the implications, and the idea has caught hold as Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly. His firmness doesn't restore Kinnoch's normal aplomb, and he holds the telegrams forward, glancing at the general. That takes the wind out of all of them as grimly, Lord Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and gardens. A prison door opens, and Gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along a small corridor to a room where the door is held open by a prison guard.",
    "1201": "Marley noses open the plastic bin and guzzles water from the toilet, then trots back into the bedroom, settles himself on his bed, and enjoys a scratch before lying down. Heavily pregnant, Jenny stirs in bed. Marley pricks up his ears, trots to the bedside, and watches as she sits up suddenly, clutching her stomach. Marley jumps on the bed and watches as Jenny hurriedly packs some clothes. John lifts the car seat box down from the top of a cupboard, which Marley munches open. John leaves Marley playing happily with a big chewy bone and hurries out of the house, while Marley remains busy with the bone as the sun comes up and through the day, until he falls asleep on the floor. John arrives home alone, and they walk out of the back door onto their wooden decking. John sits wearily on the steps as Marley sniffs around nearby. Jenny is indoors with the baby in a carry seat. Marley jumps up at the table with the baby on it, and John gets Marley to sit as Jenny lifts the baby out of the carrier. Marley offers up a welcoming paw. On the pavement, the Grogans' bin is surrounded by chewed empty boxes of baby equipment, and John, accompanied by Marley, comes out of the house with another bin bag as the bin men arrive. They jump to save Marley from the attentions of toddler Patrick. On the beach, John sits with Marley under a palm tree. The big dog sits calmly and watches as a young couple kiss and cuddle on the sand, while John notices the dog watching them and wistfully chews a toothpick as Marley lies down on the sand. In the evening, John and Marley drive up to the house with the headlights on. Marley's looking out of the rear passenger window. From the driver's seat, John looks up and sees Jenny through a window, cuddling Patrick and singing to him. She notices the car, shows Patrick, and waves to her husband, who waves back with a smile. Marley is splayed out on the sofa, watching them. Later, Marley bounds out of the house with John holding his leash. John stops and looks around the nighttime street, noticing a slim teenage girl standing by her car in her driveway and clutching her side. She nods tearfully. They drive through a plush neighborhood, where John lets Patrick out of his car seat. Marley power slides through the house and into the pool. Jenny is staring into the bathroom mirror and leads John into the bathroom, where there are four positive pregnancy tests in the sink. John half smiles and nods hesitantly. The neighborhood features golf courses with sand bunkers, and most of the houses have pools at the rear.",
    "810": "They all sit at the table, and Cala serves food. Ferris looks at the boys, and Rowley shakes his head gravely. Ferris looks to the boys again, and Yousef nods in approval of the next dish, which Aisha notices. Cala looks at the boys and points, causing Aisha to look at Cala, worried. She waves a white napkin, and he smiles and raises his eyebrows at Aisha as they walk out to the street. He holds out his hand, and Aisha smiles and looks up to a window where Cala is looking down at them. Ferris waves to her, and without shaking hands, Ferris goes. Aisha wrings her hands as she looks up at people leaning out of windows, watching her. Hani gives Ferris photographs of Al-Masri and Sadiki with young women in a club, and Hani lights a cigar. Ferris frowns earnestly as Hani looks at a grandfather clock, while Ferris's eyes dart. He smiles and holds up the file of photographs. Garland works on a computer and stretches his arms above his head. At the military airbase, a chopper lands in front of a hangar, where pale light glows in the windows and casts a sheen across the tarmac. A troop carrier drives up, and soldiers lift bodies in body bags from the chopper and load them onto the troop carrier. Ferris walks along past an airport terminal building, talking on his phone, and Skip's by an SUV in arrivals. A soldier detonates a bomb, and Al-Saleem watches a news report with one of his men. Ferris, Hani, and Garland are also watching as Garland sends the message in Arabic. Ferris pulls out his earpiece while Al-Saleem sits on a balcony. His lieutenant walks over with a laptop, and Al-Saleem sits and opens it, which displays a picture of Sadiki. Al-Saleem looks at the picture, studies the photo, and narrows his eyes. In his office, Sadiki shows a model to three men when a colleague calls over. Sadiki goes to a computer and opens his mail, where emails flood across the screen. He frowns as he starts to read the messages, and below the message is a photograph of someone wearing a balaclava. The next has a picture of someone holding up the Koran. Sadiki looks at a TV that plays news footage of the bombing and, increasingly alarmed, takes off his glasses. Carrying a case and laptop, Sadiki rushes out of the building, walks out onto the street, and stops to look around anxiously. Then he walks over to his Mercedes, deactivating the alarm as he goes, walks round to the driver's door, unlocks it, opens it, and gets in. He frantically turns the key in the ignition, switches on the headlights as a group of men wander past watching, and drives away in his cream Mercedes.",
    "1351": "A lighter is used to ignite something that is dropped, illuminating a tunnel at the bottom of a nearly-dug hole, indicating it is too far to jump. A jeep roars past with Jack driving and Louis sitting beside him. Their interaction is awkward but not angry, revealing moments of vulnerability, fear, and sadness. Jack offers a small nod of forgiveness and gratitude, which Louis silently accepts. Joe begins climbing down a rope into the dark hole, followed by Cary, with the barn roof overhead. Cry soon joins them at the bottom, where they face three possible ways to go. As they walk into the tall oval dirt tunnel, distant sparkly light is visible. They reach an area resembling a living room, beneath another hole dug through a house. Continuing, they encounter an intersection with a new tunnel, hearing mechanical rumbling grow louder. Joe and Cary cautiously advance, confronted by something off-camera that invokes fear and amazement. They cross to the other side, where Cary bumps into a hanging Sheriff Pruitt. Joe stops Cary from screaming and leads him away, noticing tunnels illuminated by makeshift hanging bulbs. Stunned by their surroundings, Joe spots something alarming, and Cary sees a human leg among metal and machinery. They suppress the urge to scream, Joe whispering in panic. Moving for a better view, Joe discovers three hanging human bodies in a rock-wall inset, including Alice, causing his heart to pound and his resolve to strengthen, which Cary sees too. Cary opens his backpack, preparing explosives and ensuring he’s unseen by the creature. Joe, with a lit sparkler for light, races to find another entrance into the creature’s space, reaching an intersection and vanishing down the tunnel.",
    "294": "Lisa has climbed over the wall and is helping Stella down into Thorwald's yard. Jeff picks up the phone and quickly dials. The buzzer sounds on filter, then the phone is lifted. A woman's voice is heard and Jeff seems a little puzzled at the sound of it. He squints out the window. Jeff's conversation continues over the action of the two women. Apparently no sight of Thorwald. He looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back to Lisa. The shovel is lying on the ground beside Lisa. Stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk. Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape. While Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it. Lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of Thorwald's apartment. She tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. She goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases. Jeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the salesman's apartment. Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks toward Jeff's apartment and, to communicate her dismay, she turns the handbag upside down. Empty. He lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety. He mutters, almost to himself. His eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to Lisa. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them. Lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry. She finds nothing. As Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and Stella hurries into the apartment. Jeff swings toward Stella. He reaches for the phone. As he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down again. Stella looks out the window and her face registers shock. Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone for the moment. Jeff and Stella turn for a quick glimpse of the songwriter's apartment. At this moment, from the songwriter's apartment which has been quiet for a while, comes a new burst of melody. A quick flash of the songwriter's apartment, and his musical group gathered around the piano. Miss Lonely Hearts lifts her head to listen, and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water into her lap, her whole purpose arrested by the beauty of what she hears.",
    "1168": "Luna's silvery Patronus disappears as the room grows dark, causing the students to look around nervously. A huge mirror cracks and shatters, and Nigel peers through a hole in the stone wall behind it, seeing Umbridge and her squad, as she aims her wand. Harry pulls Nigel away just before the wall implodes, sending chunks of stones flying into the room in a cloud of dust, while Umbridge beams with satisfaction. Harry notices Draco holding a tearful and distressed Cho. Dumbledore winks at Harry as Fawkes the phoenix swoops down, and man and bird disappear in a burst of flame. Meanwhile, Filch climbs a high, tottering ladder to read the latest decree, removing a painting of six men in Elizabethan dress inspecting a skeleton to make more space on the wall. The men in the painting look up in alarm as Filch tips it to one side, and they all slide out of sight. The intricate locking mechanism on the school's main doors slides into place. In the great hall, the members of Dumbledore's army take their punishment, writing without ink using Umbridge's curled brown quills as she sits on the stage facing them, perched on Dumbledore's chair, dressed in a long pink robe, and drinking a cup of tea. As the students wince with pain, she smiles to herself with obvious pleasure, while Fred and George, gritting their teeth, glare at her. Outside the hall, Cho is standing as the students come out, clutching their sore and painful hands. Hesitantly, Cho approaches the last person to leave, but he cuts her dead and walks past, leaving her tearful and forlorn as she gazes after him. Elsewhere, Hagrid peers through an archway into the Forbidden Forest, where a herd of creatures, half-man, half-horse, gallops past, and a young giant looms out of the shadows, ten times bigger than Hagrid. The giant flattens a bird between his huge hands as Gwarp lumbers towards them, knocking Hagrid aside. Though they back away, Gwarp is restrained by a rope tethered to a tree, towering over them. Gwarp grabs Hermione, while Ron thwacks Gwarp and is knocked over. Hermione, looking like a tiny doll in the giant's fist, wags her finger sternly in his face, and Gwarp places her gently on the ground. Ron looks at her anxiously as Gwarp searches through a pile of scrap metal, choosing a gift for Hermione—a pair of bicycle handlebars in his colossal fist—which he offers to her. Hermione takes the handlebars, and Gwarp looks at her expectantly, with Hagrid nodding encouragement. Hermione rings the rusty bell, and Gwarp sits playing with it, smiling innocently. Meanwhile, Harry sees his parents in a mirror, with a reflection of his younger self between them as Snape points his wand, causing a confusion of happy and terrifying memories to flash through Harry's mind.",
    "307": "Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing. In the driveway, 7-year-old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica as Evan pets the dog and watches his mother work. Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt, but the carburetor will not set properly. Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. The classroom is filled with screaming, running children when Mrs. Boswell enters with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year-old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk, opens the bottom drawer, and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it; the drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies, and some of the corpses have been cut open with surprisingly anatomically correct insides. Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern, visibly shaken now. Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office where Evan busily writes in his new black-marble mead comp book. Meanwhile, Andrea speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan, hangs up, walks into the next room, grabs the pocketbook off the coffee table, and heads back into the kitchen, dropping her purse in shock when she sees Evan, in the doorway, expressionless and holding a large BUTCHER KNIFE by his side. Evan sees her but remains expressionless, seems stunned to find himself holding the knife, and drops it. Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile, who approaches the car and opens the door for Evan. Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets out, and Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air. The rec-room/basement. Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly. Panic spreads across Evan's face. Dr. Redfield leads Evan inside, where Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table, his eyes fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass; JASON, thirty and haggard-looking, enters the room as Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement.",
    "912": "Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils, and stares forward with a steely gaze. Red peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Dillinger stands below an overcast sky. Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead. His gaze drifts to a road, which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon. In a farmhouse, gang members change clothes while eating. A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table. Pete buttons up next to another escapee. Red puts out a cigarette. All of the men leave. Outside, Dillinger walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him. They hold eye contact and she lets go. As Dillinger turns and walks away from the farmhouse, the woman continues to gaze after him. A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand. Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. In the car, as Red drives, Dillinger looks back at Pete. He faces forward and glances at Red. A man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a Tommy gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him, toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill. The outlaw races downhill into an apple orchard. At the hill's crest, the clean-cut lawman stops and watches the outlaw run between two rows of trees. He aims his rifle. Floyd runs backwards, firing wildly. The lawman's shot misses. Floyd runs on. Calmly taking a knee, the lawman aims again, rubbing his finger on the trigger. Floyd sprints through the trees, almost out of his pursuer's sight. The lawman's finger engages a secondary trigger, then wraps around the main trigger. The shot blasts through Floyd's belly and he flops on the grass. The shooter gazes up from his sights, then stands and approaches the outlaw with the rest of the men following behind. As the men arrive, Floyd takes out a pistol which the lawman kicks out of his hand. He aims his rifle at the wounded outlaw, who lies on his back. Purvis' piercing stare remains fixed on the dying man. Blood gushes from Floyd's belly wound, saturating his white dress shirt. His head falls back on the grass and his convulsing throat muscles come to rest. The lawmen lower their weapons. Purvis studies the dead outlaw then nods at his men. Purvis slings his rifle strap over his shoulder. His eyes and purses his lips. The Nash sedan comes to a stop. In a clean, white kitchen, a woman standing near the sink folds a newspaper.",
    "242": "Szpilman retreats into the room with his nose bleeding, while the women watch from behind blankets and Mother hurries to him to wipe his nose. It is still quite dark as the Szpilmans and about twenty others stand lined up under lights from German vehicles. An NCO makes a selection, using his pistol to prod people, and when he reaches the Szpilmans, he selects Henryk and Halina. He then turns to shoot a young woman in the head, who falls to the ground bleeding. The partition is pulled aside, and people, including the Szpilmans, are either dressing or packing their belongings. Shots, screams, and a piercing whistle are heard on a hot summer's day. Jews, including Szpilman, Mother, Regina, and Father, clutch their belongings and walk towards wooden gates, where Jewish policemen order them into line. They shuffle through the opened gates, pausing to take in their surroundings. People walk up and down; a young man whispers to a woman who continues crying. Trucks arrive, unloading more Jews who are marched through the gates. Mothers, children, and old people, most holding papers, plead as the sun blazes. Szpilman wanders around, greeting people, while the area becomes crowded, and old people lie exhausted. Women with dehydrated children move group to group; one approaches Szpilman, who shakes his head sadly, and she wanders off. Ehrlich and Grun engage Father in conversation until Mother cries out and Regina and Szpilman call and wave to Henryk and Halina, who struggle through the crowd. Halina falls into Mother’s arms and is comforted by her while Father smiles sadly and Szpilman stares at Halina. The place becomes packed, with people calling names and women wailing. The Szpilmans sit in the same place, Henryk apart, reading a small book. Grun leans towards Halina, who looks at him in disbelief as Szpilman takes Henryk’s book to read the title. The Szpilmans remain seated on the curb.",
    "891": "Jane and Bingley stand out amongst the dancers as they move with each other easily, sharing smiles. The dancers move in intricate and formal patterns, circling their partners, then crossing to form lines. The women hold out their arms gracefully, forming delicate arcs before gliding back into their starting positions. Jane and Bingley separate, then come back together. Darcy looks at her defiantly, and whilst his back is turned, Lizzie smiles to herself and raises her eyebrows. They are interrupted by Sir William, and a look of growing concern crosses Darcy's face as once again, the dance forces them apart. Lizzie's brow furrows into a frown as she and Darcy stand opposite each other. Darcy begins to look a little agitated as he circles another dancer, while Lizzie looks a little pleased with herself as the dance draws to a close. The gentlemen and ladies bow and curtsy to each other before Darcy takes Lizzie's hand and leads her from the floor. He bows curtly and leaves, and Lizzie watches after him, frustratedly. Now, the guests are gathered in a different room. Mr. Bennet joins Mrs. Bennet at the dining table, where she's eating with relish. Jane and Lizzie stand with a happy group, including Bingley, and Lizzie smiles and leaves them, meeting Miss Bingley, who swans off, leaving Lizzie furious. Lizzie strides to a punch bowl and serves herself a cup, and a concerned Jane follows her. Mary leaps up from her chair and scurries to the piano, and Jane and Lizzie look mortified at Mary's clumsy playing. A furious Miss Bingley signals for her sister to follow her, and they brush past Lizzie and Jane, starting to maliciously whisper to each other. Darcy and Bingley look at Mary, and Mr. Bennet looks embarrassed, while only Mrs. Bennet seems to be really enjoying it. Mr. Darcy stands, towering over Mr. Collins, and then walks away, passing Lizzie and joining the Bingley sisters. Outside, dogs are reacting to Mary's singing, and inside, the Bingley sisters look at Mary with barely disguised contempt. Lizzie gives her father a desperate look, and he jumps up from his seat and joins Mary at the piano. Mary peels off her glasses and leaves the piano, head bowed, as Louisa Hurst briskly crosses the room and sits at the piano. Mr. Collins stands awkwardly at the piano, silenced by the playing, and he tries to cover up by waving his hands to the music. Lydia comes skipping and swirling into the room, holding an officer's sword above her head, and collapses in a chair while Lizzie looks mortified. Mrs. Hurst smiles smugly, and Mrs. Bennet closes the door on them, then leans in to eavesdrop before she scurries away. He holds up a hand to stop her, and she takes a seat. He looks shocked and then rises from bended knee as she hurries out.",
    "579": "Parrish is at a loss, and Susan's directness catches him by surprise, causing Joe to blink and silently feel extremely anxious about Susan's inquiries. Susan approaches Joe, who tries to respond but can't, his stammer interrupted by her. They are inches apart, surrounded by each other's scent, a heaviness in the moment, and Joe turns to head up the stairs. He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture and climbs the stairs, as Susan watches him disappear. Susan is left alone with Parrish, who is making a drink at a sidebar, and she kisses him before leaving. Elsewhere, the Board of Parrish Communications is gathered, with Parrish and Quince absent. Drew quietly speaks to Felicia and she leaves the room, only to return with Quince, who enters surprised but smiling, realizing what Drew has on his mind. Quince nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the Board. She bursts into tears again as a sense of foreboding falls over Joe's face, fearing he is passing through a point of no return, but his apprehensive expression fades away. Parrish and Joe enter, with the entire Board assembled, including Drew, Quince, and Sloane. Drew receives a message while Joe checks all attendees, his eyes resting on Drew. Parrish looks around, extending the moment, appearing as if he may never answer, and remains expressionless. Joe's eyes remain fixed on Drew as he follows Parrish out of the room. Sloane pursues Parrish and Joe, but when the elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside, leaving Sloane behind. The Board meeting breaks up, with members lingering in clusters, exchanging post-mortems. An enraged Quince corners Drew out of earshot, falls silent, and is struck dumb. Her head nestles under his arm, feeling his comfort without his awareness, and she laughs at his earnestness. Joe drifts away, lying with her but for the first time feeling separate, sensing him gone to a distant land, while she smiles. Joe and Susan are at the front door, where he helps her with her coat, they kiss, the kiss lingering. Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe, and leaves, Joe softly closing the door after her. He turns back into the foyer, looking up at Parrish on the balcony, who has observed Joe and Susan.",
    "327": "Frodo peers out from the seat as the world seems to shrink, with views of far-off lands telescoping towards him through the mist. Startled, he leaps off the seat and tumbles down the stairs while the eye sweeps Amon Hen seeking its ring, and with a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring off his finger and lies gasping on the summit below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him, then backs away, shocking Aragorn. Frodo uncurls his fist, revealing the ring, which glints gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun, drawing Aragorn’s eyes to it. Aragorn freezes and draws his sword as Frodo hesitates and backs away into the trees. Suddenly, 200 Uruk-hai swarm onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn, who attacks them like a madman, bringing two down with his sword and leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. Sam looks around for Frodo while Aragorn battles the Uruk-hai amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. Lurtz orders his forces as Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight, darting down the steep hillside with heavy feet thundering behind him. Elven arrows smash into the Uruk-hai as Legolas races out of the woods firing his bow and Gimli leaps into battle wielding his mighty axe. Frodo stumbles and falls, quickly crawling behind a tree while the sound of Uruk-hai crashing through the forest rings out. He turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow nearby, looking at his friends with a great sadness in his eyes as Merry's eyes meet his with understanding. Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo, but Merry grabs his arm. Meanwhile, Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling Uruk-hai in his path while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action. Many Uruk-hai fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin, but Lurtz takes aim and a black arrow thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow and then another bring him to his knees as Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by Uruk-hai. Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze, and Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand, his fingers tightening around the hilt. Frodo looks to the far side of the river as the camera moves in on the ring, tears falling down his face, and with renewed determination, he tucks the ring inside his vest pocket and pushes the Elvish boat into the water. Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake where Frodo is already paddling away. Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing, while Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat.",
    "214": "The hobos stare as Everett gives an ingratiating smile while the second convict begins to haul himself into the boxcar and the third convict keeps pace outside. The convict running outside stumbles and disappears, and the middle convict is yanked out immediately after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward, smashes his chin onto the floor, and is sucked out the open doorway, his fingernails leaving grooves on the boxcar floorboards. The hobos impassively watch as the three men tumble down the track embankment, clanking. They come to a rest in swampland at the bottom, then shake their heads clear, rise to their feet in the muck, and watch the train recede, leaving only the baying of hounds. Everett looks desperately about, and the two other men look interrogatively to Delmar, who looks from Pete to Everett and nods agreeably. Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture, and all listen. The men turn in unison to look up the track at a small, distant form moving toward them, which resolves into a human-propelled flatcar as it draws closer. An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw handle. The three convicts watch the swampland, which begins to show movement as men and dogs trample the grass. The flatcar draws even and slows, and the three men clamber aboard as the old man resumes pumping. The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the blind prophet while the cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the track with the seesaw handle rising and falling. The old man pumps rhythmically, and all contemplate his words. Suddenly, a rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men. The front of the farmhouse shows a harshly shaded porch and a dark screen door, which swings open as a child holding a gun emerges and steps into the sunlight; the child is about eight years old with grimy face and tattered overalls. He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands. Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted bathtub amidst a yard of ancient car parts and farm implements overgrown with weeds, artlessly whittling a stick. He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, then returns to his whittling. The four men and the little boy sit around the kitchen table eating stew, with a Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair bringing him to table height. Wash glances at the little boy as the three men slurp their stew, while he sniffs dubiously at his spoon.",
    "395": "As they pass Jude, she smiles, and outside the restaurant, Fergus marches Dil away. They pass out of shot, and in the background, Jude rises. Dil and Fergus make their way to their seats at the bar, where a figure is sitting down. She leaves, and Dil watches her go. She looks at Col, and there are tears in her eyes. She stands and staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there, with an expression in Col's eyes making Fergus feel very small. Fergus rises and walks out, looking toward where Jude is waiting. Jude grabs his arm and draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting, and they get inside. Dil, sitting inside a taxi, watches Fergus and Jude getting in the car. Jude is driving, with Maguire next to her, and Fergus sits in the back. Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand and hits him on the teeth with his fist. Jude drives, and the car halts in a sedate square. Several doors down is an entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club. In the car, Maguire turns off the engine, nodding toward the building and a Daimler parked away. Fergus looks from the window to the car, and Jude turns to look at him. Jude and Fergus get out of the car and walk down the street to a cafe-bar with tables outside, across from the brothel-cum-club. Fergus and Jude cross the street and take their seats by the tables, with the brothel visible down the way. She checks her watch, and Fergus is sweating. Down by the brothel, the door swings open, and Fergus walks down toward it. An old, portly gent in a suit emerges, and the car by the pavement activates and its door opens. Fergus quickens his pace, with Jude watching from the cafe. Fergus reaches the car before the gent does and passes between him and the open door, brushing the gent's stomach with his elbow. Fergus walks on as the old man is eased inside the Daimler, which then pulls off. After it passes Fergus, he turns around and walks back. Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches, then begins to walk away, as Fergus turns to see Dil in front of the cafe.",
    "951": "Joe looks taken aback, but pleasantly so, as a girl, Tina, sits up nearby. They carefully lower the sheriff, who is up on his feet, and Joe, Alice, and Tina follow him through the alien's maze of equipment. The sheriff shines his flashlight ahead, and Cary rounds the corner while being pursued by an alien in a dark tunnel. The alien suddenly stops in its tracks and grabs the sheriff. The others flee, but Tina, bringing up the rear, is snatched by the creature and pulled back into the darkness. The alien comes after Joe and the others, who run down a dark tunnel until they reach a dead end and are forced to stop. The alien emerges from the shadows, and while Alice and Cary cower back, Joe stands his ground as it draws closer. The alien draws itself up to its full height of about 25 feet, and Joe steps towards it. The alien cocks its head and picks Joe up, holding him close to its face to get a look at him. It has a skull-like face with huge mandibles, and its breath ruffles Joe's hair as it breathes on him. The alien leans in close, retracts some protective membranes from over its eyes, and its expression softens. It looks away momentarily upon hearing the machinery, then turns back to Joe. Alice watches warily as the alien puts Joe back on the ground and turns to run away up the tunnel on its many legs, leaving Joe to stare after it, catching his breath. Back on the surface, Joe, Alice, and Cary join troops on a street in town, where a strange magnetic force pulls metal items up off the ground towards the water tower. A bin, oil barrels, a table lamp, a bicycle, and other objects are drawn irresistibly to the tower and stick to its side. A shop window bursts open and television sets are sucked into the air, and a soldier is lifted about 20 feet into the air by his rifle before letting go. A car rises out of the used car lot, and a military container lorry bursts open to release white cubes that flood out. Joe, Alice, and Cary dive to the ground as cubes pass overhead, and these cubes, along with cars and other items, begin to fuse together, forming a gigantic structure on top of the tower.",
    "363": "Gandalf watches as the beacons burst into flames, his eyes flashing briefly with triumph before he hurries off. The beacon glows brightly on the slopes of Mount Mindolluin, high above Minas Tirith. Pulling back, Gandalf hurries to the battlement, looking further west along the White Mountains. Denethor stares at the beacon from the citadel window with a look of black fury on his face. Gandalf has a strange smile playing on his face. In an aerial shot, moving over the White Mountains, the trail of great fires winds slowly from peak to peak. On a rocky peak high above Edoras, a great beacon fire is ignited. A bell tolls urgently, and Aragorn looks tensely out across the mountains. Pulling back, Aragorn runs towards the Golden Hall and bursts in. Theoden looks up, startled, as Eowyn and Eomer turn to look at their uncle. Tension builds as Theoden lowers his head and then slowly raises it to look Aragorn in the eye. At the Edoras lookout, a soldier rings the great bell in alarm as below, in the courtyard, soldiers mount their steeds amid great activity. Theoden strides purposefully outside, flanked by Eomer and his soldiers, moving onto the parapets to watch as the soldiers prepare. Eowyn hurriedly pulls on riding gloves and prepares to mount her horse, turning to run smack into Aragorn. Aragorn smiles, reaching past her to lift a cover revealing a sword strapped to the side of her saddle. Eowyn deftly pulls the cover back down and looks at Aragorn. Pulling back, Theoden stares around at the streets and people of Edoras, as if he knows he will not see this place again. Eomer, astride his horse, calls to the assembled. Theoden, astride Snowmane, rides out with Eomer, Aragorn, Merry, Legolas, Gimli, and a great column of Rohirrim, thundering towards Dunharrow in the mountains. Meanwhile, Faramir and his men are fighting a losing battle against the Mordor invasion. Ominous sounds of wind rising fill the air, followed by a sudden terrifying shriek. Soldiers retreat through the ruins of the city as the Nazgul swoop down high in the sky. Madril is cut down by an Orc, his breathing quick and shallow. Gothmog, with hideously deformed features, stands over the prone figure of the injured ranger. He grabs a spear from a nearby underling and drives the shaft into Madril's chest, then surveys the carnage with satisfaction. Faramir and a few survivors flee West Osgiliath, desperately riding toward Minas Tirith as dark shapes pursue them in the sky. Suddenly, from on high, the Nazgul strike, tilting down as they swoop out of low-lying murky clouds, tossing men in the air like limp ragdolls. At that moment, across the plain, a figure clothed in white rides towards them. From the battlements of Minas Tirith, a call is made.",
    "1231": "Ben gets out of his car and admires a shiny BMW convertible parked beside him, then walks past elderly ladies, one using a Zimmer frame, who shuffle down a corridor. Ben strides towards the reception window, shows IRS ID, and passes a suited man sitting on the edge of Inez's bed. Inez reaches for a pad, but the man grabs her wrist, then notices Ben, causing her to shun his touch and ignore him. The man approaches Ben, looking awkward and leaning forward, while Ben stares impassively. Ben nods, cocks his head as he continues staring, straightens up, smiles faintly, picks up his briefcase, and disdainfully shakes the man's hand. Ben enters Inez's room where she lies frail and white-haired in bed, ignoring him with a sigh. Ben gives a kindly smile, but Inez stares ahead, stony-faced. Ben places his briefcase on the floor, gingerly moves a chair towards her bed, and sits at her bedside. Despite Inez's vacant stare, Ben gently smiles as she turns her head to look at him. With heavily lined features, Inez stares pensively at Ben, turns stiffly, and reaches out a bony hand to pick up her writing pad and pen. Inez studies Ben again, then writes something down, pauses, writes more, and looks at Ben wearily with her lip quivering. She weeps, looks tearful at Ben's encouraging smile, and writes again. As Ben reads, his brow furrows and he looks dismayed while Inez's face crumples, and she weeps. Feeling deeply moved, Ben raises his clasped hands to his mouth, hurriedly carries Inez out, puts her in a wheelchair, and wheels her past reception. Confronting Goodman, Ben pushes his head against a window and marches out. On a sunny golf course, a woman in a short skirt and T-shirt, and a guy in chinos and a polo shirt, get out of a golf buggy and walk to a ball. Ben approaches them, hugs them, but then Michelle moves away, and Ben looks the man in the eye and shakes his head. A network of freeway flyovers appears in the sunshine as Ben drives his saloon. In a hospital canteen, an elderly patient with a drip stand walks while most tables, decorated with vases of yellow flowers, are occupied. Sitting at a table, Ben reads, then looks up from his book to watch a woman with two young boys drawing at a nearby table.",
    "1223": "A bright white light shines out from the center of a black screen. The screen lightens to reveal clouds and a blue sky. The light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her. She stands on a raised plinth before the cloudy sky. An orange disc surrounded by black revolves like a record on a turntable. Shafts of light gradually form the shape of a running man. The figure becomes smaller and is frozen in the iris of an intensely blue eye. The image fades to black. A handsome black guy holds a receiver to his ear. He covers his eyes with his hand. He rocks back and forth. He removes his hand from his face. The silhouette of the man swims the crawl on the surface. Sun glints on the surface of the water. The man swims to shore and strides onto the beach. The man, tall, lean and in his 30s, walks up steps from the beach which cut through a garden, abundant with colorful flowers and bushes. A long low beach house with white flowers trailing from part of its roof looks out over a patio, the garden and the ocean. In the house, the man studies himself solemnly in a mirror as he fastens his tie. The man sits pensively on his sofa. Before him on a coffee table is a list of names with a typed note attached to it. The name Ezra Turner has been encircled on the list. In a call center cubicle, a man wearing a headset sits at a computer. Ezra types on a braille keyboard. Ezra disconnects the call. Ben slams the phone down. Looking disturbed by his own actions, Ben claps his hands to his mouth and stares down. He blinks, composes himself, and lowers his hands. Pacing, Ben stabs the air with a finger each time he calls out a name. Ben smashes a chair against a coffee table. A list of names scrolls. A rapid montage of items -- a newspaper article, a coast road, snapshots of Ben, Sarah Jenson's funeral card. A deserted open plan office in shadowy light. A cleaner polishes a floor in a brightly lit corridor. Ben sits in a cubicle, typing on a keyboard. He stares at his computer monitor gravely. The name, Emily Posa, has been encircled on his list beside him. Above it, the name Yvonne Bastidos has been crossed out. Ben stares pensively at the details, which include a photo of attractive, dark-haired Emily. He prints out her details. Traffic glides along a sunny freeway. Ben stares ahead gravely as he drives. On the seat beside him is a file with Emily Posa's details attached to it.",
    "1001": "A secret door opens, and they walk through the sliding door which has the barber's price list on it. Wolfsheim leads Gatsby and Nick into a busy speakeasy with arched ceilings, where girls in tasseled bikinis and feather headdresses dance on a stage and a line of barmen flamboyantly makes cocktails. A cop throws a man out, as Gatsby walks through, shaking hands with people. Wolfsheim, Nick, and Gatsby sit at a table facing the dancers, with Gatsby and Wolfsheim studying Nick, who sits between them, looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange pointed looks, and Gatsby goes, leaning closer, as Wolfsheim's tie pin is a jeweled tooth. They look up at Gatsby as Wolfsheim swaggers away. Unnerved, Gatsby paints on a smile while Nick looks around, seeing the city aglow with neon lights. Nick then goes to meet Jordan at a rooftop restaurant, where he frowns, recalling in a flashback Jordan practicing golf on Daisy's lawn and Gatsby leading a charge in battle. Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm along a busy city street, get a cab, and ride in it while a bright moon hangs in the night sky and the cab drives along the tree-lined lane. Gatsby stands amongst the trees near Nick's cottage, looking up the lane, and Nick sees Gatsby and frowns as the cab rolls up. Nick gets out, the cab drives off, and Gatsby stands bathed in light. Nick looks over at Gatsby and gestures towards the mansion, and they both smile slightly awkwardly and look down. Gatsby gives a sharp nod and turns to go, then turns back, looking around edgily as Nick smiles openly. Gatsby nods, looks slightly at a loss, then turns and walks away while Nick looks curious. The next scene is set on a bright sunny morning when a stone birdbath is cleaned up and surrounded with pretty flowers. Nick comes out of his cottage in his dressing gown to find Gatsby's gardeners at work sprucing up the garden. A path of paving slabs is laid, hedges are trimmed, and flowers are arranged in beds as Nick looks up at a man trimming a rose arch and steps under it, reaching out his hand. It's pouring with rain when Gatsby, wearing a white suit, walks up with a line of staff all holding up umbrellas. Now dressed, Nick watches from a window as staff members carry flower arrangements, including one very fancy four-tiered pink cake. Nick has a tray of little cupcakes, as Gatsby steps up and the staff go into the cottage, with the flowers carried in behind them. Gatsby looks tense, frowns, and goes inside, leaving Nick holding his tray of little cakes. Inside, a clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four as Nick sits, dwarfed by extravagant flower arrangements, with a cake stand full of cakes and a big pile of brightly colored macaroons nearby.",
    "690": "A burst of light reveals a woman dressed in a white classical robe with a blue still draped over her arm standing on top of a shallow pyramid of steps holding a blazing torch high in her right hand, followed by pages from a superhero comic book flickering rapidly down the screen. A spinning war vortex of blue light becomes a silver blue spider's web which scatters the words of the opening credits, as more splintered images reveal earlier moments in the story, including a spider biting Peter Parker, Peter's look of disbelief at his changing physique in a mirror watched by Uncle Ben and Aunt May, and Peter having fun with red-headed Mary Jane and crawling up a wall like a spider. Uncle Ben's wise, kindly face appears, and Spider-Man in his skintight red and blue webbed suit swings lively from thread to thread like a trapeze artist. More credits appear and blow away as if made of sand, while a tangle of sinister black, sticky tendrils crawl across everything in their path. On a street, Peter Parker rips open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man suit beneath, and Mary Jane in a long white dress looks reproachfully at Peter in the final fractured image. The broken mirror pieces slot together, becoming the blue sky above New York City, as Spider-Man swings through the air, high above the city streets. Peter rides his small moped, while a student aims a peashooter at Peter's neck and another shines a light in Peter's face. Peter steps up to the ticket window and makes his way to his seat. As he sits down in the center of the front row, a couple of large men sit on either side of him. The lights go down, and the curtains open, revealing a starry backdrop as Mary Jane descends a staircase wearing a glamorous, long, white dress. Peter grins proudly and mouths the lyrics, while in a balcony seat to the side of the auditorium, dark-haired Harry Osborne is watching Mary Jane through opera glasses. He lowers the glasses, then his gaze settles on Peter sitting below him in the stalls. Peter, lost in Mary Jane's performance, is totally unaware of Harry's malevolent stare. Following a couple of young women out of the theater, Peter grins with pleasure as he spots someone up ahead. Harry slowly turns to face him, then gets into the back of his chauffeur-driven limo and is driven away, leaving Peter standing helplessly on the pavement. The scene shifts to Mary Jane's dressing room, where Mary Jane smiles warmly and Peter beams happily. In the Goblin Lair at the Osborne mansion, several incarnations of the demonic Green Goblin mask are displayed on stands along with a number of high-tech weapons and futuristic flying equipment.",
    "305": "Joe is behind his desk and looks at Vic, who swallows some Remy. Joe walks back around to his desk and sits in his chair. Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie, who bobs his head up and down, while Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous, talking on his portable car phone. Mr. White, Mr. Pink, and Mr. Blonde surround a cop and proceed to beat him. The three men are disheveled, hair a mess, and shirttails out, as they have the cop tied to a chair and continue wailing on him. Eddie steps inside the warehouse, and when Nice Guy Eddie walks in, everybody jumps. Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange, and Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde. Eddie, Mr. White, and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse, talking amongst themselves. Mr. Blonde then slowly turns his head towards the cop, walks toward him, and slaps his face. He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth as the cop moves around wildly. Freddy finishes pretending to be unconscious, walks past the sheriffs to the sink, and looks down to watch Freddy washing his hands. Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop, opens a razor, turns on the radio, and sings along with Stealer's Wheel. He stares into the cop’s face, holding the razor and singing along, before lashing out like a cobra with a slash across the face, then cuts off the cop’s ear and holds it up for him to see. Mr. Blonde walks out of the warehouse, opens the trunk, and pulls out a large can of gasoline. He returns inside, pours gasoline all over the cop, who begs him not to, and lights a match. Mr. Orange, who was shot, looks at the kid's gashed face and the hole where his ear used to be, as Marvin starts to weep. We see Mr. Orange, known as Freddy Newendyke, wearing a high school letterman jacket, enter a coffee shop, spot Holdaway, and head his way, sliding into the booth with him. Holdaway listens to Freddy, looks at him for a moment, then smiles. Freddy paces back and forth, rehearsing an anecdote, reading from the page and sometimes stumbling over his words.",
    "598": "Dumbledore glances down and catches Harry's eye. Snape looks eyes with Dumbledore, Bellatrix glares. Dumbledore's eyes flicker. Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore is flung backwards over the balustrade. The white-haired professor seems to float gently downwards. Snape grabs the distraught Draco. Bellatrix is jubilant. The shape of a skull appears in the dark clouds. Snape rushes Draco down the tower's spiral staircase. Harry follows, as Snape leads the death eaters and the ashen-faced Draco through the school corridors. Bellatrix creates havoc as she strides along a tabletop in the Great Hall. An Auror is thrown aside. Bellatrix aims her wand at the huge windows. They explode and the candles are snuffed out. Draco, Snape, and the Death Eaters stride through the forest towards Hagrid's cottage. Harry follows. Bellatrix sets fire to the cottage. Harry aims his wand. Harry falls. Bellatrix licks her lips then saunters away. Illuminated by the flames from the burning cottage, Snape stands alone. Harry lies on his back on the hillside. Snape turns away as Harry gets to his feet. Harry staggers forward. Snape deflects the spell. Harry crashes to the ground. Snape walks over to him. Trembling, Harry looks up at Snape, who kicks Harry's wand from his hand. Harry lies motionless on the grassy hillside. Snape hurries away past the burning cottage below him. Harry looks up at the glowering clouds forming the shape of a skull. Harry strides through the school courtyard followed by Hagrid. He pushes past students and teachers. Professor McGonagall, Hermione, Ginny, and Ron stand at the front of the crowd. Harry kneels beside Dumbledore's body. He leans forward and gently touches Dumbledore's cheek. The Horcrux. Harry gently places his hand on Dumbledore's heart. Ginny walks forward and kneels down beside Harry. He rests his head on her shoulder. A tear rolls down Hermione's cheek. Professor McGonagall raises her wand high above her head. The tip of it glows as it points up towards the skull-shaped cloud. Pomfrey raises her wand then Luna. One after another, everyone does the same. Wand after wand points upwards, the tip of each one glowing like a star. Grief-stricken, the staff and students stand in solemn silence. Dumbledore lies before them, his face serene and peaceful. As the wands glow more brightly, light bursts through the clouds and the skull disappears. Harry takes his hand from Dumbledore's heart. His head on Ginny's shoulder, Harry weeps. Sunlight streams in through the damaged window of the Great Hall. The long tables are bare, the seats and benches are empty. The door of Dumbledore's study opens and Harry steps inside. It, too, is bathed in sunlight. Harry walks towards Dumbledore's desk. A pair of half-moon spectacles lies on an open book.",
    "1005": "Gatsby stops and turns back, and Nick smiles. Gatsby walks between stone pillars off into the dark grounds and amongst the dark trees dotted with fireflies, finding Daisy standing by a tree near Nick's cottage. In a dark dinner suit and bow tie, Gatsby slowly approaches her, and they gaze into each other's eyes. He cups his hand against her cheek, leans closer, and kisses her passionately on the lips. He wraps his arm around her waist, pulls her close, and kisses her neck. Her eyes closed, Daisy tilts her head back, enraptured. Drink in hand, Nick stands on the terrace looking out into the darkness. Looking slightly disheveled, Tom walks up behind him, causing Nick to turn to Tom and frown. Tom smooths his hair back and turns to the barman. Gatsby continues to cover Daisy in kisses and pauses, lifting his head with a slight smile, meeting Daisy's gaze. Nick points his cottage out to Tom, who looks towards the cottage. Gatsby touches Daisy's face and steps away from her. Slagle and his associates are fighting with the staff. Tom puts down his glass, and Nick lifts his. Daisy turns to see Nick walk through the trees as Gatsby goes to Herzog. Daisy watches pensively as Gatsby goes with Herzog. The party winds down, and Wolfsheim paces in front of Gatsby in his study. Tom and Daisy are driven away from the mansion, and Gatsby watches from a window as they are driven away. Standing at the window, Gatsby looks thoughtful as four of his men march Slagle out through the gates, with one of them laying into Slagle with heavy punches to the face. Inside, the staff clear up as Gatsby stands on the terrace looking out across the bay while his staff busy themselves clearing up the mess. The green light on the dock at Tom Buchanan's mansion gently pulses. Nick comes down some steps, tossing a bottle in the pool. Gatsby grabs his suit jacket, clenches his eyes shut, and pinches the bridge of his nose. In the flashback, Gatsby follows Daisy to an upstairs room where they stand close to each other about to kiss, then Gatsby moves back. A shooting star flies across the night sky as they stand transfixed by each other. Gatsby leans closer, kisses Daisy, and they sink into a passionate embrace, lying together. He kisses her soft white skin, and they lie in each other's arms. Daisy's grand house stands alone lit up at night until the light fades. He points up as a star shoots by and tosses something into the illuminated pool. They both smile wistfully. Gatsby looks across the dark bay, smiles confidently, and steps over to Nick, who looks down, frowning.",
    "572": "The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown, and from inside, throaty wails of frustration can be heard. Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against Edgar's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. He bellows in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally cracks a hinge. Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless, but the rest of the box is empty. He points up at the screen with a laser pencil, indicating the three stars that make up the belt. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars will be out tonight. It's more than Kay can bear, so he reaches out and flicks a switch, clicking off the picture of her. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen. Jay drags a chair and sits down, and together Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so aliens who live on Earth are represented by a flickering light. Some lights are starting to go out. Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen, before Kay and Jay walk away. Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve-gauge shotgun, pointing it at the tow truck driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun. There are several photos of a cat on the wall and a pile of bejeweled cat collars. Jay's attention is broken by something through the window, where outside, lumbering straight for the store, is Edgar. Jay fires, shattering the storefront window and blowing up a car on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, slamming him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up, leaping through the broken storefront window and after Edgar. Kay gestures to a group of onlookers, drawn by the curious blasts from the store, with smoking rubble everywhere. After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone. Zed is in his office, looking down to the vast floor below where he sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor, then looks up at the screen. Edgar gets out and walks away fast, cursing under his breath, ranting and livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the news vendor by the collar.",
    "1181": "Harry looks on in amazement as the boy lines up his trolley and disappears through the wall followed by his identical twin brother. The little girl smiles at him while Harry looks at the solid brick wall. He aims his trolley, takes a deep breath, runs straight at the wall, and finds himself safely on the other side, where he pushes his trolley on to Platform 9 and three-quarters. Harry smiles with delight beside the platform, where a handsome steam engine stands. The train steams through the countryside, and Harry has a carriage to himself. He sits by the window looking out at the passing scenery. A red-haired boy has a smudge of dirt on his nose, and Ron's eyes widen. Harry pushes back his hair as Ron holds up a bag of squashed sandwiches. Harry pulls out a handful of gold coins, and the boys share the sweets. Harry pulls a face as he takes a bean out of his mouth then opens a box marked chocolate frog. The frog jumps and leaps through the open window. Harry sees a hologram on the card and looks again. A rat appears, and Ron takes out a wand. A girl at the door pulls a wand out of her cloak and points it at Harry, mending his broken spectacles. Harry glances at Ron as Hermione looks disapprovingly at Ron on her way out, and he rubs his nose. The train draws into a small country station where Hagrid is waiting on the platform, holding a powerful lamp. Wearing black cloaks over their school uniforms, the pupils are dwarfed by the giant Hagrid, and Ron gazes up at him in amazement. Hagrid leads the way to the shores of a mysterious pitch-black lake, where four at a time, the children crawl into small, wooden boats, each softly lit by lamps suspended by a pole. The boats start to move, and half hidden by clouds, the moon casts a faint blue light. Mist rises from the water as the tiny wooden boats drift silently across the lake. In the distance, the children see the turrets and towers of a vast castle perched high on the other side. Light sparkles from hundreds of windows, and the children gaze in wonder at the huge imposing building. It towers above them as the fleet of little boats glides closer to the cliff on which it stands. Safely disembarked, the crowd of new students follow each other into the castle and up a wide marble staircase. On the upper landing, long, thin fingers tap the stone balustrade patiently. Standing in front of huge oak doors, the tall figure of Professor McGonagall faces the first-years as they reach the top of the stairs. Neville Longbottom picks up his lost brown toad and looks up at Professor McGonagall nervously.",
    "193": "Uncle Billy picks it up. Potter is seated behind his desk, with his goon alongside him. Standing in front of the desk is a distinguished-looking man, obviously the president of the bank, mopping his brow with his handkerchief. George bangs the receiver down and turns to meet Uncle Billy's anxious look. He realizes George has hung up and clicks the phone furiously. An ominous sound of angry voices comes from the other room. George and Uncle Billy exit from George's office, and more people have crowded around the counter. Their muttering stops, and they stand silent and grim, with panic on their faces. As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street below. The crowd turns to the windows, then back to George. Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene, with Mary watching silently. A man named Randall comes in and makes his way up to Tom. Randall starts out, and a few other people start for the door. The camera pans with George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. During this scene, Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out. George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom and speaks to Ed, the next in line. Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. George, Uncle Billy, and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the door. Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door and scurries around the counter to join the others. Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle. The four of them parade through the office; George puts the two dollars in the safe. George rushes into his office to look out the window. George hurries into the scene. An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by the weather, once had class but has not been lived in for years. This is the house that George and Mary will live in from now on. The rain is pouring down, and a faint glow of light shines out from the bottom windows. He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps. Bert and a man are working in the rain, sorting through travel posters.",
    "340": "The ominously muffled thud of their horses' hooves on the dank fir needles sets the scene as they arrive at the root of the mountain, where a sheer wall of rock towers before them. Within this wall, a creepy dark door gapes like a mouth of night, with signs and figures carved above its wide arch. At that moment, a chill wind rushes out of the doorway. Aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly, as the horses rear and buck in terror, turning until the three horses disappear. Aragorn turns resolutely towards the doorway and walks into the blackness, quickly followed by Legolas. Gimli is left alone, hesitating and struggling with his fear, before he plunges into the tunnel behind the others. Meanwhile, there is much activity as the entire camp is on the move; fires are doused, tents are pulled down, and horses are saddled. Theoden strides through the camp, Eomer at his side, preparing a little pony with a saddle and supplies. He wears an oversized helmet and Rohirrim clothing, appearing both nervous and excited. King Theoden breaks away from a column and rides up to Merry before wheeling his horse away, leaving Merry bitterly disappointed. Merry stands, head down, as a tiny dejected figure among the mighty Rohirrim on their large horses. Suddenly, Merry is plucked off the ground by a soldier who has snatched him by the collar. Merry twists around to see the soldier, and beneath a helmet and mail hood is Eowyn, disguised as a man. Merry's face is visible under the cape, looking on as the valley floor fills with thousands of horsemen who ride out after their king. Great siege towers and catapults roll across the Pelennor Fields, with thousands of flaming torches lighting the snarling, slathering Morgul Orcs marching in ragged torrents past cave trolls, who beat the drums of war. In the distance, Minas Tirith lies ahead. Aragorn leads Legolas and Gimli into a wide cavern, waving his torch through the darkness and illuminating a huge cavern. A ghastly cracking noise, like stone being sundered, cuts through the silence as a ghostly figure steps from the rock walls. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli look on in horror as a mummified spectre looms before them, eyeless sockets gazing out—it's the King of the Dead. Fog swirls around as the ghost snarls at Aragorn, who moves forward. The fog suddenly rolls back, forming a retreating wall of grey vapour, and reveals rank upon rank of spectral warriors with ghoulish faces. The fog unveils a dead army of many thousands assembled around the cavern. Aragorn stares grimly at the King of the Dead, holding his gaze as the King of the Dead moves relentlessly towards him. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli are now surrounded by an army of the dead.",
    "663": "He folds them up and lays them down. He does a double take on seeing his physique in the mirror and flexes his muscles. He turns away from admiring his new body in the mirror and reaches for his shirt. Glancing through the window, he catches sight of Mary Jane, MJ, in her room in the house next door. He smiles as she primps her hair and walks back to his mirror, grinning. Coming downstairs, he places one hand on the molding, walks on the wall around the corner, and then leaps to the ground. Peter heads out and stands, staring after having witnessed the altercation between MJ and her father. He sets off down the street after the pretty young redhead who is wearing Calfland's boots, a short skirt, and a zipped cardigan. MJ marches down the sidewalk, arms folded, reaches the school bus stop, and grinds the sole of her left boot on the ground. Peter is a bit behind. MJ climbs into her friend's Ford Mustang Convertible. The school bus beats past, now chased by Peter. He makes a grab for the bus and catches hold of a poster stuck to its side. It comes away in his hand and rips its full length. The bus zooms on, leaving Peter in the middle of the street with a large portion of the poster sticking to his fingers. He looks at his hand and ponders. The imposing Osborne home is shown as Harry rushes into the study where his father is lying face down on the floor. He helps his father to a seat, leading to a flashback where Norman stares in shock. Later, Peter is having lunch at school. He looks up from his French fries and sees MJ walking towards him with a tray of food. He smiles at her, but her smile is for the people behind him. As she passes, she slips on a spilled drink. Peter leaps to his feet, catches her, then the tray, and then the food, grinning inanely. Raising her eyebrows, MJ tries to coax an answer from him, but then she walks off. Peter gawps at her retreating figure, sits back down at the table, and lets out a big sigh. He raises his right hand, a fork is sticking to his palm, and he can't shake it off, so he pulls the fork. It's attached to web-like threads coming from his wrist, and it snaps. But another web shoots across to the next table and snares a tray. Peter holds it towards him, ducks as it flies over his head, and lands on the back of Flash Thompson, who is with MJ. Covered in mush, Flash turns around as Peter makes a quick exit, tracking the tray behind him.",
    "73": "JAY deals with a customer as SILENT BOB looks on, and the two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons and rubs his forehead, then spins angrily before his expression softens. DANTE hops behind the counter as a customer pays for something while he continues to talk. Another customer and then yet another approach the counter. JAY and SILENT BOB lean against the wall as a woman kisses DANTE's forehead and walks away, heading toward the back. DANTE watches her leave, then looks ahead dreamily, half-spinning in his chair before exploding in jubilance. RANDAL enters carrying videos, and DANTE hands him the summons, which RANDAL reads. The cooler door is heard opening as DANTE and RANDAL regard a woman curiously; she looks very satisfied. CAITLIN walks lazily down the convenience store aisle, and DANTE is bewildered as she joins them, latching onto DANTE's arm lovingly. RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused, and everyone is silent. The same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom is now serene, almost happy, as he lies on a stretcher. The body bag zipper is pulled closed as DANTE, the CORONER, and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. Midway down the body bag, something protrudes, pushing it up, indicating an erection. The CORONER takes notes while RANDAL stares at it. Ambulance attendants join them, and the stretcher is wheeled out. The CORONER stares at DANTE, while RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief. RANDAL looks down, anonymously, and DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor, both saying nothing. RANDAL hops off the freezer case and exits, later returning as DANTE crosses out of the scene. DANTE repairs ripped dollar bills by taping them back together. JAY enters with SILENT BOB and claps his hands, then exits, leaving SILENT BOB standing there until he also leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger in deep concentration, then suddenly snaps his eyes open. RANDAL has a heart-to-heart with VERONICA, who stares dumbfounded before exiting. DANTE lies alone on the floor as RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him. Close-up on RANDAL's face as he steps inside, hands clasp around his throat, and DANTE yanks him out of the frame, throttling RANDAL and choking him to the ground. RANDAL throws his fists into DANTE's midriff, sending him back into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE comes at him again, causing RANDAL to tumble into cakes as Entenmann's products scatter around him. He grabs a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and smacks it into DANTE's face as DANTE rushes him blindly.",
    "1164": "Harry kicks his trunk, leaving Ron taken aback before Ron departs, leaving Harry alone. Harry sits on his bed, staring into space and twisting and flexing his neck. He lies in a black tiled corridor with a blue door at the end, tossing and turning in his sleep as veins twist under his skin. The image of the black corridor and the blue door reappears, followed by a glass sphere and a bony hand. Harry wakes drenched with sweat, noticing Ron watching him with concern. In a classroom, a girl launches a white paper airplane that transforms into an intricate paper bird that flutters its wings. Seamus attempts to swipe at it, but the bird flies out of reach, soaring around the classroom as Crabbe aims his catapult. The bird hovers before bursting into flames as Professor Umbridge lowers her wand, points it, and causes books to distribute themselves on the students' desks with a sickly smile. Students nervously lower their eyes, and Umbridge searches for words while glancing around the classroom and slowly walking towards Harry. Inside her pink office, Umbridge puts three spoonfuls of pale pink sugar into a china cup decorated with pink roses while cats move on the china plates on the wall and she stirs her tea. Umbridge puts down the cup, touches a pen on her desk, and places a curled brown quill in front of Harry as he enters, noticing the plates on the wall and a white cat staring at him. She looks out the window and smiles with secret anticipation as Harry writes with the quill in his right hand, surprised to see the words appear on the paper in red. Umbridge smiles as Harry winces in pain as angry red arcs appear on the back of his left hand and words are cut into his skin. Harry looks at the quill in disbelief while Umbridge stands in front of him, smiling sweetly with raised eyebrows. Harry boldly meets her gaze, blinks, as she leans over him with satisfaction. Meanwhile, Fred and George try out their inventions as Ron and Hermione sit beside Harry, who turns a page of his book, shows his right hand, and Hermione looks at the scars. Harry walks off, leaving Hermione and Ron looking bewildered as his owl, Hedwig, flies away from Hogwarts. Harry stands outside Hagrid's deserted cottage, spots a large winged creature swooping into the Forbidden Forest, and wanders alone until he sees a group of horse-like creatures pulling a carriage with huge bat-like wings. A girl is stroking the nose of one of them.",
    "520": "He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the bedroom area. She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick takes off his glasses. He turns and looks at Lee in surprise. He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed. She sighs. Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest. Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled. Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the counter. Frederick cringes, reacting. He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs. Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway. Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He pounds his fist against a cupboard. Lee, gasping, moves away. He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee. He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen. Frederick turns away from Lee. He begins to pace near the counter. He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow. Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees. She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses. Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room. Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway. Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch. Elliot jumps. The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft. She talks softly into the telephone. Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver. Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance. Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths. He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk. Passersby, some holding books, are seen. A male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate. Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water. Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline.",
    "1092": "Tuvia throws out some wire across the track as a German motorbike comes into view. The brothers watch it plow into the wire and swarm towards the German soldier sprawled on the ground. They relieve the dead man of his weapon and rifle through his saddlebags. A car's headlights appear in the distance, and Zus and the others pick up the body, carry it to the side of the road, and toss it down into the wood. They take up their positions and watch the car draw nearer. The driver gets out of the open-topped car to investigate the obstacle in the road, peers to the side of the road near where Zus and the others are hiding. The two Germans in the car and their female companion light up. The driver opens his fly and takes a leak all over Zus, who tries to protect his face with his hands. The driver spots him, and Zus stabs him. The other Germans are ambushed from behind as the sergeant shoots blindly into the darkness. Asael and others chase after a private while Zus unleashes machine gun fire. Asael chases after the fleeing private and brings him down. Zus finishes up the Germans in the car as Asael shoots his prey point blank. The group examines the weapons they have collected, but more headlights appear in the distance, shining their beams straight at them. The brothers line up and open fire into the dazzling light. Peretz is hit, and Asael recoups more guns and runs into a field while Tuvia helps Peretz to his feet and pulls him away from the line of fire. He picks up another rifle and dashes into the bushes as an armored vehicle drives up. Soldiers jump off the back and run after Asael, who's haring across a field. Tuvia and Peretz stop by and watch the truck slowing down while a searchlight on its route picks out Asael running across the field. Armed Germans go after Asael, but their bullets whiz past him. The heavy searchlight is on the ground and picks out Tuvia, who fires straight at it, destroying the bulb. Asael is pursued like an animal, but he and Zus gather up their armory of guns and run. The next morning at their camp, sandy-haired Tuvia looks across at Zus with fury in his pale blue eyes. Laila is scraping the bottom of a cooking pot with a ladle. Shimon, in his hat, coat, and woolen scarf, watches her grimly, and others in the camp look pale and gaunt. Aron, chewing on a piece of bread, hands it to Rachel, the teenage girl, and she devours it. Tuvia turns to Malbin, who's sitting with Peretz, whose eyes are open but lifeless. Malbin shakes his head.",

Jules paces in Jimmie's bedroom on another call, while the camera captures a glimpse into a hotel suite's main area where a crap game is played by gamblers and well-dressed ladies. The Wolf takes notes in a small notepad, then hangs up. A silver Porsche speeds toward Jimmie's house, and Jimmie answers the door to a tuxedo-clad man. This man, The Wolf, examines a car while Jules, Vincent, and Jimmie stand by. Jimmie exits, returns with coffee, and The Wolf outlines a plan of action. The Wolf heads to the bedroom with Jimmie, leaving Jules and Vincent in the kitchen. He pauses, steps toward someone, and makes a call before Jimmie brings a handful of linen. Jules and Vincent clean up the car's interior, Vincent washing windows, and Jules picking up pieces of skull and brain, becoming more bloodied than before. They line the car with bedspreads and quilts as The Wolf inspects it, and the two men, proud of their effort, stand aside in bloody clothes. Jimmie holds a trash bag, The Wolf a garden hose, and both follow The Wolf's instructions, receive soap, and scrub themselves under the hose's spray. Afterward, Jimmie hands them towels, and they dry off, now dressed in tee-shirts and swim trunks, contrasting their former appearance. Laughing, The Wolf and Jimmie watch as the garbage bag is placed in the car trunk, and The Wolf slams it closed.",

A picnic spread is laid out with a tablecloth, two goblets, a small leather wine container, some cheese, and a couple of apples on a lovely spot high on the edge of a mountain path with a view to the sea. The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, and slows. The two men study each other, and the Man In Black nods and comes nearer while Vizzini pushes his knife harder against Buttercup's throat. Buttercup gasps against the pain as the Man In Black stops fast and nods again. Vizzini fills the goblets with wine as the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing and hands it to Vizzini. As Vizzini's pleasure grows, the Man In Black's decreases, and Vizzini suddenly points behind the Man In Black, who turns to look. Vizzini switches the goblets while the Man In Black's head is turned, and Vizzini starts to laugh as they both pick up their goblets. Vizzini hesitates, then drinks after the Man In Black, and he sits silently, watching the Man In Black, until he falls over dead. The Man In Black steps past Vizzini's corpse, removes Buttercup's blindfold and bindings, and she notices Vizzini lying dead. The Man In Black pulls her to her feet and leads her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain, where Fezzik fought the Man In Black.

    "1186": "Behind the shield, a faint light flashes on and off from the bedroom window of a suburban house. The light is flashing from beneath a bed sheet. Harry Potter suddenly emerges from under the sheet and pretends to be asleep. Uncle Vernon, wearing a dressing gown, puts on the light and glares around the room. He switches off the light and goes out. Harry pulls the sheet back over his head. He waves the wand over a spell book. The wand glows brightly. It glows even more brightly. The light flashes again under the sheet. Uncle Vernon looks in again, but Harry pretends to be asleep. Harry snuggles down in bed. Daylight. Aunt Marge thrusts a wet umbrella at Harry. She bustles into the sitting room with her bulldog with her. She greets her nephew, Dudley. Harry clears the table. Ripper licks her plate. She gives Ripper brandy and glares at Harry. Uncle Vernon gives Harry a warning look. Her glass shatters. She clicks her fingers at Harry. Harry shakes with rage. Lights start to flash and plates rattle. As Aunt Marge wags her finger at Harry, the tip begins to swell. Her cheeks bulge. Her bottom swells to fill the chair. Ladders appear in her stockings as her legs grow to twice their normal size. The seams on her tweed jacket burst apart. Her neck inflates. The top button of her blouse pings across the room and hits the clock. Vernon and Petunia watch with horror. Dudley goes on eating. Ripper bites Vernon's leg. Aunt Marge rises into the air. The beads of her necklace scatter. She bursts out of the chair. A flying button hits Dudley. A second button knocks him sideways. Marge grabs the tablecloth. She floats even higher and hits the ceiling. Aunt Marge turns upside down showing her bloomers and floats into the conservatory. She bumps against the glass roof. She sails out into the garden. Vernon struggles after her with Ripper clinging to his leg. He grasps her hands. Ripper's still attached. All three are lifted off the ground. Vernon lets go and falls onto the grass. Aunt Marge floats away like a huge balloon. Helplessly, Vernon and Petunia gaze after her. Dudley is still eating and watching television. Harry quickly runs upstairs, angrily kicking the cupboard. He sits on his bed. He looks at the photograph on the bedside table of his parents dancing happily together. He drags his trunk down the stairs. He points his wand at Vernon. Harry leaves the house dragging his trunk on a small set of wheels. In the distance, Aunt Marge is a faint speck in the darkening sky. Harry walks quickly, breathing hard as he pulls the heavy trunk along the deserted streets.",
    "482": "Mary opens the door and looks in to see Cassidy drinking from a large tumbler; he winks at her without pausing in his drinking. She remains on the threshold for a moment, then crosses to the desk, talking as she goes. Mary then slams down on the brake, trying to pull herself together, as the Patrolman raps again, less gently. Reluctantly, she rolls down the window, and the Patrolman studies her for a moment. Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she had placed it when she stretched out for sleep, and puts her hand in it, rummaging for her wallet but cannot find it. The Patrolman is staring at her, and she glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, and realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents. Nervously, trying to control her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, then the important papers envelope, and a couple of other items, placing them on the seat, finally finding her wallet, opening it, and handing it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at the car, and walks around to the front of the car to check the license plate before returning. The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the steering wheel, and returns Mary's wallet, and she takes it, looking at him for a flicker of a moment before starting ahead fast. As she drives, she glances into her rear-view mirror to see the Patrolman following in his automobile at a matched speed. She glances out at her surroundings and sees the freeway ahead before suddenly turning off the highway and checking her mirror to see that the Patrolman is no longer following and has not turned off after her. Breathing a sigh of relief, she thinks for a moment and makes a quick decision as she gets out of the car, glances toward the lot office, and turns her attention to the line of cars, noticing the California license plates on all of them. The car dealer calls out from his office, and Mary nods, starting to walk along the line of cars as if making a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot, and she stares at the papers, turns away as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a Los Angeles newspaper, and starts back into the car lot, glancing worriedly at the front page. As she goes, the same Patrolman is seen coming up the street toward the lot, and he sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, and stops by the curb.

White flowers float on the surface of the rooftop swimming pool as immaculately dressed glitterati mingle and sip champagne. Sidney saunters over to Alison carrying a plate piled high with finger foods, as three beautiful women slink by, and Lawrence walks off into the crowd. Party guests whip out their mobile phones in response to the ring tone, and a glamorous woman in her fifties approaches heavy-featured, debonair Lawrence. Lawrence drifts off with goateed Vincent, as Sidney approaches Rachel, who stands by herself looking out over the city. She looks at him suspiciously, but then, beaming, she puts down her champagne. Sidney hands her a napkin and a pen, and she hands him her autograph, making Sidney grin as he rejoins the others. Eleanor gestures to a besuited young man on the opposite side of the pool, who dutifully taps Sophie on the shoulder, and she turns to face Eleanor. Sophie is resplendent in a backless white halter-neck dress, causing Sidney's jaw to drop, while Eleanor waits for her to join them. Pulling up to the poolside, Sophie looks around for an appropriate route but is hemmed in by guests absorbed in conversation. Smiling, she scratches her head, then kicks off her glittering high heels before stepping fully clothed into the pool. Photographers take pictures as she lifts her sleek, jet-black hair over her head and wades gracefully towards Eleanor, clutching her long hair in a bun and smiling flirtatiously for the camera. She pulls herself up out of the water, her wet dress clinging to the sinuous curves of her lean, shapely body, as Eleanor speaks on her cell phone as they leave. Sophie and Eleanor lead the way outside, where a bustling crowd of press photographers ask for Sophie's attention, and Sidney shields his eyes from the glare of the flashing cameras and puts a coat over Sophie's shoulders as they head towards a waiting car. Sidney tries to squeeze into the car beside Sophie and her Chihuahua, and they walk together. Sidney stops with a frown as Alison strides off and later sits at his computer. Lawrence throws him a newspaper, and a woman delivers a basket of flowers to Lawrence, who reads the gift tag. Gray-haired Lawrence gives Sidney a prickly look, then walks away, while Alison looks at a tight-lipped Sidney and shrugs as he turns back to his computer. Sidney zips up his fly as he rounds a corner into a white-walled corridor, where he sees Elizabeth Maddox approaching and stops anxiously in his tracks as she stumbles and falls down in a heap in front of him, while Alison watches with bated breath from the end of the corridor. Slack-jawed, Sidney gawks at her, and she raises her eyebrows.",
    "942": "Mycroft winces as Watson enjoys himself at the gaming tables and Mycroft chats to some other men. Holmes goes upstairs to investigate where he saw a bearded man carrying a nosegay appear from behind the curtains earlier. Holmes parts the curtains and sees nosegays lying on a table. A woman stands with her back to him, and he puts coins in a shell-shaped bowl. The high cheekboned brunette turns around, and Holmes sits. Madam Sim lights a match from a candle and picks up a pack of tarot cards. Holmes stares intently at the pack and places a finger on his forehead, takes the pack from her, and flicks through them. He lays the Devil card down on the table, reaches inside his jacket, takes out the letter, and drops it on the table. Sim looks amazed and picks it up, finding inside a sketch of a man with a goatee beard, and says, \"That is the price I must pay to change the course of history.\" She looks up from the letter as he gives her a look and gets up. She reaches for a gun, while he picks up an umbrella and plans his attack on the Corsac in his mind. He swings the brolly, and the Corsac drops down. He knocks a knife from the man's hand and, in slow motion, karate-chops the Corsac about the face, followed by a kick in the groin and bludgeoning the man with the brolly. The Corsac lunges with a knife, but Holmes dodges the attack and hooks the umbrella handle around the man's throat, throws the man over his shoulder, and whacks him in the face. Now, for real, Holmes pulls the Corsac down from the rafters with the umbrella and disarms him. Sim kills the Corsac by throwing a knife into his chest. Holmes goes over to her, and as they leave, a man and two couples come in. The Corsac comes round, leaps to his feet, takes off his heavy coat in which Sim's knife is embedded, and brandishing another blade, goes after Holmes and Sim. He runs along the edge of a balcony within the building, somersaults off it down to a lower level, and heads off Holmes and Sim. Holmes throws the Corsac, who back-flips off a wall and comes at him again. Meanwhile, on the ground floor, Watson is still playing cards, at least he's winning. Sim whacks the Corsac over the head with a bottle. Holmes twists his arm and throws him onto a sofa. They struggle, and the Corsac's blade scrapes Holmes' cheek. Holmes recoils as the Corsac goes after Sim. Holmes gives chase and tackles him to the floor, but the Corsac springs up and grabs Sim by the hair.",
    "1371": "Oliver gets up, and Charlotte, Sadie, and Desi run off, followed by Oliver. Desi gracefully swims underwater, looking gorgeous, and she sees Jason and Ronnie underwater, appearing grotesque, red-faced, and awkward. As they reach for each other and surface, Desi swims away. Larry talks to Oliver, who smiles, amused, while Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi. Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb, and Barry are eating as Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk. Oliver gets up to leave, walks out, and the party becomes tense. Debbie notices that Oliver never actually left; he stands at the back, looking uncomfortable and quietly singing, which shocks Debbie. She smokes a cigarette at the side of the house when Sadie appears, and Debbie, caught, turns and walks towards the house, with Sadie following. Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie, who continues down the hall, still followed by Sadie. Barb is in the kitchen with Pete and Charlotte as Debbie turns the corner and finds Pete stress eating in front of the fridge. Debbie storms off towards the foyer, where Larry stops her, and Claire and the triplets are right behind him. Pete throws his cupcake against the wall as Larry and Claire walk away and Pete storms in. Oliver passes Pete and turns to Debbie as Pete walks away, stunning Debbie, who follows him out to the front porch, closing the door behind them and looking at him for a moment. Larry opens the door and peeks out to reveal everyone at the party except Pete still in the foyer. From the side of the house, Pete is seen riding his bike in his street clothes and helmet, exiting home, very angry and riding with great emotion to release frustration. Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard and down the street; a car passes, and a teenager yells to scare him, causing Pete to almost fall. Debbie and Barb clean up and see Oliver picking up glasses, Sadie walking in with Joseph. Sadie walks off, followed by Joseph. The traffic clogs up and a car honks, almost causing Pete to ride into it as it makes a right turn; he pulls up alongside Jason's van, where Desi is riding with Jason, and they speed off. Oliver plays with the kids and an iPhone, Debbie walks outside, and exits.",
    "547": "Henry turns and grips the mounted machine gun with a perplexed expression and then pulls out his watch. Indy uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a time. Henry does as indicated, and the exploding gun nearly shakes him out of his seat as he has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger, causing the machine gun to fire repeatedly as the Messerschmidt banks to the left, but Henry keeps it in his gun sight. Henry inadvertently swings the gun around, while Indy looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father. The plane begins to go down, and Indy struggles to control its descent until the wheels touch down. Out of control, the plane skids and crashes first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond, sending a cloud of dust into the air. Indy pulls himself from the cockpit as guns blaze and bullets explode around them; Indy and Henry jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy as an old man kneels at his car repairing a rear tire. The man turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands, and suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling him. Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel, while Henry is a very nervous passenger. Indy sees a low-flying Messerschmidt coming up behind him in the side mirror, and as it roars by overhead, bullets explode around them, narrowly missing the car. The car races toward a tunnel that cuts through a steep, and the Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car with machine guns firing, but the car enters the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time and slams into the mouth of the tunnel, shearing off its wings. The flaming fuselage continues to rocket through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun, with sparks flying as its belly scrapes against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel. Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see the wingless ball of fire gaining on them, about to overtake them. The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road as the flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and explodes in the middle of the road. As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow and looks out the windshield to see a second Messerschmidt screaming out of the sky toward them. The Messerschmidt drops its single under-fuselage bomb, which explodes in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet. The car falls into the hole made by the bomb, and Indy climbs out, still in the bomb crater, and turns back to Henry.",
    "194": "A sharp whistle is heard as Ernie leans from the window, and Bert and the man put up travel posters to cover up the broken windows. Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door, then opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler, having accomplished this by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat. George enters, and they rush into each other's arms and hold each other in ecstasy, remaining embraced. They finish their song, and Ernie kisses Bert on the forehead before Bert slams Ernie's hat on his head. Meanwhile, the Martini family is moving, with Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, carrying out the last of the furniture. The family consists of Martini, his wife, and four kids of various ages, from two to ten. George and Mary help the Martinis move, surrounded by about a dozen neighbors. Mary gets in the front seat of the car with the baby in her arms, while the family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids. Outside one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles: George Bailey's rickety car and an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods. The rickety caravan starts off down the street to the cheers of the neighbors. The kids enter with screams of delight, amidst new lawns here and there and young trees, which promise to transform the area into a pleasant little middle-class section. George and Mary stand on the porch of the new house with the Martinis lined up before them while Sam Wainwright stands in front of his big black town car, epitomizing a successful, up-and-coming businessman. His wife, an attractive and sophisticated lady, is inside the car, dripping with furs and jewels. Sam watches George across the street, while Mrs. Martini and the Martinis cross themselves, shaking hands all around. Meanwhile, Potter is seated in his wheelchair at his desk with his goon beside him, as his rent collector, Reineman, talks and points to maps spread out on the desk. A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk before Reineman exits. He flips the switch on the dictaphone. Elsewhere, George and Mary talk to Sam Wainwright in front of his car, with Sam's wife, Jane, now out of the car. There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into their car, and the big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it. They slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.",
    "70": "DANTE hangs up and looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his head. He then sniffs the air as JAY, SILENT BOB, and OLAF lean against the wall. OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB and then looks the girls up and down, makes a metal face, laughs, shakes his head, and busts a crimson metal sneer, cackling deeply as the theme to Star Wars plays. Meanwhile, RANDAL leans back in his chair, stares up at the TV, stands, points the remote, clicks the TV off, and ponders before locking the door and walking away, while OLAF sings for the small crowd. The can pops off, and DANTE staggers back a few steps as the man rubs his hand and exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister away, and RANDAL follows him as he cleans up around the store. DANTE steps behind the counter with the BLUE-COLLAR MAN joining them. The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits, and DANTE and RANDAL remain respectfully quiet for a moment while RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face of utter disbelief at this lackadaisical video clerk, feeling flabbergasted but not put off. She smirks smugly at RANDAL and his paper, half turns to see if her comment was heard, and tries again with a different approach, but RANDAL continues to read on, even as she tries harder, louder, and more direct, holding up her rental choices. RANDAL reads on, as the INDECISIVE CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall. An angry WOMAN opens the door, storms out, and RANDAL hops over the counter, whipping the door open. Offended, he closes the door, stands momentarily appalled by her exiting remark, shakes his head, reaches behind the counter, grabs a ring of keys, exits, locks the door from the outside, ensures its security, and storms off opposite the woman. DANTE stares, open-mouthed, at something off-camera as RANDAL hurls the door open and launches into his tirade. An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by open cartons of eggs, holds an egg up to the light, studies it, grabs a carton from the cooler, pops it open, examines each egg, spins an egg on the floor, as RANDAL snickers at his friend, and both RANDAL and DANTE study the off-camera oddity.",
    "1218": "Sarah lingers and turns to Rambo, her blonde hair tied back in a bunch. On the riverside, Michael pauses and watches them, carrying a small bundle, while Rambo wears a concerned frown. Sarah stares at him sadly, smiles faintly, and places a small crucifix on a necklace into his enormous hand, which closes over the gift. She stares at him, then turns away and gets off the boat. On the bank, Michael hoists a bulky black rucksack onto his shoulders as Sarah walks up the gangplank and joins Michael. The party marches away with the peasant porters, heading inland over the head of a waterfall, with two bearers carrying a pole between them, from which a large carton hangs. Rambo's boat wends its way back down the river as Michael's party crosses a static body of water bordered by rocks and boulders, led by a man using a camcorder at the front of the party. Rambo's boat rounds a headland and comes upon the pirates' motorboat, floating near a bank. Rambo stares warily at it as they pass, noticing a single corpse lying on the deck near the abandoned machine gun. He grips the tiller firmly and guides his boat towards the pirate boat. The volunteers and bearers traipse over the brow of a hill, overlooking a settlement in the valley below, near a paddy field. Sarah looks about as Rambo pilots the pirate boat further up the river, his own boat following behind, piloted by one of his men. On the pirate boat, one of the pirate corpses has turned a mottled purple as the boat moves into a riverbank. Rambo locks off the motor and brings the pirate boat to a halt, grabs petrol cans and rope, and makes his way through the pirate corpses. Meanwhile, the volunteers approach the village, greeted by small children and adults alike. The village huts are built in the local style with wood and high foundations. Rambo flips the top of one of the cans, holds it above his head, and drenches the machine gun and pirate corpses with petrol. The villagers make Michael's party welcome as Rambo opens up another can, drowns the deck in more petrol, and the liquid washes pools of blood over the side of the boat. He throws an empty can into the hold of the boat, flips open, and lights a cigarette lighter. From his own boat, he tosses the lighter into the pirate boat, which bursts into flame. Stalks of rice plants stand upright in a paddy field below the village, where outside a hut, Sarah hands a book to a puzzled child. One of the volunteers gives an oral examination to a woman, and an old man plays a stringed instrument.",
    "317": "Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence, and Carlos, awestruck, hands over a box of cigarettes. Evan nervously approaches as Karl and Rick wait expectantly for him to enter, and they continue to stare. Rick stands, and Evan nods reluctantly, dropping to his knees, but before anything happens, Carlos bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch. Rick charges Carlos but trips on his pants, and Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face and snatches his journals from Karl's shelf. Evan frantically flips through them while other white supremacists charge the cell. Carlos drops Karl's writhing body and presses against the cell door. Evan finds an entry and focuses on the words as the supremacists force the door open, and the words begin to shimmer. Reverberant sounds of barking break the sound barrier, and images of Aryans storming the cell become a frenetic blur as Evan, now thirteen again, finds himself in the woods. Kayleigh and Lenny do a double take, and Evan roots through the trash to find a razor-sharp piece of metal, which he gives to Lenny. Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand and bolts away, with Lenny slowly following. Soon, Evan groans on the ground, writhing, as his words strike a chord with Tommy, whose anger dissipates. Tommy begins to untie the sack when Lenny suddenly appears, jamming the metal shard through Tommy's throat. Tommy gags on blood, and Evan surveys the scene in shock as Lenny drops to the floor, and Kayleigh wakes up screaming upon seeing the blood. Lenny is silhouetted against the sky, vibrating violently. In Evan's original college dorm, Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks as Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, indicating the outer lining of Evan's brain, while Andrea stares blankly. Dr. Redfield is awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. Evan discreetly checks his surroundings before using a security card to open a door, searching each room of the wing until he finds what moves him.",
    "581": "He heads towards her, and they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd. Susan is in pain now; she can't summon an answer. They regard each other, and after a long pause, they have reached an understanding. He takes her in his arms, and they dance away. On a distant fringe of the party, on a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe. His eyes are on Parrish and Susan; he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, and stops. Joe regards the Waiter for a moment. The Waiter hesitates, then moves off. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan; the dance number ends with a BOOM. On the dance floor, Parrish looks up and sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. Suddenly, he hugs her, holding her very close. She looks at him; he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches. They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe waits and regards Parrish, waiting until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues. Parrish waits, smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, and strides out again, Joe right with him. In tandem, they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky. Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill. She hesitates, then glides away from the party, her step quickening as she walks up towards the hill. Susan halts, and in the distance, a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared. He is heading straight for her; she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, and starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet. Now she stops again. It is a man who keeps coming, and now that he is close, she recognizes him. Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative. Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place. Some realization is dawning on Susan, rendering her lightheaded. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer. Susan holds herself very still. She searches the Young Man's eyes; his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. After a long silence, the words come out haltingly. Susan sighs, the Young Man smiles gently, and they are completely intent on each other. Susan smiles as the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, and the night fills with light.",
    "582": "A plane takes off from Orlando International Airport amid heavy clouds. In a room, a digital clock on a bedside table reads 7:13 and then turns to 7:14. A naked dark-haired woman, with her hair falling around her shoulders, sits up on a bed and then gets off the bed. A naked man sleeping on his stomach wakes up as the woman takes a purse and walks out of the room; the man picks up a cell phone, sits up in bed, drinks from an almost empty beer bottle, and watches the shapely woman reenter the room. The woman picks out some clothes, slips on a thong, and the man lights a cigarette while the woman lights a joint. The man lies on his back, the woman climbs on the bed and straddles the man, puts the joint to his lips, then gets off the bed. The man smokes a cigarette, sits up, and snorts a line of cocaine. He walks out of the room dressed in a black suit, sporting dark glasses under a pilot's cap, with an airplane pin on his lapel. As rain lashes the airport and lightning flashes in the distance, people run across the tarmac. The man, now in a raincoat, walks under a parked South Jet airplane, pauses near one of the wheels, opens his mouth, sprays some mouth freshener, trots to the mobile stairway leading to the passenger walkway, and slips on the first step. He joins the passengers through a side door and sits next to his co-pilot, Whitaker. Whip inhales oxygen and fidgets on his side of the cockpit as Ken watches him brush his hair. Meanwhile, a woman steps out of her room at Hotel Atlanta, carrying a folded-up massage table, wearing a dress, and showing a small tattoo on her shoulder. She pulls some bills from a bundle of cash, walks to a car, and places the massage table in the trunk. She smokes as she makes a call from the driver's seat, leans on the steering wheel, and lowers the phone to the passenger seat. A man snorts coke and looks Nicole over, while Brad drops his towel and holds a small square. Elsewhere, Margaret sits facing Trina. Back in the plane, Whip pushes the side-stick forward, the cockpit shakes, and Whip takes the yoke and pulls back as they ascend. The plane shakes, and items fall from the overhead bins. Ken casts an uneasy sideways glance at Whip, who, with eyes on the horizon, steers the plane through the rough air. He moves the side-stick forward, the altimeter slides quickly to the right as the plane rises, and they reach a clearing through clouds and bright sunlight as Whip levels out.",
    "13": "Jane picks up the address book, frowning, and we're across from her window, looking in as she speaks into the phone, though we can't hear her. Meanwhile, Barbara Fitts stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically with her eyes focused elsewhere. She is at least ten years younger than her husband and is pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way. Ricky enters and startles Barbara, who turns to him as she attempts to serve him bacon. Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then joins his father at the table. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal, and then he and Barbara look at each other, alarmed. The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up, and opens the front door to reveal the two Jims. Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables, and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia, as the Colonel stares at them, suspicious. The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel, who looks at them confused, but then it dawns on him. The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead, with Ricky in the passenger seat using a calculator and jotting numbers down in a notebook. The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply, and his eyes flash angrily. After a beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, he realizes a response is expected from him, so he sighs and then looks at his father. The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers, and Ricky goes back to his calculations, totaling two columns of numbers. Jane and Angela are standing with two other teenage girls, who then move away from them. The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile as Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her, looking at her intently with his eyes searching hers. Jane is unnerved and has to look away, so Ricky smiles and walks off while Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it. The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching television, and while the Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show, Barbara just stares. The Colonel chuckles at a joke and startles her, as the three of them stare at the TV like strangers in an airport. We follow them as they pass a sign, and inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting, while catering waiters serve hors d'oeuvres. Carolyn's jaw tightens, then she drags Lester toward a silver-haired man and his much younger wife, whom we recognize as Buddy Kane, the Real Estate King. Carolyn quickly joins in a little too loudly, smiling her most winning smile at him.",
    "165": "He turns and waves to the parlor window, where the three boys are — all bigger — and Ba holds a new addition; they all wave. Gandhi turns back and starts down the long, hilly street, gesturing Charlie on and starting to walk. Charlie nods uncertainly, looks back at the cab in confusion, signals the driver to follow, and hurries on to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace. They come to a turning, nearer to town, where the area is poorer and run-down. Ahead of them, three youths in working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against a building directly in their path. They react to the sight of Gandhi — fun — and stride the pavement menacingly. One of them tosses aside his cigarette, and Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head. Gandhi starts to move forward. Charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself. They are getting closer, with the youths laughing and whispering. One youth has flicked his cigarette hard, and it lands at Gandhi's feet. Gandhi pauses, looking at the youth, then starts forward again, almost on the youths, clearly frightened but determined. As he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement, a woman leans out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly. It is the first youth's mother, and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably. A snickering response comes from the other youths, who are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of the mother's attitude. Gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth, and steps around him, Charlie trailing, as the first youth stares at them sullenly. As they stride on, Charlie glances back, and Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner. They enter a busy street in the center of the town. Gandhi and Charlie come around the corner into it, and he pauses before an office where a young girl, Sonja, has come out to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting. He turns to Sonja, whose tone is loaded with foreboding, and Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly. Meanwhile, a strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document. Beneath the signature is the boldly printed identification: Jan Christian Smuts. A cameraman records the moment with a flash photo. General Smuts, whose presence matches his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document. The reporter standing opposite him is Walker, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral. Smuts has risen, knowing how to concede with grace. The gaze is firm, strong, and cynical, as the sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot.",
    "1144": "On his way out, Moody gives Harry a long look. The tadpole-like licorice snaps attract Harry's attention. He takes a handful. They nip his fingers with their sharp, little teeth. He drops them onto the floor and stomps on them. Behind him, the doors of a cabinet swing open. A blue light glows from a large, stone vase in front of a flicking mirror. Harry slowly walks towards it. Reflected in the mirror, he gazes down into the shining blue bowl. The cloudy surface swirls. Harry sees a glow at the bottom of a deep shaft. He finds himself falling down into a crowded courtroom. He lands in a chair, sitting next to someone he recognizes. The man next to him shakes hand with Professor Dumbledore right through Harry. A disheveled man appears in a cage in front of the judge, Mr. Crouch. Rita Skeeter gasps. Moody aims his wand at a young man hurrying from his seat. Barty is dragged to the bench. His tongue flickers like a snake. Mr. Crouch is transfixed, horrified. Harry falls from the bowl to the floor in Professor Dumbledore's room. He puts his wand to his temple and drops a thread of memory into the pensieve. Leaving Dumbledore's room, Harry hears voices from the open door of Snape's storeroom. Harry sees the dark mark on Karkaroff's arm. Karkaroff leaves quickly. He shows Harry a small bottle. Tiny Professor Flitwick conducts the school band. The stands are crowded with flag-waving supporters. An enthusiastic, Mr. Diggory runs in, encouraging the crowd to cheer as an embarrassed Cedric enters the arena. Fleur follows. Her classmates perform a cheerleader routine. Draco and his crony support Viktor Krum, who appears with Karkaroff. A concerned Dumbledore accompanies Harry who looks around nervously. Standing in front of a tall hedge, Dumbledore addresses the crowd. They gather around Dumbledore. Harry stands before a narrow opening in the hedge. Mr. Diggory hugs Cedric tearfully. Harry gives Cedric a friendly nod. Once again, Filch lights the cannon too soon. Moody pats Harry encouragingly on the shoulder as he tentatively enters the maze. Dumbledore watches him go. Harry looks back towards the entrance and sees Moody pointing surreptitiously to the left. He stares uncertainly down the narrow, misty path. Suddenly, the hedges close together behind him, blocking the way out. Harry swallows hard and follows the direction Moody has indicated. Each long path looks exactly the same. The thick, hewn hedges rise 25 feet on either side. Above his head, he can only see a narrow strip of sky. The intricate maze extends far around him stretching away into the distance of the mist-covered valley. Harry moves slowly and cautiously between the hedges. He turns and looks behind him fearfully.",
    "7": "The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, then pulls the drapes shut. Cars zoom past in the rain while Carolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a motivational tape on the stereo. Carolyn leans over, opens the glove compartment, and takes out her Glock. Jane stands across the room, and Angela is sprawled across the bed as there is a knock on the door. Jane jumps up, opens the door, and lets him in. Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door and exits, slamming the door behind her. Jane turns to Ricky, and he takes her in his arms. Angela sits on the stairs, shaken and crying. We move slowly toward the Burnham's garage window through the rain. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses, and the Colonel standing outside, watching. We zoom slowly in on the Colonel as he watches, transfixed. Lester finishes his last rep, racks the weights, sits up sweaty and out of breath, and then glances at us, aware he's being watched. Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the window as we're directly outside the garage door, slowly revealing Lester smiling at us. The rain comes down in sheets with a sharp clap of thunder. The Colonel moves stiffly, seems preoccupied and slightly disoriented, and just stands there looking at Lester before moving closer and grinning. Lester grins as well and places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel closes his eyes and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned and then pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face crumples in shame as he stares at the floor, blinking, then turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night. Carolyn is still listening to the same motivational tape, holding the Glock in her hand, before she switches the tape off and puts the gun in her purse. The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder. Lester enters, opens the refrigerator, grabs a beer, opens it, and starts toward the family room. Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer. As we move slowly around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the stereo, holding a CD case. She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair is mussed. She regards us apprehensively, then puts on a slightly defiant smile. Angela smiles as Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand.",
    "971": "Turning the corner, David runs down another street and catches up to Elise as she makes another turn on foot. She stops, grins, squirms, takes a breath, and eyes him. Meanwhile, a man runs down a corridor; it's the boyish officer. He opens a door marked Mr. Richardson and finds the veteran officer at his desk. The messenger shows a map book, and the officer grabs his brown fedora. In the hall, he passes Harry, who doffs his hat, and the boyish officer, now sporting his own hat, follows Richardson through a door. They arrive in a cafe co-room and see David and Elise. The boyish officer checks his map book, and a host seats them. His book shows pulsing red dots. Outside, David glances aside, and at their outdoor table, Elise smiles to herself and peeks at David. The officers share a table as David glances around while a server fills his water glass. Richardson and his aide follow a walkway to a spot overlooking the outdoor dining area, where the aide checks his map book, and a red inflection point pulses larger. Charlie and a third officer arrive, and Charlie pays the check. Elise grins at David, while Richardson and his aide look on. As David and Elise go to kiss, Richardson triggers a text to Charlie, whose interjection prevents the kiss. David nods amiably and gives Elise a long kiss on the cheek, and a relieved Richardson bows his head as she nods, smiling radiantly. Later, by the Brooklyn Bridge, David exits a Town Car and shakes many hands, then takes the podium before a crowd of hundreds. The gathering overlooks the East River, and Richardson's aide gets a text that the rehearsal has been moved back to Cedar Lake. David peers across the river to Pier 17. In a quaint eclectic apartment, Elise puts on a hoodie and picks up her cell, reading a text message that rehearsal is back at Cedar Lake, not Pier 17. David's senate race gathering wraps up, and he spies Richardson in a window. Both Adjustment officers duck out of sight, and David frowns at the Pier 17 structures across the river while Richardson pouts. David stares at the now empty window. A large water taxi crosses the river, and David rides aboard it as the skipper pilots it to the pier. David hurries onto the platform and up some stairs, following a covered walkway alongside a commercially refurbished warehouse. Finding a studio door chain-locked, he makes a call on his cell, but his phone reads disconnected, call failed, searching for signal. With a determined gaze, David jogs off the pier as Richardson and his aide observe. The officers follow David in the map book, and David rounds a corner, coming face to face with the two officers.",
    "1047": "McCullough proffers the phone as Ashton stares at them soberly, and a bomb explodes on the ground floor of the hotel. Ashton goes to the window and peers down at strewn bodies and flaming debris while McCullough holds out the phone and shoots Ashton a solemn look. A blast blows the door open and throws them to the floor, and a man in a balaclava enters holding a pistol. He dispatches Heinkin, McCullough, and Cavic then trains the pistol on the President, who cowers in a corner. A bright, white flash occurs, and events run in reverse order. Gunshots are fired, and black smoke rises from the bomb blast as the President's double is shot. Ashton sits safely in his limousine while Anna receives an ice cream cone and nods, and seated, Sam smiles at Anna. Veronica talks with a handsome, heavy-featured man, Javier, and she holds up a bracelet. Javier glares at her and flexes his jaw as raven-haired Veronica produces a cell phone and plays him a video of a bound and gagged man in his 20s. He grabs her wrist, takes the bracelet, grabs her head, and glowers, inches from her face, before letting go and striding off. Javier's eyes meet with Enrique's as they pass each other, and Javier walks past curly-haired Marie and pony-tailed Anna. Seated at his table in the cafe, Sam toggles through screens on his PDA phone, uses a touch screen wand to initiate a phone call, and glances at the television. A bellboy answers a phone in the hotel reception, and Felipe the bellboy hangs up the phone as the motorcade enters the underground parking lot. Javier answers his mobile and takes the phone from his ear, then gasps as he approaches the hotel. Sam punches buttons on his phone and talks into the mic of his hands-free kit. On TV, Ashton's double approaches the podium and pushes a button. A police constable scans Javier with a metal detector outside the Hotel Vesta, points at Javier's pocket, and Javier takes out a cell phone. Felipe opens the door for a woman entering the hotel. Javier approaches, shakes a man’s hand, placing a small envelope into it, and enters the lobby, which is filled with Secret Service agents. Javier talks into his cell phone as he passes the suited agents, lowers his phone, and calls an elevator. He turns the credit card-sized envelope in his hands. Sam steps out of the cafe onto the sunny street, the wire from his hands-free kit trailing down his white T-shirt to the phone in his hand, as the huge enclosed square of the plaza is surrounded by terra cotta colored buildings. Inside, Sam, holding a small Spanish flag, strolls to the back of the crowd.",
    "146": "The scene begins with another angle where some of the marchers turn at a shout, while a few of the tail-enders are watching, some running clear of the police, and some being beaten. Two police officers have a man on the ground, and one policeman looks up. Patel leans with one arm on a table, feeling as devastated as Gandhi, while looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand. It is a New York Times, and a picture of a severed head lying in smoldering ashes is glimpsed. Nehru and Azad are in the background with Desai, and Jinnah, dressed in a finely cut European suit, is among others who are dressed in tunics of homespun. They turn to Jinnah with a sense of surprise but do not really believe he means his statement. Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah, while Azad senses and fears what is going to happen, keeping his eyes fixed on Gandhi. Patel looks at him with mounting annoyance as Gandhi listens, withdrawn into himself. Jinnah turns away in anger, Patel sighs, and Nehru feels helpless but continues to try. Gandhi stares into nothing, mulling things over, while Nehru is surprised. Nehru ignores the thought and, like Azad, focuses on the real danger. Gandhi looks up at him with resigned fatalism. Mirabehn walks across the grounds toward Gandhi’s bungalow, carrying a small tray with a pitcher and a glass. In the background, a few people work while a mass of people camp near the entrance, all waiting. The steps of Gandhi's bungalow are shown, where a doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch, reading, with a stethoscope and blood pressure equipment on a small table beside him. He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps and nods. Mirabehn reaches the doorway and is stopped. In the shadows, Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed, holding him as he experiences a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall. When he finishes, he lies almost limp in her arms, and she gently lowers him to the mat, stroking his head. Mirabehn stiffens herself, not yet a devotee and nurse, removes her sandals, and walks across the room. She strokes Gandhi's sweating head again, touches his shoulder, and then gets up. For a moment, the two women hold each other's gaze. Ba smiles weakly, leaning her head into the taller Mirabehn's shoulder, then straightens and leaves without looking back. Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhi's side.",
    "443": "Helen and Wick watch Don, and Don's face relaxes into an innocent grin as his eyes meet Helen's, while hers are infinitely distressed. Wick has twisted the string off the bottle and, with the bottle in his hand, moves through the living room toward the kitchenette. Don looks after him and then follows him, a stubborn smile on his lips. Wick steps to the sink, opens the bottle, turns it upside down, and lets the whiskey run out. Helen trails after them, acutely embarrassed. Don and Helen reach the doorway from the living room and stand watching. Don feels as though he is watching the execution of a very good friend, but with Helen's eyes on him, he maintains his nonchalant expression. Once the bottle is emptied, Wick puts it in the sink, shrugs, and goes to the hall for his hat. Helen kisses him on the mouth, a woman hopelessly in love. She turns to go, but Don holds her back; then, to prevent him from seeing her moist eyes, she turns and hurries into the entrance hall. Wick turns toward Don, who has followed Helen to the entrance hall. Helen comes quickly out, takes a handkerchief from her bag, and hurries past Wick into the hall. Wick stands, hat in hand, holding the door open, then goes out, shutting the door behind him. Don rushes to the door, pressing his ear against it to hear what Wick and Helen are saying outside. The passage is narrow and simple, with a light bracket always burning every so often down the stair. A skylight, somewhat obscured by dirt and dust, lights the fourth floor back. They descend a few steps, and Wick quickly takes Helen's arm as they continue down the stairs. Don stands at the door, panic on his face, wondering if his brother has discovered the other two bottles. He puts the chain on the door to ensure his privacy, then dashes into the bathroom. Don rushes in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register in the side wall, pries it open with the file, looks inside, puts his hand in, looks at the hole wide-eyed, pushes the grille back, and runs out. He then runs in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch, and reaches under the side of it towards the wall. His hand explores among the springs. He sits up with a face covered in sweat, takes out his handkerchief, and wipes his face. Just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is the noise of a key being turned in the lock. The door opens as far as the chain will allow, stopping with a sharp bite of metal on wood.",
    "176": "Ray Bones steps on Harry's neck with his shoe, pinning him to the floor, and Harry can't speak because his jaw is broken. Harry looks sad lying there, pinned beneath Ray Bones' shoe, wondering how it all went so wrong. As a crumpled heap, Harry looks up and we see his bloody, pummeled face as Ray Bones quickly crosses the room, pulls a 9mm from his coat pocket, and aims it at Harry's face. Ray Bones looks over when Ronnie Wingate strolls into the office, and Harry looks glad to see him. Ronnie opens his jacket so Ray Bones can see the .357 tucked into his belt. Bones looks at the gun, looks up at Ronnie standing there, hands on his hips, jacket open, then raises his own gun. Harry looks pleadingly at Ray Bones, then rolls over onto his side. Meanwhile, Chili is sitting in a chaise longue by the pool with a beer in hand, and Karen watches him from the doorway. He looks over, and she comes over and sits down. Chili looks at Karen for a moment, and as she feels him staring, she keeps her eyes on the sunset and tries to change the subject. Chili looks at her, puts his drink down, leans over, and kisses her. Later, Karen and Chili lie in bed together, and she looks at him before leaning over to kiss him. They both jerk upright as Doris leads them towards the triage area, where they exchange a look and follow her in. Doris smiles as two uniformed cops walk past Harry, who lies in bed in a pain-killer stupor, with his face swollen and purple and both eyes black. They all look over as a Resident walks over, trailed by several, and they step back as the Resident pulls the curtain shut, blocking their view of Harry. Meanwhile, standing beside a giant mutant maggot or something, Bo Catlett looks at the Bear and smiles at Farrah. Bear watches uncomfortably as Farrah sits down with Bo, who looks up at the Bear and winks at Farrah, then keeps his mouth close to her ear and opens the door for her. Chili's minivan is parked out front, and as the valet drives off with it, a cab pulls up and Harry, with his hands bandaged and neck in a massive brace, gets out. Harry waves them off, points to himself, and mumbles through his wired jaw, then pushes past them and limps up the steps while all eyes are on him as they're led to a table.",
    "129": "In contrast to those around him, there is tension in Godse's face, an air of danger in his movements. He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip, then looks back at another Tonga that pulls up just behind his. Two young men, Apte and Karkare, meet Godse's gaze, and again there is a sense of imminent danger. They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. Sitting alone in the shadows of a stationary Tonga a little distance down the street, an elderly man named Prakash with a short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching. Apte and Karkare look back at him. There is just the slightest acknowledgment, and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business. Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance. He stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of Prakash. Prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate. A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man. Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. He is seen distantly through the crowd. He is not seen clearly until the very last moment, only glimpses of him as he smiles and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. Godse slides through to the very front rank. His breathing is short, and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. Now, for an instant, Gandhi is seen close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him. Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face, then moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu and knocking a vessel for incense from her hands. Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma.",
    "600": "Bellatrix sets down the ornament and glares at Snape. Narcissa glances at her sister then looks anxiously back to Snape, stands, and they both stare at Bellatrix. Bellatrix steps towards Snape, moves behind him, but then walks away while staring, open-mouthed. Narcissa and Snape grasp each other's right wrist, and Bellatrix waves her wand, causing a glowing cord to bind their wrists together. Narcissa stares unwaveringly at Snape as Bellatrix stands close to him. The cord binding their wrists fades and disappears, Narcissa releases her grip, and flexes her wrist. At a shop called Pieces of Modern Magic, outside, a mechanical man makes the rabbit on his head disappear under a big top hat. The Weasley twins are present, a boy looks sick, and Ron watches a mechanical toy of Dolores Umbridge balancing on a tightrope. A boy walks up a wall. Harry spots a strange substance, and the twins give him some. A handsome youth, Cormac, smiles at Hermione who puts down a love potion. Ron turns to Hermione and Harry, and they pass Lavender, a girl with curly hair, who watches him go. Outside, a little dragon breathes flames, roasting chestnuts, which a boy buys before sliding down a chute into a bag. They're in Diagon Alley and enter the empty and burned-out shop the Death Eaters attacked, with Harry leading, followed by Ron and then Hermione. Ron stops by a window and looks out. Narcissa and Draco look around furtively before entering a narrow alley. The trio leave Ollivander's and peek around the corner where there's a wanted poster for Fenrir Greyback, the bearded Death Eater who attacked the shop. They follow the Malfoys down the gloomy alleyway as the Malfoys descend steps to a shop with a sign above its door, Borgin and Burke. Narcissa strides in, and Draco follows, while the three friends look up as a light comes on in an arched window in the rear of the shop. They climb onto an adjoining roof and watch as the Malfoys are led across a courtyard below into a high room that reaches from the ground floor to the roof. They see Draco running his hands over a tall, triangular, embossed wooden cabinet, and several figures approach Draco as Harry hauls himself up to get a better view. Narcissa kisses her son's cheek, and someone appears at a window. Harry, Hermione, and Ron duck down as a thin-faced man with a beard looks out and lowers the blind. Harry looks up and breathes a sigh of relief. The Hogwarts Express chugs through barren moorland, where Luna holds magazines and Ginny has a Pygmy Puff. Ginny reads the cover, and Luna saunters along the corridor with her magazines. Further back on the train, Hermione, Harry, and Ron have a compartment to themselves.",
    "339": "Theoden bows slightly to the hooded figure and leaves, shooting Aragorn a strange look as he goes. The figure stands and pulls back the hood to reveal Elrond. Elrond's face is etched with pain. Aragorn receives this news, ashen-faced. Elrond's eyes fall to the Evenstar, which hangs around Aragorn's neck. Aragorn looks at Elrond in shock. A fleet of black sails moves along a silver ribbon of water. Elrond hesitates a beat. A sudden wind rushes through the tent, lifting hangings, scattering maps, knocking over goblets. As Aragorn looks at Elrond, an image flashes in his mind's eye of the ghostly figure on the Dimholt Road. Aragorn looks at Elrond in shock. Aragorn's eyes fall to a plain black scabbard, which Elrond draws from beneath his robes. Elrond's long white fingers draw the hilt of a sword from the scabbard to reveal an Elven sword glinting in the firelight. Aragorn takes the sword, staring at it in wonder. Aragorn draws the long blade from its sheath. Elrond stares hard at Aragorn. A heavy silence hangs in the room. Aragorn re-sheathes the sword. As Aragorn readies Brego for leaving, Eowyn approaches, her temper barely held in check. Aragorn looks over his shoulder at her and then rounds on her. Aragorn looks at her sadly, not wanting to hurt her. Eowyn steps back as though struck; she watches stricken as Aragorn leaves. Aragorn leads his horse through the tents towards the Dimholt Road. A light flares ahead of him, and a short figure steps out of the shadows, pipe in hand. Aragorn looks at Gimli, grateful for his courage but determined to go alone. Aragorn looks at Legolas as he appears, leading his horse, already saddled. Gimli steps closer to Aragorn. Aragorn shakes his head, smiling his acceptance. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli slowly ride towards the back of the plateau, past the ancient standing stones that lead to the narrow pass. Theoden and Gamling watch the retreating figures of Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli. Rohan soldiers emerge from their tents, crestfallen to see Aragorn leave. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli disappear into the shadows of the mountains. Theoden moves forward and looks at Eowyn, who stands as if turned to stone, looking up at a lightening sky, the quiet before the men depart for war. Eowyn turns to the king, her face a blank. Theoden moves towards her, taking up her hand. Eowyn slowly lifts her head. Theoden lifts Eowyn's face to look into her eyes. Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli make their way up a gloomy canyon, shadowed by black fir trees. The shadowed ridges of the Dwimorberg Mountain rise before them. It is a spooky place. Silence surrounds them; there are no birds, no wind.",
    "463": "The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope and tugs off his leather boots, amazed to see several large rocks tumble out. He wears gloves, and Inigo stares at them, baffled by the question that arises as he glances up. He hands his sword to the Man In Black, and even now, this still brings pain. The Man In Black looks up at Inigo, and on that word, what begins is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies. Right from the beginning, it looks different as the Six-Fingered Sword feints here and there. The two men, after teasing, begin to duel in earnest, their swords crossing repeatedly with sound coming so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, forcing the Man In Black to retreat up a rocky incline, shifting his style as he perches at the edge of an elevated castle ruin. Inigo stares down at him and, with the grace of an Olympian, flies off the perch, somersaulting over the Man In Black's head to land facing him. The two men almost fly across the rocky terrain, maintaining balance and finesse, with the advantage shifting back and forth. Meanwhile, the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity draws closer behind them. Inigo fights with skill, but the Man In Black gradually gains the advantage, forcing Inigo back towards the deathly brink. Inches from defeat, Inigo remains all smiles and switches the six-fingered sword to his right hand, turning the tide of battle. The Man In Black, stunned, does everything he can to keep Inigo by the cliff edge, but to no avail. Slowly at first, then faster, Inigo gains control, and the Man In Black retreats desperately. The six-fingered sword becomes almost invisible with Inigo's ferocious attack as he switches styles again. Facing a rocky staircase leading to a turret-shaped plateau, the Man In Black retreats madly up the steps, unable to stop Inigo, who is unstoppable as the Man In Black, in a frenzy, makes every feint and thrust, letting go with all he has left.",
    "232": "Szpilman is in a messy room and goes into the kitchen, where he takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel from a bread tin and unwraps it. As he continues attempting to cut the bread, there's a loud hammering on the front door, causing him to stiffen. The hammering persists as Szpilman stumbles into the room, looking around in confusion. Female voices are heard indistinctly from the other side of the door, prompting Szpilman into action. He hurriedly puts on a crumpled jacket, grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects some of his belongings, and stuffs them into a paper bag. When the hammering stops, Szpilman cautiously approaches the door, listens, and then opens it quietly to slip out. He exits the flat, descends the stairs, and stops abruptly upon encountering Kitty, a young and fierce woman, blocking his way. Hesitating as she shouts louder, Szpilman musters all his strength to dash past her, clattering down the stairs to the ground-floor landing. Another woman attempts to stop him, but he pushes past her and exits the house into heavy snow. Szpilman stumbles into the street, runs, and darts down a side street, entering a narrow passage. He stops, nearly collapsing, but maintains control, leaning against a wall. Removing a shoe, he retrieves a scrap of paper from Gebczynski and reads it before dragging himself through the snow and slush to a villa. He rings the doorbell, which is answered by Dorota, who is pregnant. They stare at each other momentarily before Szpilman follows Dorota into the living room and sits down slowly. An awkward silence ensues as he gazes at her while she looks away. After a brief silence, Michal Dzikiewicz enters the room, sees Szpilman, and shakes his hand. Dizzy, Szpilman leans on the table for support as he and Dorota watch him. Later, Szpilman is asleep on the sofa, awakened by the sound of a cello. He opens his eyes, listens, swings his legs off the sofa, stands, and quietly opens a door to see another room. He sees Dorota, partially turned away, playing Bach on the cello, and listens intently. Hearing a padlock being unlocked, followed by a key turning in a Yale lock, the door opens for Michal and Szpilman to enter a flat with a large, sparsely furnished room containing an upright piano and a bed.",
    "952": "Joe, Alice, and Cary pick themselves up and watch as a steady stream of metallic bits and pieces stream up towards the water tower and meld into the ever-growing structure on top of it. Alice smiles as the vast structure begins to take shape. A Jeep drives up, and Joe sees his dad and Louis get out of it. Jack looks up at the water tower, then spots Joe. Joe nudges Alice, who looks around and sees her dad with Jack. The dads walk towards them, and Joe and Alice go to meet them. Jack cups Joe's face in his hands, then hugs him tightly; their faces are tense with a mixture of emotion and relief. Eyes closed, they hold each other tight. Alice looks over at her father as he steps up to her. They regard each other for a moment, then hug. Joe looks over Jack's shoulder at the water tower and sees the alien climbing up it. The creature steps into the now fully formed spaceship it's created on top of the water tower, and the door closes behind it. The spaceship powers up, and several arms on it rotate. Many bright lights on the arms shine out. Joe separates from his father and is just in time to grab his mother's locket, which is being drawn towards the tower. It hangs in the air, pulled by an invisible force. The locket clicks open, revealing the picture inside, which is of Joe's mother holding him as a baby. Joe lets go of the locket's chain, and it floats up towards the water tower. Joe and the others watch as the locket sticks to the side of the tower. Suddenly, the tower explodes in a shower of water, deluging the street below. The spaceship, which resembles the canopy of a palm tree, lifts into the air. The water tower collapses and crashes down into the street, scattering soldiers standing there and crushing their vehicles. Joe, Alice, Louis, and Jack watch as the spacecraft gains altitude in a blaze of bright lights. Hobbling through town, Charles and Martin sit sailing up into the night sky. Still stoned in his car, Donny slumbers on as the spaceship flies by, its lights reflected in his windshield. As they watch it recede into the distance, Joe and Alice hold hands. Smiles spread across their faces. The spacecraft becomes a dot of light high up in the sky. Gradually, it becomes a pinpoint and then dies away altogether. A chalk outline of a body is drawn on the floor. Martin arrives as the detective and talks to a witness at Romero Chemicals. Martin gets up and puts his hat on. Preston, as the President, makes a call.",
    "1381": "As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the bell continues to chime. At this point, the time reversal ends, and the room is empty except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion while Hermione ignores the question and eyes the clock on the wall. Hermione grabs Harry's arm and slams through the door as they come to a mad, huffing halt. She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry follows her gaze and blinks in disbelief as he sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths. Dumbfounded, Harry turns as Hermione holds up the hourglass. A soft smack is heard, and they turn to see Malfoy land on the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rubbing his kisser. Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge, and seconds later, footsteps clamor over their heads. Seconds later, Harry emerges and marvels at the sight of himself, Hermione, and Ron heading down the slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin patch, and Harry nods, then looks toward the hut where Hagrid is handing Scabbers to Ron. As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him and speaks fiercely, then watches Fudge and the others drawing closer. She frowns and glances into the hut. Just then, on the ground beside her, Hermione notices a jagged star-shaped stone and instantly grabs it, rises, and hurls it through the open window. Smash! The sound of a glass jar shattering is heard within the hut. Hermione ignores him and swiftly whistles a second stone through the window, hitting the back of Harry's head. Crows begin to drop atop the roof as Fudge's party arrives and raps on the door. Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope, and with the coast clear, they slip out of the trees. As Harry vaults into the patch, the crows stir, cawing at his ankles and pecking at his feet. Buckbeak refuses to move. Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along and disappear into the forest just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie. Harry and Hermione, their view unobstructed by the low stand of trees this time, watch the Executioner approach the pumpkin patch. Quickly, the confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger as the Executioner lifts his blade and, with a brutal fury, plunges it into the flesh of a pumpkin with a sickening chop. The crows scatter to the skies as Harry and Hermione race through the trees with Buckbeak loping easily behind. In a subjective point of view, they glide through a thicket of trees to the forest's edge where the trees thin, revealing the Whomping Willow thrashing. Hermione disappears down the hole, then a figure approaches the tree: Lupin.",
    "1105": "Thao meets Walt near the house, and Walt grabs his arm. Thao starts to walk away, stops and looks back, then goes. Walt wanders off, frowning. Spider and one of his sidekicks come out of a house and walk over to a Honda parked by the curb. They get in, watched from across the road by Walt, parked in his pickup truck, who grim-facedly watches the Honda drive off. Walt picks up his Colt .45 automatic and cocks it, then talks to Daisy. He gets out of the pickup truck. As Smokie comes out of the house, Walt grabs him, throws him onto the lawn, and kicks him repeatedly in the face, following up with a few punches. A cat scampers past, and Walt draws his gun. In the evening, it's raining as Walt drives his pickup truck back to his house. He parks on his drive, gets out with Daisy, walks up the steps onto the porch, and Daisy crosses his path. He bends down, picks up a key from under an ornament, winces as he straightens up, and unlocks the door. He and Daisy go inside. Walt cooks a barbeque for Sue, Thao, their mother, and Youa. Youa and Thao grin and nod. Walt points at the Gran Torino. Walt sits in his living room with Daisy, sipping a beer and watching a ball game on TV. Spider's car cruises down the street outside, and as it passes Thao's house, gang members discharge a couple of MAC-10 machine guns into the building. Hearing the noise, Walt leaps up and takes his Colt out of a drawer as bullets rip through Thao's house. Walt runs out onto his porch as the Honda speeds away, watches it go, then runs down off the porch and dashes into Thao's house. He runs into the living room where Thao is picking himself up, having a minor neck injury. She comes downstairs, and Thao makes a call, turns to a grim-faced Walt, and shakes his head, then begins to sob. Walt sits with Thao and his mother in their kitchen, sipping a rice liquor. Grandma sees a car go by outside and hurries to the door as everyone follows. Sue comes in with her face a bleeding mass of contusions. Watching, Walt drops his glass. Sue is helped to a chair by her mother and Grandma, blood running down her face and legs. Thao clings to his mother and sobs. Appalled, Walt stares at Sue, his mouth hanging open. He walks away from Thao's house, pushing the Colt into his belt, and walks into his kitchen, leaning against a worktop.",
    "756": "David reaches for it, loses it, sees it again, and at the third attempt, grasps it. Above the pole, bright lights shine into the pool. David struggles to the surface, clinging to the pole, lets go of it to claw his fingers over the pool edge. The pole slides away, and David hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water and crawling painfully slowly away from it. The two children are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him. The pole is lying on the ground between them. David stands and looks at them. Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, bound tightly by twists of wire. Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face. David closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand. The man tears at the choking arm, and slams David back into the bedroom wall. David's back leaves a dent in the plaster wall. The man tries to throw him off, but David squeezes his throat relentlessly. The man jabs him viciously in the ribs with his elbow, lifts him again, but can't escape the arm across his throat. He staggers across the room, lifting and twisting David, still trying to throw him off. They reel across the room and he smashes David into the wall again. He thrashes about, pulling desperately at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before falling forward onto his knees. He rises off balance and David drags him back down. He sinks to the floor and David tightens his grip yanking against the man's neck. David throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless. David crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists. When they are free, her arms flop down. David steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting. He stands over her, still in his cape, gazing down at her. David gently opens a closet door. Audrey's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried from the shadowy light of her room to the foot of the stairs. She opens her eyes in the brighter light of the hall, and lifts her head as David carries her up the staircase. She watches him, smiling very faintly, her long, fair hair falling back from her white forehead, and the light making a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as she stares steadily up at him. He carries her along the landing and into the bedroom, where he lays her softly on the bed.",
    "606": "He closes the cabinet again. He opens the door a third time. The apple has returned. A large bite has been taken out. At the party, Harry has his photograph taken with Slughorn. Harry turns, and wearing a waiter's jacket, Neville walks away. Harry spots Hermione slipping into a curtain and pulls back the silk drapes to join her. She scuttles away as Cormac comes through the drapes. Snape opens the curtains, and Cormac throws up at his feet. Snape glares at him and walks away. Filch manhandles Draco into the room, and Draco glares at Snape. In a dark corridor, Snape has Draco pinned against a wall, and Harry overhears them from an adjoining corridor. The Hogwarts Express plows through snow-covered countryside. She breathes on the glass then draws, with her finger, the shape of a heart with an arrow through it. She looks lovingly at Ron, whose expression glazes over. She breathes on her love heart, then whispers through the closed door. Ron looks up as Hermione comes to the door. She sees the love heart, and Ron looks confused. They both look up at the fading love heart. Christmas at the Weasleys'. Nymphadora Tonks indicates to Harry to remain quiet. Tonks walks away, and Remus Lupin follows her, leaving Harry with Mr. Weasley. Ginny sits beside Harry with a plate of dainty mince pies. Mr. Weasley goes. She holds out a pie, and he takes a bite from the pie she's holding. Ron plunks down between them with a plate of bigger mince pies. Looking awkward, he turns to Harry and holds out the plate. Ron takes one and bites into it. Harry's with Mr. Weasley in his shed, and Harry looks at him thoughtfully. Later, the front door of the house opens, and Remus walks out, followed by Tonks. Remus looks out into the night, and Tonks steps forward with a concerned expression. Wearing a pink dressing gown, Ginny finds Harry sitting on the stairs. He stands up. She bends down and fastens the lace on his trainer. Ginny rises, and they stand close to each other. They lean closer. A ball of fire hurtles to the ground, creating a flaming circle around the house. In a swirl of black, Bellatrix appears. Harry races out of the house. She laughs and sprints away. Harry dashes through a gap in the flames, which closes, preventing Remus from giving chase. Tonks tries to control the flames with her wand. Ginny runs out and leaps through the flames. Harry chases Bellatrix through the tall reeds, with Ginny following. Harry stands still, surrounded by the swaying reeds. Hearing something, he starts to run again. Ginny is a little way behind. She ploughs through the undergrowth, ending up ankle-deep in water. She hears movement and steps back as a figure emerges from the reeds.",
    "758": "David's eyes open, and outside, the greenery is becoming a blur as the train is moving faster and shaking more than it did. He watches through the window and glances across the aisle at a man reading a book, who closes it and, like the woman beside him, begins to stare out of the window as the train shakes more violently. David looks up ahead and sees another passenger's hand reaching down to grab hold of an armrest. A car is driving down a quiet urban street, and in a living room, a boy lies over a sofa, his feet over the back, his head hanging down to the floor, flicking through TV channels with the remote, upside down. David slowly swings his legs over the side of a hospital trolley and sits up, and in front of him, a white bandaged figure is lying on another trolley. Dressed only in his shirt and trousers, David looks around uncertainly as a white-coated man carrying a clipboard, who has been standing by the other figure, walks towards David and is replaced by other medical staff. The man holds up a torch and examines David's eyes. David stares at the other trolley, and they both look at the person on the other trolley, whose chest is heaving unevenly. Still staring at the other figure, David slowly shakes his head and shakes his head again, watching a crimson stain slowly seeping through the bandages of the other passenger. David nods abstractedly as the crimson stain quickly spreads, and the other body heaves as blood forms a pool on top of the bandages. David walks stiffly down a hospital corridor lined with silent people standing, sitting, leaning against walls, many of them watching him and smiling. His son sees him, jumps up from the bench, and runs to him. David hugs his son to his chest, gives him a slight smile, and looks over his head at the slim fair-haired woman who has followed the boy. They stare at each other, and she moves forward and puts her head on his shoulder, his cheek against her hair. He puts his arm around her, gazing past her. She steps back, looks at David, then at the boy, her head on one side. The boy's lips move, and the three of them stand silently for a moment. Then the boy takes the woman's hand and puts it in his father's before setting off down the corridor. As his parents follow, they let go of each other's hands. A gaggle of reporters and photographers, one holding a long boom microphone, are standing inside the big double doors at the end of the corridor, and flashlights go off as David's family steps out into the open air.",
    "998": "The doctor walks over to him as he lays down the open book, and Nick stares at the silver pencil resting on the blank page. In his room, Nick starts to write while men stand on hills of coal waste, hacking away with pickaxes in a filthy industrial area. Nick is on a packed train with Tom when the train stops, and they jump from the train and run off. Tom leads Nick to a garage where she eyes Tom and smiles as Tom slips her some money, pointing at Nick. Myrtle eyes Nick, making him look nervous. Nick sits in Myrtle's apartment in town, watching her little dog eat leftovers off a plate in the extremely gaudy living room with red walls and furnishings and chintzy flower prints everywhere. Nick sits on the edge of the couch, glancing at the ceiling, frowning at the sound of Tom and Myrtle upstairs, and tentatively walks to the door. He puts on his straw boater and opens the door to find a sexy, young woman wearing lots of dark eye shadow and a green dress leaning on the door frame as Myrtle appears, weakening Nick, who smiles. Tom picks him up, while Catherine drapes herself around Nick in a chair, pops a pill in her mouth, and plants a kiss on Nick, transferring the pill into his mouth. In a clinch with Myrtle, Tom watches as Catherine guides Nick's glass to his lips and cocks an eyebrow at him. Tom dances with Myrtle, and Nick dances with Catherine as Chester takes pictures. Tom opens champagne and whacks Nick with a pillow, causing feathers to go everywhere, while a guy plays trumpet on a fire escape, and Tom picks Nick up and twirls him around. Catherine kisses Nick and pulls his shirt off as the girls strip down to their underwear and everyone's dancing. Nick sits watching woozily with Catherine slumped against him, and Myrtle wiggles her hips, pulls her red dress off her shoulder, and holds her arms in the air. Nick sits, drugged, as another version of himself pops a champagne cork, shakes the bottle, fizzing the champagne up, and pours some into his wide-open mouth. Tom pours champagne into the seated Nick's mouth from a ceramic goblet as Nick sways on the spot with glazed, drunken eyes, and his exuberant self rolls about on a bed with Catherine. The woozy Nick goes to a window and looks across at other apartments as a young black woman leans on her window ledge, looking out. He sees himself standing in the street, looking up, and his street self walks off as scenes play out in windows. Nick finds Chester sleeping and wipes cream off his face as Myrtle marches in, followed by Tom, who gives Myrtle a vicious backhander across the face. Nick retreats onto the fire escape as the city recedes.",
    "1322": "Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges past Charlie and out into hell. With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. In the minivan, Audrey screams as the windows begin to crack. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever, and points it at the minivan. The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him, and that's when he starts spraying gas at them. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and blam! blam! blam! The spray of gas explodes into a spray of fire! The minivan is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows explode, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire-rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face circled. Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink and fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher as the boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy. She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf and swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the knife is driven down. Clang! The knife hits the pan hard and stops, but the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife clatters to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his thumbs are missing. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. Charlie shakes her head no. Jeep's light catches something on the ground. Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck. Michael lowers his flashlight. A flickering light emanates from within the diner. Charlie, drenched in sweat, is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs. Bob and Jeep keep watch. The spectral lights in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer. Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder.",
    "666": "Next morning, using a can of Dr. Pepper as a target, Peter is busy fine-tuning his wrist webbing. He pulls it and then catches it, but he's not so lucky with the bed lamp. Peter closes the partly open door and turns around to find his room with spider's web dangling from wall to wall. Meanwhile, Norman Osborn is reading the Daily Bugle; the devils in his mind cause him to close his eyes tightly, and he shakes his head wearily. Uncle Ben gives an OK sign to Aunt May as Peter walks out of the door. Downtown, the four-door automobile pulls up at the curb, and Peter looks away as a look of pain creases Uncle Ben's face. Uncle Ben nods slightly, and a somber Peter again looks away from his uncle. Uncle Ben, with a grim face, gets ready to move off, and Peter clambers out of the car, standing in the middle of the road with a brown paper bag in his hand. He starts to cross the road and watches as his uncle makes a left turn out of sight; then he walks off away from the library. Peter makes his way up a stairway at the wrestling arena and from the balcony watches as Bone Saw McGraw, the master of disaster, slams an opponent on the floor and then jumps on him, leading with an arm to his throat. The large, long-haired, muscle man takes the plaudits, as fans rub big toy saws over their arms, being massaged by four leather-clad beauties. Peter joins the queue, and Bone Saw hauls his opponent out of the ring and grabs the mic. Peter bolts, then slips through the ropes. The crowd chants hostility as the cage is set up above the wrestling ring, and Peter, wearing the spider and web emblazoned on his sweatshirt, looks up as the cage is slowly lowered around the ring, trapping him in. Bone Saw charges as Peter leaps in the air and Bone Saw crashes into the cage. Bone Saw jumps up, and Peter somersaults out of his way, then uses his web to leap out of reach. Bone Saw is handed a folding chair, crashing it twice over Peter's head, and then thuds it across Peter's back. Grabbing Peter by a leg, Bone Saw crashes the youth into the cage bars, and then Bone Saw's handed a golf club. As the big wrestler charges, Peter, on his back on the floor, lashes out with his right foot into Bone Saw's body and face. Bone Saw comes again, and Peter uses both feet to propel the big man under the ropes. Bone Saw collapses to the floor, and Peter's eyes sparkle through the eye-holes of his balaclava as he listens to the crowd.",
    "402": "Dil is looking at Fergus, who blushes and buries himself in his drink, but throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face turned away but sees him in the mirror and eyes him. The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus, who is about to talk when she pipes up. The barman mixes it while she stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink, and a burly man sits down beside her. She slaps the hand away, turns back to Fergus, and finds his seat empty. Fergus is standing across the road from the pub, sweating. Dil comes out of the pub, looks this way and that, searching for Fergus, who stands back into a shadow. Dave, the burly man, comes out, grabs her by the elbow, and she walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again, and they walk with him holding Dil by the arm through a dilapidated street full of squats. They stop outside a door; Dil opens it with a key from her purse, and they both walk inside. Fergus stands there, observing. A light comes on in an upstairs room, and Dil enters, with her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse, and she stands absolutely still as he does so. Fergus is in bed, and we see Jody as a bowler, running in slow motion, toward the camera. Jody releases the ball, and we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily. Fergus takes a break, watches the batsman hit a ball, and imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a voice interrupts him, and Fergus turns to see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is, and beside him is Franknum, the cockney foreman. Fergus resumes work, and it is now crowded with people, black, white, punky, and street chic, a lot of leather, with all the women heavily made-up. From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar. Col, the barman, sees him and smiles, pushing a colored cocktail with a Japanese umbrella toward him. Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts. Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way, so Fergus takes out the umbrella, holds it in one hand, and drinks with the other.",
    "428": "In the silence of the room, they bend over their cues and softly stroke out their shots. The balls roll down the table, bank off the far shoulder, and slowly return toward the two players. Fats' ball hits the closer shoulder. The balls are returned and Eddie makes his break shot, a glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table. Eddie looks up, with a smile. Fats walks around the table and peers at the balls. Placing his cigarette on the wooden rim of the table, Fats rams the cue ball into the pack, dropping the six ball into the pocket. The table is now his. Eddie sits down unhappily. Fats plays quickly, moving from shot to shot with studied authority, his eyes and hands working fluidly together. The shot goes in. As Eddie watches, the prancing, elegant Fats maneuvers around the table. The shot goes in. We see Fats' bejeweled fingers curl around the cue stick, the stick then darting out to send a ball caroming off a far bank and into a side pocket. Fats keeps sinking shots. It is eleven o'clock. Eddie is up. The crowd at Ames sits stolidly in their seats, watching each player, each move. The shot goes in and he lines up another. The shot is a difficult one involving a combination of balls. As it rolls in, the crowd breaks into applause, and Fats bangs the butt of his cue stick on the floor to show his appreciation. So Eddie does the same. Fats peers at the pack of balls huddled together, then points to one that lies in the middle of the pack. Big John looks around — the shot seems impossible. Fats slams the cue ball into the pack. The balls carom outward in all directions. Only the seven rolls slowly into the corner pocket. Eddie slumps back in his seat as the crowd applauds. It is twelve o'clock, and Fats dominates the play. As he calls out the litany of his shots, we see, superimposed over his hands and his face and the sound of socking pool balls, the spectators, stupefied by the action; Charlie, swallowing hard; Eddie, looking on, waiting to play; and the bills endlessly unfolding out of Charlie's hands and floating onto the table. One-thirty and Fats is still shooting. The shot rolls in. The shot goes in. Fats pounds his stick on the floor. Fats allows a perfunctory bow of his head, a courtly gesture, to Eddie's manager. Charlie looks away, avoiding his eyes. Now it's Eddie's voice we hear calling out the shots. He circles the table, a proud, cocky smile on his face, and superimposed over his movements we see the spectators, hunched up in their chairs, and Fats' face, glowering, hostile.",
    "272": "Nathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper, muttering, when Florence enters. As Nathan gets into the driver's seat, he hands her the infant and then a copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Hi nods as he pulls away from the curb, and Ed suddenly bursts out crying. The lights are thrown on, revealing a room hung with streamers. Ed enters with Nathan Jr., and he reaches for the child, takes the baby in both hands, and holds him out at arm's length, pointing him at various places of interest. The baby looks goggle-eyed at each one. Impatient with the nonsense, he props Nathan Jr. up in the corner of the couch, while Hi sits at the other corner and Ed sits in a facing chair. Hi beams at Nathan Jr., Ed smiles at him, and Nathan Jr. looks from one to the other, deadpan, as they seem to be waiting for him to contribute to the conversation. Suddenly, Hi slaps his knee as Ed gets up, picks up the baby, and he frantically reaches for a Polaroid camera. She sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr. as Hi starts screwing the camera into a tripod, adjusting absently, peering through the lens, and as she complies, Hi sits on the couch, holding the camera's cable release. He puts his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera, while Ed nestles her head against Hi's shoulder, talking through his teeth as he continues to grin at the camera. Meanwhile, two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended at a gas island with a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank. As Gale starts up the car, Evelle yanks the hose out and drops it to the ground, with Gale already starting to peel out as Evelle gets in. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room, in a pool of lamp light. By the time the camera tightens on his face, the knocking has become quite loud, and he looks up, alarmed, at the front door of the trailer, where someone is pounding insistently. He sits up and tenses, looks around, squinting at Hi as she hisses. As Ed turns back to the bedroom and enters, shutting the door, she listens hard at the door to Hi's footsteps crossing the living room, the click of the door opening, followed by silence, and then a burst of raucous male laughter as Gale roars with laughter. Ed smiles politely and then squints at Hi, while Gale admires the baby, and Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably. Hi clears his throat while Gale stares at the streamers and decorations, reading aloud, as Hi and Ed respond simultaneously.",
    "1179": "In the middle of the night, a stormy sea lashes a small rocky island. In a lonely building, a stone hut, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are fast asleep in a big double bed, and in the room below, Dudley is asleep on a sofa while Harry sprawls on the floor in a sleeping bag. He adds some candles and glances at the watch on Dudley's wrist. It's midnight. He blows the candles, and a flash of lightning causes Dudley to wake with a start. The heavy wooden door shudders, and Harry hides in a corner as the Dursleys appear on the stairs, with Vernon waving a shotgun nervously. The door falls into the room, and a huge figure looms in the doorway. He steps inside, tucking his pink umbrella into his coat, and fits the door back into the frame. Hagrid bends the shotgun barrel, which fires into the rafters. Harry steps forward, takes a large cake box from his pocket as Hagrid sits down, and points his umbrella at the fireplace to light the fire, terrifying the Dursleys. Harry puts down the cake and looks at the giant curiously as Hagrid smiles knowingly, takes out a letter with a wax seal, and gives it to Harry, who opens the envelope and reads the green writing. Spotting Dudley scuffing Harry's cake, Hagrid points his umbrella and gives him a curly pig's tail, causing the Dursleys to shriek with horror, but Harry laughs with delight. Hagrid throws open the door and goes out, followed by Harry after hesitating for only a moment. In a busy street in London, Harry reads from a list as Hagrid takes him into the Leaky Cauldron Public House. The Smokey Pub is lit with candles, and Harry looks around at the people dressed in old-fashioned clothes. The barman spots them, and everyone turns and looks, with people shaking Harry's hand. A man in a turban is present as they go out into the backyard, where Hagrid taps his umbrella all around a small metal grill. To Harry's surprise, the bricks in the wall start to move, rearranging themselves to form a doorway. Harry steps through the doorway into a strange new world. Diagon Alley is a narrow, crooked lane hustling with witches and wizards in flowing cloaks and pointed hats. Hagrid towers over them all as they pass tiny shops packed full of fascinating and unusual merchandise, including a selection of wizard's cloaks and hats and a pet shop full of owls and cages. An owl sits on a perch outside the shop, and a bat stretches its wings above Harry's head. A group of children gaze enviously at a sleek broomstick in a shop window, and Harry looks worried as all the clerks in Gringotts Bank are creepy little men with long noses and sharp pointed ears and teeth.",
    "185": "Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them. The two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small suburban home. Annie walks up to her door. For a moment Laurie looks around cautiously before searching down the sidewalk again, with the camera tracking with her. Again she turns around and glances back down the street. Suddenly, Laurie walks right into a man standing on the sidewalk in front of her. She screams and drops her books. It is Lee Brackett, Annie's father, a tall man in a county sheriff's uniform. Laurie bundles her books and hurries up the street as Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house, pauses a moment, and glances down the street. Several children in costumes are going door to door collecting their treats. She slams the receiver down. Almost immediately, the phone rings again. Laurie looks at it and picks it up. The camera begins on the trees that line the residential street, twisting and writhing in the dusk wind. Laurie carries a tote bag with schoolbooks and knitting needles inside, and a large pumpkin. The sun is a pale glow behind the trees. Slowly, the camera booms down to Laurie waiting outside her house by the street. Laurie turns her gaze down the street, where more children in costumes walk from house to house, some with mothers and sisters, trick or treating. The wind blows their costumes, billowing them outward. She watches the trick-or-treaters as a car swings around the corner and pulls up in front of her. There is a wide shot of an old graveyard on a windy hillside. The camera booms down as a car pulls up on the small road in the foreground. Sam Loomis gets out, along with Taylor, the graveyard owner. He glances at a small notepad. The two men begin walking along the graveyard, winding around headstones and flowers. Taylor stops cold and points to a plot right in front of them. Taylor gives Loomis a quizzical look as Loomis stares. The headstone is missing, uprooted from the ground. Loomis shakes his head and looks across the graveyard. Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots. Behind them, through the rear-view mirror, we see Loomis' station wagon pull out of an alley and follow along. Annie points up ahead and quickly hides the joint as Annie's car drives through the main square of Haddonfield, with the station wagon following behind. Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols Hardware Store. Annie's car stops at the police cars. They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing out the marijuana smoke. Lee Brackett strolls out to the car and leans down to the window.",
    "700": "Peter frees himself and punctures Venom. They fall off the web and plummet down the side of the skyscraper, trading kicks and blows as they descend the lift shaft. Peter tries to pull his mask back on but drops it, managing to fire a thread just before hitting the ground. He lands in a deserted construction site, his suit ripped and torn. He retrieves his mask and looks up sharply as the truck starts dropping towards the cab. Mary Jane leaps out of the cab just before the truck hits it and clings to the web. The sandy ground shakes, knocking Spider-Man over, and Sandman rises from a moving mountain of sand, towering over the cowering crowd like a colossus. The crowd scatters as Sandman's massive fist slams into the ground, narrowly missing Spider-Man, who looks up at Mary Jane clinging to the web. Spider-Man dodges Sandman's truck-sized foot, whizzing past the giant on threads while Sandman swats at him. Mary Jane loses her grip, landing on the lower section of webs exposed like a sacrificial victim, watching Spider-Man hurtling towards her. Venom leaps out at Spider-Man, knocking him into a column of girders that he bounces against as he falls. He lands on a horizontal girder and turns to face Sandman, who towers over him. Venom, standing beneath the girder, fires a thread down Spider-Man's neck and pulls him onto his back, garroting him as Sandman prepares to smash him. Spider-Man desperately reaches out a hand to free himself. The web holding the cab above Mary Jane starts to break as Spider-Man is pummeled by Sandman's fist, his mask torn. Peter stretches out his hand towards Mary Jane, who looks down helplessly as Sandman smashes his fist down on Peter, whose hand hangs limply at his side. Sandman rears up for another blow, but a pumpkin bomb is fired into the side of his head, blowing half of it away and leaving the rest looking like burning coals. A searchlight reveals the new goblin gliding through the air on his sky stick. He sends Venom flying through some walls with a flick of his sky stick. With his mask peeling back to reveal Harry's disfigured face, he glides alongside the battered Peter.",
    "437": "Don enters the chaotic living room, where the telephone on the desk is the only thing seemingly alive. Although he appears to be heading straight to the ringing phone, he is actually drawn to the bottle and the glass by the big chair. He moves slowly toward them, picks up the bottle, and holds it upside down over the glass. The room is in disorder, with books on the floor, a table on a chair under the ceiling fixture, the couch moved from the wall, and clothes and shoes spilled from the closet. Two empty bottles and a sticky glass are about, while a typewriter with a nearly blank sheet of paper sits on the desk. Don goes to the glass and holds two bottles upside down over it, yielding only one slow drop, followed by two more that barely stain the bottom of the glass. He puts down the bottles and empties the meager drops into his throat. Assessing his finances, Don quickly checks his pockets and finds exactly two cents in his palm. Looking around, he notices the typewriter and moves toward it, ripping the sheet of paper from the roller, slamming the lid shut, and picking it up. He drags it to the hallway, puts on his hat, carefully steps over two newspapers and bottles of milk, closes the door, and starts down the stairs, where a note from Helen remains pinned to the door. Exiting the house with the typewriter, he encounters a steel gate blocking the entrance and stands mystified. Nearby, a woman with a baby carriage stands, staring intrusively. Don, feeling pressured by her gaze, straightens up and heads toward another pawn shop, a distant goal given his condition. Each step is painful, and the thunderous noise of the elevated railway above is excruciating. He leans against a pillar, shaking, and waits for a trolley car to pass before continuing across the street to the second pawn shop, only to find it closed as well. Frustrated, he shakes a bar and peers through the iron gate into the dark shop. Seeing another pawn shop across the street, he sweats profusely as two men stand grinning nearby. Finally, discouraged, he picks up the typewriter and starts walking back.",
    "589": "He reads the letter using the light from a nearby window and then picks up the bottle, throwing it hard across the room, which explodes against the hanging photo of his son, staring at it motionless. Rain falls steadily as Whip sits in the car, pouring alcohol into a bottle of juice and taking a drink, before exiting the car and entering a large hangar where the crashed South Jet Aircraft stands almost completely assembled with parts strewn around beside it, alongside cabinets and shelves lining one side of the building. Hugh follows Charlie out of the plane as Whip cocks his head, then Hugh turns and walks away. Whip speeds down the mud road, splashing slush to the side and brakes when he sees news crews outside the farmhouse. Some reporters spot him, so he reverses and drives back onto the main road, stopping opposite a house in a quiet neighborhood, pulling up on a curb barely missing a fire hydrant and chugs on the bottle of juice. He steps out of the car and walks up a footpath to a house where a man watches him from a parked car, speaking into his cell phone. Whip's ex-wife opens the door, but her smile fades as Whip hugs the struggling Will and turns off the news. Whip lifts his arms and walks down a hotel corridor with Charlie holding a can of Coca-cola, approaching a burly man. Hugh emerges from a room, and Whip enters the room where they shake hands and hug. Whip looks around the spacious room, picks up a can of Coke, and goes over to the fridge, finding it stocked with juices and nonalcoholic beverages. Later, he eats a meal alone in his room, lies in bed surfing channels on the TV, shaves, then tries to open the thick file Hugh left for him, which spreads like an accordion, and he abandons it. He sits over the toilet smoking as the bath fills, and the clock shows 2.08 AM as he hangs a suit in a wardrobe. He looks around for the source of the knocking and, lying in bed, he's awakened by the same sound. He gets out of bed, goes to a side door, holds his ear to it, then pulls it open, revealing the extended lock on a door leading to an adjoining room bumping repeatedly against the doorjamb. Whip enters the room, feeling a gentle breeze blow through the balcony doors ruffling drawn curtains. He walks over, gazes at the skyline, and sees a plane's beacon lights flash in the night sky. Whip turns around, and his eyes fall on a fridge. He opens the door to reveal rows of miniature bottles of alcohol on the shelves.",
    "724": "Cal steps on a piece of broken banister and falls. He stands, picks up the gun, and runs after them. Jack and Rose run to the bottom of the staircase. Cal aims but doesn't fire. He knocks a man out of his way, then shoots again. Jack and Rose run down another staircase, then jump into waist-high water. Cal runs into the water. Jack and Rose hurry into the dining room. Cal aims, but the gun is empty. Cal looks around himself at the rising water. Jack and Rose run through the dining room. Cal climbs several steps, then stops. He chuckles to himself as Lovejoy appears. Rose and Jack run down a passageway. They turn, then run down more stairs. Stopping, Jack presses his finger to his mouth. In the dining room, a glass door swings slowly through the water. Small waves push plates and silverware, as rising water covers the tables and chairs. Rose and Jack step into another passageway. At the far end, a small boy stands against a wall. Water pours down the steps, and then they run towards the boy. Sparks shoot from an overhead pipe. Jack picks up the boy, then watches as water shoots in from cracks. They turn and run back up the passageway. They stop as water rushes into the passageway ahead of them. As they run in the opposite direction, a man, the boy's father, steps into the hall. The man grabs the boy from Jack, then knocks Jack against a wall. The man runs off with the boy, and Jack and Rose run after him. The man picks up a suitcase, then gapes at the door, which bursts. Water rushes in, knocking the man over. Water rushes after them as they run down the passageway. A wave knocks them over, and rushing water carries them away. Water pours around them as lights flicker. Jack struggles against the current toward a stairwell. They pull themselves along a wall toward the stairwell. Jack pushes Rose through the shoulder-high water toward the railing. Rose grabs the railings and climbs to another locked gate. Jack shakes the gate as the water rises below them. The water reaches their feet. A steward runs past them. The steward returns for them. He tries several keys in the lock, as water swirls around them. The water reaches their thighs. Sparks shoot nearby. The steward fumbles with the keys and then drops underwater. Holding onto the grate with one hand, he reaches for the keys. Jack grabs the keys, then resurfaces. Jack reaches around the grate with the key, but misses the lock. He slips the key into the lock. He turns the key. Rose opens the gate.",
    "133": "Gandhi is staring at the street, and from his point of view, we hold on a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari, with another hollow-faced child leaning against her. A splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, lords it on a velvet lawn while a woman in a sumptuous silk sari tries to feed it crumbs. Behind her, Gandhi's reception is in full spate with silver trays, tables covered in fine linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, and the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South Africa. A beautiful and beautifully dressed woman, Mrs. Nehru, stands next to her distinguished husband, Motilal Nehru, and she nods lightly toward Nehru. Nehru is introducing Gandhi to two men, one tall, slender, and ascetic-looking but dressed impeccably, Jinnah, and the other with a haunting face, beard, flowing dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical, Prakash, whom we recognize from the opening sequence in Delhi at Gandhi's assassination. Gandhi bows to Jinnah and then looks a little startled at Prakash, who grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi. Gandhi nods and meets Prakash's gaze firmly, showing the first moment of the Gandhi of South Africa. Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to the others, and Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop in full clerical robes. Behind him, we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society, and as Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru, and Prakash watch him clinically. Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian male not in European clothes. Gokhale is pleased, and Gandhi is amused, sharing another grin. Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently and penetratingly, and although brusque, it is affectionate; we know he regards Charlie as Gandhi does. While Gokhale hasn't smiled, Gandhi and Charlie have, in a private, beautiful, and still moment. Gandhi walks along slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale, grinning self-deprecatingly, but Gokhale persists, pausing to look at Gandhi, and for the first time, he smiles. When he speaks, his voice is thick with feeling, his eyes watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi rigidly. Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach, as Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, with another member of the party next to her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach, while he writes in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches, and outside, a broad alluvial plain stretches, with the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun.",
    "311": "Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan when suddenly a foot reaches out and trips him. Tommy falls to the floor, and the crowd cackles at him. He slowly gets up and locks eyes with Evan, who looks guilty and weakly shakes his head as if to say it's not what Tommy is thinking. Tommy suddenly lunges at a Teen Punk, who is at least a foot taller than he is, and lands a flurry of punches before the Teen Punk can defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan. Evan, Kayleigh, and the punk's friends look on helplessly when two security guards seize Tommy. As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan with a sick smile on his face, while Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless. Andrea drives through the winding roads, her eyes tormented, revealing she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan is up front, and Kayleigh sits behind them, and everyone is silent. Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car, discreetly watched by Evan through the window, while Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house. As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes, and the station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Lenny looks back at the model airplane as Evan, Lenny, and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods. As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing on the horizon, and they run toward the smoke with Lenny nervously following behind. They exit the woods to find Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid next to a campfire. Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog, but Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank, and swings at Evan, who ducks back at the last minute, causing Tommy to accidentally connect with Kayleigh's head, knocking her unconscious. Enraged, Tommy fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's kneecap, bashing him and causing Evan to double over in pain and fall to the ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, where Crockett squirms inside the bag, and picks up the lighter fluid. Evan painfully looks up from the ground, and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack. Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid-soaked dog. As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and charges Tommy at full speed. His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, now lying face down on the ground. Evan regains himself, sits up painfully, his face badly bruised, and clutches his battered ribs.",
    "1093": "A thin hollowed cheek man wanders towards them. Both Zus and Tuvia scramble to their feet and point their weapons. Zus runs after Lazar. Tuvia leaves Zus on the ground where he pushed him. The tall stranger addresses him. All eyes are on Tuvia. With his machine gun over his shoulder, he takes a step backwards and surveys the group, his face angry and dismayed. He glances across at Zus, who is skulking by a tree. Everyone turns to young Aron. Tuvia's tough expression weakens, and his thin lips tremble. Zus looks from Aron to Tuvia, waiting for a response. Tuvia tries to compose his face. He steps towards Aron and cradles his head in his arms. Aron wraps his arms around his big brother. Later hiding in some woodland with Zus and Benzion by his side, Tuvia appears through binoculars at Koscik's farmhouse. The three of them step towards it. Koscik's wife is in the garden hanging up washing. The three partisans armed with rifles come past a flock of geese on their way to the barn. Nearing the door, they stop as a pair of legs comes into view. Koscik is hanging from a rafter, with a wooden sign around his neck. Zus bangs a cross into the ground. Tuvia, holding a shovel, steps away from Koscik's newly dug grave. Her long, black skirt trailing on the ground, she leads the three men to a haystack where Tuvia and Zus open the trapdoor. They peer down into a shelter and smile. The brothers help Asael out into the sunshine. Zus gives him a bear hug. Rifles. Two women climbed, one a teenager, the other in her 30s. Zus leads Bella and Chaya away. Tuvia thanks Koscik's widow. He runs after the others. At the camp, Shimon and Malvin are shoving earth. The intellectuals shrug and get on with their digging. Asael is intently looking at the blond teenager. Tuvia gives Chaya a friendly wave. Asael strolls down to Chaya and Tuvia cracks a rare smile. An elderly Russian in a horse-drawn cart trundles along the dirt track. Zus with his machine gun steps out in front of him. Asael and Ben Zion step out. Zus smiles doubtfully. Later, wearing the man's coat and carrying two churns, Zus leads the way back through the woods. A man approaches Chaya. At dusk, Benzion comes up to Tuvia who is sitting by a fire, reading. Tuvia's rugged face stiffens. Benzion nods respectfully and leaves Tuvia alone. A young boy plays the violin. People in the camp sit quietly, sadness and loss etched on their faces. Asael watches Chaya from a distance. At the bottom of a leaf-strewn slope, Tuvia stands alone by a stream, grieving.",
    "332": "The strange tower of Orthanc, hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian, rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs and sweeps down them. Gandalf moves quickly towards Saruman, grimy and weary from his long ride. Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of Isengard, with Saruman's clean, white robe contrasting with Gandalf's dusty grey robes. Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere-like shape is draped with a cloth. Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir and then sits upon his throne. Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door, horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman, a look of dawning horror on his face. At that moment, Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room and slams against the wall, pinned there by some unseen force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff at Saruman, blasting him off his feet, and Gandalf and Saruman battle, with powerful blasts throwing them across the room. Saruman screams, eyes blazing, as Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp and flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand, and Gandalf is flung to the floor. Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes looking into the madness of Saruman. Commanding two staffs, Saruman sends Gandalf into a sickening spin, and Gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber as if falling in reverse. The roof of Orthanc rockets toward the camera. Meanwhile, Frodo and Sam are walking along a country lane which borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up as Frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. Suddenly, a figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow, sending Frodo flying. Merry, Pippin, and Frodo pick themselves up and a variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the hedgerow, with angry shouts from Farmer Maggot. Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away with Frodo and Sam on their heels. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. A winded Pippin finds his face inches away from a large pile of horse droppings, and he pulls a large carrot, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road: small, brown mushrooms growing amongst the loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms as Frodo remains tense and watchful. Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly, realizing they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air, whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind.",
    "496": "Tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter, and we see that the statue Cole stole from the church is in here. This tent is a sanctuary made by an eight-year-old to hide in. Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals, and Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey. The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted drawings and test papers. Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall, continuing in silence, as Malcolm takes his time. Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall and realizes Cole is no longer next to him. Malcolm turns to find Cole frozen about ten feet back and walks to him, noticing Cole's expression as he gets closer. Climbing ropes hang from the wood-beamed ceiling, and Malcolm looks to Cole, then turns back to the ceiling. Malcolm's body becomes very still as he looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes, glancing at Cole, then turning back to him, finding the child with tears in his eyes. Cole looks at Malcolm desperately, and Malcolm stares helplessly. A black man in britches and no shirt, with his face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center, a white woman in a torn white frilly dress with tears soaking her face hangs to the right, and a small mixed race child in half pants hangs to their left; the family stares at Cole. Lynn fiddles with the dials, while Cole is standing before the beat-up twelve-inch kitchen TV. On the television screen is Tommy Tammisimo, standing in his pajamas in a doorway. Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his plate, then moves them to the floor. Lynn is irritated, as this is a sore point between them. Lynn and Cole eat quietly as Cole looks up with an anxious expression on his face, just staring, then looking down at his lap. Lynn stares at Cole, folding her napkin quietly, as Cole's eyes start to water up, just staring at his mother's expression. Cole gets up, never taking his eyes off his mother, and leaves the room, entering the dark hallway. He gets startled by the sound, as Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole. Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a couch, then slowly turns back and looks down the hall. The door to Cole's room sits at the end of the corridor, and Cole stops breathing, too terrified to move. Meanwhile, Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy out of the broom closet, fighting back some tears, and eventually hugs him.",
    "32": "He nods approval to Abdul, then a German appears in the doorway. Abdul starts to close the door on the man, who tries to push his way through as Rick walks up. Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his hand, and tears it up. At this moment, Ugarte, a small, thin man with a nervous air, tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. He gets through and passes Rick. The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into the air behind him. Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table. If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout. Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs, then pulls out a chair at Rick's table and sits down. A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks, placing one before Ugarte. He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table. Rick appears ready to take them from Ugarte, and he does so. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter comes up, starts across the floor, but stops as Rick comes up to him. Ugarte hesitates for a moment, while Rick looks at Ugarte steadily. Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room, which is in semi-darkness. During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano. Ferrari, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing nightspot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam, then sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of the number, Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick, and they walk over to the piano. Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away. Back at the bar, Yvonne, an attractive young French woman, sits on a stool drinking brandy, as Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler. Rick saunters over and leans on the bar next to Yvonne, who has never taken her eyes off him. Rick looks the check over, tears it up, and pays no attention to her. Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him, then looks at him bitterly without saying a word. Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury. Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and signals for a cab, pulling her along toward the door. Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab. Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport as Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this evening's performance. Rick walks over to him.",
    "475": "Constanze curtsies, and he giggles uncomfortably as Cavalieri glares at Mozart, who looks hastily away from her. She attempts to kiss the royal hand but faints instead, causing the Emperor to contemplate her prone body and step back a pace. He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage with his Chamberlain, while Cavalieri, with a savage look at Mozart, leaves the stage the opposite way to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. Salieri watches as Mozart remains indecisive for a second about whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber, but when Constanze catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself, she seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig as Salieri looks astonished. The door opens, Constanze enters, and Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control. The old man speaks passionately to the priest while the young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross, and we see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Leopold, a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier, expresses deepest gratitude by kissing the Archbishop's hand, who then motions Leopold to rise. The camera pulls back to reveal Leopold kneeling beside Constanze, a priest facing them, with Madame Weber, Josefa, and Sophie Weber, and a merry-looking lady in bright clothes, the Baroness, are behind them. Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously, and Salieri smiles at him, but Salieri's face falls almost imperceptibly as a servant enters, and Salieri goes into the salon. Constanze stands closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts, and Salieri enters the salon as Constanze drops him a shy curtsy and shyly unveils. He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table, indicating a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts, which he offers to her. She takes one, puts it in her mouth, and he watches carefully before taking one himself, wearing a heavy gold signet-ring. He smiles at her, and she takes another chestnut, as the old man faces the priest; close up, the manuscript is in Mozart's handwriting. The court composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts with her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when finished, his face agonized and wondering, shuddering as if in a rough and tumbling sea, experiencing the point where beauty and great pain coalesce, while more pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade as he circles the room.",
    "510": "Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful face, as the Execs and Sloss laugh, prompting Holden and Banky to politely join in, though Banky shoots Holden a 'these guys are idiots' look, and Holden smiles. Later, Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs, and upon reaching a swing set, they sit down on the swings. Alyssa holds up her hand, and after swallowing what she's chewing, she releases her tongue, which is just huge, leaving Holden transfixed. Alyssa wraps it back up with a smile and stands, then exits while Holden remains in the swing. Alyssa returns as Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage, while Holden checks his beeper and exits. Banky starts packing his magazines up, and a little kid enters, staring at him before disappearing, leaving Banky standing open-mouthed. They head toward the skee-ball runs, where Holden rolls the ball, landing it in a twenty-point circle. Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and throws it overhand, causing it to pop off one of the circles and shoot back, making them duck. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs, and he ducks again as the ball comes sailing back at his head, then gets up and throws the ball in surprise, causing it to ricochet off the ceiling and smash through the glass of an old pinball machine, while Alyssa laughs. Later, Banky sits there, shocked, puts the controller down, and crosses to the drawing table, where Holden starts drawing as Banky stares at him, then starts drawing something himself. Banky draws a four-way stop, finishes drawing, and illustrates according to his voice-over. Holden shakes his head and storms away, with Banky following. Holden looks at Banky for a long moment as Banky stares back, then suddenly softens and drops his head, looks into Holden's eyes, and walks away, while Holden watches him go and exits. Alyssa picks through her food as she and Holden sit at a booth, then she grabs her bag, slides out of the booth, and heads to the cashier's desk with Holden following, offering a puzzled shrug. Alyssa gestures with a 'just wait' finger when the cashier turns to her, as Holden stares at her, then ahead, swerving the wheel to the right to pull the car to the side of the road, throws it into park, noting the rain is a bit heavier now. Holden stares at Alyssa, and she stares back before getting out of the car. With the rain now pouring, Alyssa starts hitching up the road, and Holden reaches her, with both being drenched. She shakes her head ruefully and walks away, leaving Holden standing there at a loss before he turns and heads back to his car.",
    "1321": "Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light, as headlights appear on the highway. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face and then pulls out his silver 45. The headlights become a family minivan careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps, and Kyle and Audrey aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well-dressed man in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car, looking around nervously, and after seeing the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously inside the car. He races around to the gas pump as Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner, seeing an army of dark shapes swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family as the father lifts the pump, and Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family. Kyle fires his gun in the air, and at the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof, and his family starts to scream to him. The man can only see silhouettes in the light, but he doesn't wait to see if they are friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner. The father dashes to the driver's side but sees a blur of movement rushing at him, and his blood paints the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping them one after another. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them, and finds the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down, gathers the boy into his arms, and moves on to the mother. The creatures have stopped coming at him; instead, they're just standing there watching him. Kyle freezes, sensing something terribly wrong. Audrey raises the 45 and pulls the trigger, but it clicks. She continues pulling the trigger as the boy's tears stop instantly. Audrey backs away and looks toward the entrance to the diner, blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere, and she's trapped. She notices the open door to the minivan, dives into the car, and as the creatures rapidly close in, she hammers the auto door lock. Clunk! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows, a nightmare come to life. Charlie rushes to Michael's side, but he's immovable. Charlie cocks the gun, moves toward the door, and looks back at him defiantly.",
    "16": "Carolyn switches on the bedside light and sinks into a chair, stunned, as it's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change, so he curls up under the covers contentedly. Close on Lester, smiling. We are flying high above the neighborhood, and below we see the two Jims jogging. We approach them steadily and are now at street level, following the two Jims. Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison as Lester runs into frame, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches up, and the three men run together in the early morning light. The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the urine sample in front of him. The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when something catches his eye: Lester and the Jims jog down the street. Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting, then laughs and extends his hand to the Colonel, saluting him good-naturedly, grinning. An awkward beat follows, and then he heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark. Ricky enters, followed by Lester. He gives the urine specimen to Lester, then locks the door. Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it while Ricky crosses to a bureau, opens a drawer, takes clothing out, and piles it on his bed. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a false bottom, revealing rows of marijuana tightly packed in Zip-loc bags. Lester smiles, thinking this kid's cool. Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut roses, passes by the garage window and stops to sniff the air, frowning. She peers through the window and sees Lester, in a T-shirt and gym shorts, lying on a new weight bench, doing bench presses with shiny new barbells. The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary. Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up. He looks up, squinting, as the door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a remote at us. Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the weights, and then she's gone. Elsewhere, Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document as Lester sits across from him, smiling. Brad laughs, stops laughing, then leans back in his chair, studying Lester. Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder, happier than he's been in years.",
    "39": "SYLVIE GAUDET, a French woman in her early thirties, joins REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS from the railing of the sun deck. JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, pleased with the situation. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine, and coffee, as REGGIE starts eating a chicken leg. SYLVIE observes the disarrayed table before following. They pass through a magnificent indoor pool area with ceiling-high windows showing snow-covered mountains, continuing their conversation. An open balcony surrounds the pool with sun-worshippers in deck chairs, and REGGIE and SYLVIE continue their conversation. SYLVIE stops, noticing a strange figure in a grotesque knitted mask covering the face except for the eyes, nose, and mouth. The camera pans down to include JEAN-LOUIS, held by the masked man, and also shows REGGIE and SYLVIE. SYLVIE assesses the situation, stands up, and she and JEAN-LOUIS start to leave, with JEAN-LOUIS squirting PETER with his pistol. The camera shows the Arc de Triomphe at the Avenue's end and pans to a taxi pulling up to a handsome building with REGGIE, SYLVIE, and JEAN-LOUIS inside. REGGIE exits, and the driver begins unloading her suitcases as JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out the window, and REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised. REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver carrying her cases and presses the button to open the front door. As the elevator rises, REGGIE exits, followed by the driver who places the bags in front of the apartment door and leaves. Sighing, REGGIE takes out her keys to unlock the door and enters the empty Salon, with camera following. The room is stripped bare, with patches of original wall color where paintings once hung, hooks still in place. She rushes to the bedroom, camera lurching behind her, finding it too empty. She hastily opens wardrobe closets revealing only hangers, and finds drawers empty as well. REGGIE is in near-shock. We see a large metal drawer being opened, revealing a familiar shape under a damp muslin sheet, as REGGIE, GRANDPIERRE, and an ATTENDANT look into the drawer. GRANDPIERRE lifts the sheet's corner, revealing a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.",
    "241": "Szpilman and Henryk struggle desperately as they begin to walk and continue on their way. They arrive at a wooden bridge constructed to link the small ghetto to the large ghetto, with few people around, mostly beggars and children. As they climb the bridge's stairs, Henryk stumbles and sinks to his knees, but Szpilman helps him stand and supports him towards the back of a cafe where Henryk finishes a bowl of soup and a piece of bread while sitting with Szpilman and Benek. The kitchen is small and busy with cooks, waiters, and washers-up. A dense crowd of people crosses the bridge in both directions. Szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and encounters Jehuda Zyskind with Majorek. They stop but are buffeted by the crowd. Meanwhile, cars, trams, pedestrians, and German guards are in the street below. Schultz, a fat, sweaty German, fills out a form while Majorek stands beside him, chatting and laughing quietly. Szpilman and Father stand in the doorway of a small office on an upper level, overlooking a factory floor where Jewish men and women work at sewing machines, creating a terrible clatter. The name 'Samuel Szpilman' is written on a certificate, which Schultz stamps and hands to Majorek, who gives it to Father. A great mass of agitated people crosses from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their belongings as a German film crew records. They struggle across the bridge, and a truck backs up, revealing a load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets, and bedclothes. Three Jews in the van unload the items, and the Szpilman family, along with others, stands ready to sort them. Szpilman and Henryk sort carpets, Father sorts mirrors, Regina sorts linen, and Halina and Mother sort clothing. They carry the items into a warehouse that resembles an Aladdin's cave, filled with similar objects. The activity continues in a large room separated by an improvised partition of blankets for men and women, with three-tiered bunks. On the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, and Henryk is on the lower. Suddenly, a volley of shots and German voices are heard. Szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it, and comes face to face with a German NCO and soldiers. The NCO hits Szpilman across the face, then turns and leaves.",
    "665": "Peter tries to shoot webs from his wrist but initially nothing happens. On his second attempt, a column of threads flies out, and on the third attempt, the web wraps around the jib of a crane, with Peter holding the other end. He grabs the web with both hands, leaps onto the wall surrounding the roof, takes a quick look down to the street, steadies himself, and jumps. Clinging to the web, he swings through the air like Tarzan and lands on the roof opposite, where he crashes into a wall poster and falls to the ground. Later that evening, Peter races to his aunt and uncle's house, where he sees paint supplies set out and finds a note about dinner. His attention is drawn to an argument at MJ's house, and he takes the garbage out to the backyard, separated from MJ's by a small fence. MJ comes out, stands for a moment, then turns to Peter with her hands in her pockets, looking coy. Peter leans on the fence, and they both react to the sound of Flash's convertible. Peter then looks for cars for sale in the paper, finding various options and prices. He spots an amateur wrestling ad offering $3,000 for three minutes, dreams of MJ and a sports car, and sketches costume ideas, including a cape, utility belt, and a spider symbol. He imagines a spider design with red legs and a blue body, a red checked mask, and adds color with red checks on boots, a blue body stocking, red checks on the head mask, a center strip down the chest, around the waist, and a touch of red along the arm.",
    "218": "The rumble is building and then erupts into a deafening roar as a wall of water crashes through the hollow, engulfing everything and everybody. The cabin itself is ripped away, and the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their feet amid noise and confusion. Suddenly, the world becomes silent as Everett tumbles in the current in natural slow motion, suspended around scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade. Other objects, including framed sepia-tinted family portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, a wild-eyed frantically paddling bloodhound, and a tire with a rope tied around it, spin slowly by. The churning torrent opens into a lowland, becoming a newly created river, fast-moving but no longer violent. After a moment holding on the rippling waters, the surface is broken as a pine coffin up-bobs and floats downstream, soon joined by Everett, who gasps for air, shakes his head clear of water, and finishes freeing himself from the rope round his wrists. Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, also gasping for air, and the men hang onto the coffin that bears them downstream. Dazed, they look around at the inundated valley, where only occasional roof- or treetops poke out of the newly formed river. Everett waxes smug but trails off as he notices a cottonhouse submerged to its eaves with a cow on its roof staring at him, a stare he returns before shaking off the vision and clearing his throat. Downstream, Tommy surfaces, clinging to a half-submerged piece of furniture that begins to rotate in the current, causing him to climb in place like a hamster on a wheel to stay above water. Meanwhile, Everett and Penny walk arm in arm with the seven Wharvey gals behind, the girls singing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk. Everett fumbles in his pocket and shakes his head, prompting Penny to quicken her pace in indignation, and he keeps up as they pull forward out of frame. The Wharvey gals follow in a ragged bunch, still singing, as the second-to-last and oldest girl holds a piece of string that leads our gaze to reveal a train track in the distance. The blind seer pumps his car along the distant track, singing harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.",
    "234": "Three young Poles carry long objects wrapped in newspaper. One man checks his watch, kneels, and places the package he's carrying to his shoulder, revealing the barrel of a machine gun as it begins firing. His two companions do the same, targeting the Schutzpolizei building, hitting the sentry who falls in front of his box. Suddenly, gunfire echoes throughout the city. Pedestrians scatter, except for an old man with a walking stick, who manages to enter a building. Rifle and machine-gun fire erupt from the Schutzpolizei building, and the three young Poles maneuver to a corner opposite it, tossing grenades inside. A battle ensues as the Germans retaliate from the hospital, with grenades and machine-gun fire exchanged. Szpilman watches from his window, noticing smoke rising as a Panzerfaust rocket emerges from a lower window in a neighboring building. It fires, hitting the hospital as the city becomes engulfed in flames. The firing wanes, with sporadic shots and isolated explosions. Szpilman lies on his bed, staring at the ceiling, with the Schutzpolizei building reduced to ashes. A horse-drawn cab rounds the corner, clattering down the street before vanishing from view. Beneath him, a man and woman walk with their hands up, followed by a German soldier with a rifle. As they begin to flee, the woman is shot and collapses awkwardly on the street. Szpilman watches in shock as he hears voices, shouts, and footsteps outside his door. He listens intently, hearing footsteps descend stairs amidst shouts. A German Captain appears, studying Szpilman briefly, nods, and instructs him to follow. Szpilman picks up a tin and follows the Captain through a damaged double door into a room with a broken table that used to be a dining room.",
    "282": "Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair, looking out tensely. The camera moves in until his profile is in big close-up. From Jeff's viewpoint, all the windows and the salesman's apartment are dark. Suddenly, a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar, the flame briefly illuminating his face. The camera now faces Jeff as he talks in a low voice while keeping his eyes on the salesman's apartment; Lisa also speaks quietly. Behind Lisa, Sixth Avenue can be seen while she is on the phone. Jeff continues watching the salesman's apartment, puts the receiver down, and resumes his vigil. As the match dies out, only the glow of the cigar is visible. Jeff talks on the telephone, his eyes still on the neighborhood, as the camera pulls back slightly and Stella emerges from the kitchen with a breakfast tray. She squeezes past Jeff and places the tray on a window seat in front of him, with a touch of urgency in his voice as Stella peers cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment. She then retrieves the table, sets it across Jeff's lap, and places the breakfast tray on it, observing Thorwald's apartment once more. Jeff moves back slightly to avoid tangling the phone cable with the food and dishes and hangs up. The breakfast consists of eggs, bacon, toast, and coffee. Stella moves behind his chair, pausing again to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Jeff reaches for a knife and fork, lifting a piece of bacon to his lips, but hesitates when Stella speaks, then begins eating appreciatively. The bacon pauses near Jeff's mouth multiple times before he puts it back on the plate as his eyes move slightly to the left, and he just stares ahead. At Thorwald's apartment, with the shades up, we realize that the salesman is in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, as smoke from a newly lit cigar ascends to the ceiling. Meanwhile, the rope-tied trunk remains in the bedroom.",
    "124": "Neff sits in the swivel chair, talking into the dictaphone, having hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more comfortably. The camera moves slowly towards the davenport again, where Neff sits in one corner with his feet on the low table, smoking his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been sitting fairly close to him, but she gets up slowly and crosses to her raincoat, lying over a chair. Neff still does not answer and looks at her slowly, almost absently, then he gets up and grips her arm, his fingers digging into her arm, and kisses her. They have now reached the door, and Neff opens it as Phyllis stands in the doorway, her lips white, and she goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor, slowly closes the door, and goes back into the room, moving across the window to open it wide. He stands there, looking down into the dark street as the rain drifts in against his face, and he just stands there motionless. Neff then sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone, with a used record standing on the desk next to him. The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola, while Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair, his coat and tie over the back of the chair, the evening paper lying tumbled on the floor beside him, a drink in front of him and several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair, holding his rate book partly open with a finger in it for a marker. Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the dialogue as Lola listens without much interest, staring down at her wristwatch. She gets up and starts to go as Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink. Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase while Phyllis is watching closely, and he takes out his fountain pen, unscrews it, and hands it to Mr. Dietrichson, who puts on his glasses and withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the signature line on the supposed duplicate, grunting and signing again. Neff and Phyllis exchange a quick glance as Neff casually lifts the briefcase and signed applications off Dietrichson's lap. Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass, tries the siphon but it is empty, and gathers up his coat and tie, picking up his glass. Neff is zipping up his briefcase as Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway. Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her, his briefcase under his arm, as Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff behind her.",

    "796": "The kid removes his finger, then, before Willie can move, changes his mind and puts the counter back where it was. Willie struggles to contain his irritation. The kid quickly moves one of his pieces, taking three of Willie's, and reaching the far end of the board at the same time. Willie glares and throws the board in the air, while the kid stares placidly at him, unruffled. Willie opens the door to a balding man and proffers his hand, glancing at the kid. The man hands Willie some paperwork. As Grandma nods off in front of the TV, Willie is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub, still wearing his festive red cap, energetically humping Sue, the barmaid, up against the side of the hot tub amid smokes and foam. Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka and her one with orange. They sit on the sofa together, and he hands her her glass; they each take a swig of their respective drinks. She sits back and smiles, laughs to herself, and he nods off. She looks a little bit disappointed. Later, Willie accompanies her to the front door and sees her out. She gives him a kiss and trips over the front step before heading off into the night. Willie shuts the front door and, vodka bottle in hand, reaches over to the hall table where the kid's advent calendar is lying. He picks up the calendar and puts the bottle down on the table, then proceeds to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar and scarf the chocolate inside. Calendar ruined and chocolate eaten, he picks up the vodka bottle and lurches towards the lounge. He stops in the doorway and drains the bottle of its remaining contents, about a quarter, belches, falls backwards, and lies unconscious on the hall carpet. The next morning, he is roused by a distressed kid and is unfazed as his grandma. The kid's hand is covered in blood, and Willie follows him to the kitchen where he puts the hand under the tap and pours vodka on the cut. Willie turns the tap off, takes a slug of vodka, and walks back into the hall, looking slightly uneasy, then spots the tattered remains of the advent calendar lying on the hall table. Later that morning, Willie drives the BMW into the deserted car park where Marcus is standing beside a green van waiting for him. They open the back of the van, and Marcus irritably hands Willie an empty Santa sack. Willie shakes his head, puts a drill in the gift-wrapped box, and with the gift-wrapped safe-breaking equipment loaded into the sack, Willie and Marcus head for the mall.",
    "370": "Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward, when a black car pulls up and two army officers get out, causing Sandra to cry out upon hearing the news. Later, Sandra hangs sheets to dry, forming a tunnel of fabric, and as she pulls a dress from the basket, she looks up and sees a shadow ripple across the white fabric. She freezes, knowing it can't be him—he's dead—and turns away, but with determination, she hangs the dress and retrieves another. Looking up again, she sees Edward himself standing before her, and gasps in disbelief, but his hand is real, so she kisses him without hesitation. Under the covers, a man's hand traces the curves of a woman's back, then she turns over in bed, waking up to Will watching her. Edward is startled as both women quickly gather plates, and Will and Edward smile, knowing the women want this to happen. Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving, as Will cleans leaves from the pool, but the pool is overgrown with algae and slime. A sudden underwater ripple startles Will, who drops the pole into the water and looks around, relieved no one saw. The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will, and Josephine staring into a storeroom, filled with unfinished projects, old products Edward sold, a roll-top desk, and metal file cabinets. Sandra makes a sound of memory while looking through a file and hands Will a yellowed telegram, which shocks him. Sandra stands and Josephine kisses Will before following her, while he re-reads the telegram in disbelief. Searching for a place to set it, he tucks it into a mechanical hand on the desk, which clamps down on it. The camera pushes in on the telegram as Edward's voice begins as a memory, where on a platform Edward pitches a new product to a crowd and kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, still in love.",
    "1027": "He speeds through an intersection, continuing onto a busy street as Pete cuts off a car that narrowly avoids him. An SUV pulls up beside him. Back in the kitchen, Oliver cleans up outside, and Sadie approaches with Joseph. Debbie smiles, and Joseph avoids her gaze. Sadie leaves, and Joseph follows. Pete speeds down the middle of a street, slowing down traffic, and holds out his middle finger, waving a guy past. A car turns right in front of him, and the SUV accelerates ahead. Oliver sits with the girls, glances back at Sadie, and flashes a smile before running off. Sadie grabs her sister. Pete rides through a red light and makes a left between oncoming cars, taking a left onto a quiet side street as he soars down a winding hilly road. Pete coasts around a corner and stands upright, then accelerates past a group of serious cyclists. Debbie drives with Larry in her SUV. Pete makes a left at an empty intersection and rides past a white picket fence. A car door swings open, and a husky man looks down at him, then punches Pete in the face. The man easily absorbs Pete's stomach punch, then knocks Pete over with one. Debbie drives by, gets out, and runs to Pete as the man gets in his SUV. Pete writhes in glass, sees the dealer license plate, and puts his head down as Debbie arrives. The man pulls away. Now, in a hospital hallway, Debbie shakes her head as she sits with Larry. A nurse approaches and steps away, giving an incredulous look. She hugs him, and he gives her back a fatherly pat as she clings to him. They part, and he takes the bill. As he shuffles off, Debbie watches him go with a little smile. On the island, the hero Jack lies dying with Vincent the dog at his side. Oliver watches with the girls and Joseph. Holding Charlotte close, Oliver lifts his chin. Now, in the hospital hallway, a window shows Pete on a bed sporting a bruised, swollen eye. Debbie walks in with a sympathetic smile. He waves, and she perches beside him on the edge of the bed. Her injured husband regards her gravely, and Debbie smiles at him, stands, and starts to help him up. He winces, then swings one leg over the bed, and as she tries to help him again, Pete sits up and kisses her. They share a tender, lingering smooch. Now at a music club, a young singer with moppy dark brown hair strums a guitar at the mic. Debbie brings Pete a bottle of beer, setting her own drink down as she faces the stage and takes his hand. Pete shrugs and gives a delighted smile.",
    "1347": "Jack, in an Air Force uniform and holding a rifle, runs through a dark building and stops against the wall, visibly scared. He peers around a corner and spots guards and vehicles outside on the tarmac through a window. His eyes shift to an aircraft fuel tank, and with wild eyes, he unsafeties his weapon. A soldier crosses to a vehicle, radio in hand, when the fuel tank explodes in a massive blast. Airmen take cover and rush to move nearby vehicles amidst the general mayhem. The camera follows a military jeep as it drives with Jack behind the wheel, blasting through the exit along the road back to town. Jack drives up in the jeep and stops with a shocked expression, seeing a mass of vehicles driving from town. His mind races as the jeep speeds past the camera, revealing Donny driving, Joe in the passenger seat, and Charles, Cary, and Martin in the back. Donny yanks the steering wheel to turn onto a dirt road, and the car rumbles away from the camera. Donny's car pulls up, and the lights go off as the kids pile out. A shot shows the boys climbing a fence, moving quickly across an alley to a trailer locked with a padlock, referred to as the dungeon. Joe tries prying the locks off with a tire iron, but it doesn't budge. He hands the tire iron to Charles, who also fails to open the lock, and then Martin grabs it, successfully breaking off the latch. Inside the dungeon, in darkness, the boys look directly toward us as they discover the mother lode. With flashlights, they turn a corner and hurry down the hall, breaking a classroom door window to enter. Inside, they are surrounded by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16mm film canisters, and cassette tapes. Charles threads the film as Joe holds up a 20-year-old photo of men in a lab, including a 50-year-old named Woodward. Cary inserts a cassette into a tape deck and hits play. They see a hangar where dozens of scientists examine large, bus-sized pieces of jagged, unearthly material. A scientist explains something to a group of senior officers, among them a 32-year-old Nelec. The film jump cuts to a huge reinforced lab cage, inside which sits a massive creature. Another jump cut shows a soldier offering a bucket of food to the alien — it's Woodward.",
    "483": "The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles. She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the Patrolman. He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate. Mary has to force herself to look away. He starts into Mary's car. She stands in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning. As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses. Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase. The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. As she drives out of the lot, we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer, and the Patrolman all looking after her. Mary is driving tensely. CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears. Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought. We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk. Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight, we see the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations beginning to blaze on. Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices again. A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. The first oncoming headlights slash at the windshield. The oncoming headlights blurt at her. It is completely dark now, night. Oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features. Big drops of rain begin to appear. She is becoming aware of the rain starting. The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights. Mary starts the windshield wipers. The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain. Peering through the blurred windshield, slowing down in the flooding highway, peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer, just blackness and rain, peering. An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield. She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road. The lights are on within the office. She tries the door, finds it open, goes into the office. Mary goes to the desk, rings a small pushbell. She looks off in another direction, slightly behind the office, and sees. A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.",
    "1370": "Sadie sits alone watching Lost on an iPad, while Debbie rests next to Charlotte in bed and Pete is sleeping on the couch. Later, Pete sits at the counter, and Debbie and the kids are at the breakfast table. Pete drives Sadie and Charlotte to school, eating an egg sandwich and manically singing along. He walks Charlotte in, gives her a kiss, then walks back towards his car. On the way, he bumps into Joseph and his mom, thinks for a moment, not sure how to handle this, and pokes her shoulder. Meanwhile, Debbie is talking to Jodi, who is crying, when her phone buzzes. Pete and Debbie are sitting across from Vice Principal Laviani, with Joseph's mother, Catherine, in another seat. Debbie tries to hide a smile, and Pete and Debbie leave the school together, suppressing smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off. Debbie is making dinner as Pete and Charlotte sit at the table, and then she walks off. Sadie does her homework on her bed, while Charlotte brings in Sadie's electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her, walks away, and starts to slide the door closed behind her. Later, Debbie is sitting on the couch, Pete paces around the room, and they hug. The shades are closed, the room is dark, and Sadie watches the end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop as Pete enters. Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday, while Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini and plays in the water with the kids. There's an angle on Barb and Debbie, then on Barry and Pete, followed by another angle on Barb and Debbie. Barry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile, and wave. Pete greets guests, including Graham and Grandma Molly. Pete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard, and Debbie walks over with Jason; they leave Ronnie and Jason alone. The guys spot Desi swimming in the pool as Debbie and Pete open the front door, where Oliver is standing with a nervous smile. Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, opening the door wider, but they do not hug. He hands him a bottle. The party is in full swing, with Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry, and Barb getting food from the buffet as Barb and Barry try to help keep the conversation going. Larry arrives with Claire and the triplets, and Claire is holding two of them while Larry carries one. Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator, then puts Jack down, and he runs off, followed by Claire. Sadie, Charlotte, and Desi walk over, and he gives Desi a hug.",
    "709": "As pedestrians scatter, one of the cops stops along the side of the lorry with his gun drawn. He looks up and sees the tarpaulin rippling. He gestures to his partner, who holsters his gun and climbs a ladder on the back of the lorry. He unfastens one of the ropes attached to the tarpaulin, and the tarpaulin flies off to reveal a cargo of tightly-packed sand. The cop at the back of the lorry makes his way across the sand with a shovel. He stops and raises the shovel like a spear, but sand pushes the cop off the lorry onto the windscreen of a car. A huge wave of sand spreads across the top of the lorry and forms into a gigantic hand, which crumbles on the police gunfight. Sandman rises up like a walking giant as a group of cops take aim. As bits of Sandman crumble away in the gunfire, he sweeps down at the cops, bursting in a bucket of sand, blocking cars over as if they were toys. At the key to the city ceremony, Gwen Stacy is at the lectern flanked by city dignitaries. Photographers turn away from the stage, pointing their lenses to the sky as red and blue balloons are released and Spider-Man comes swinging through the crowd, high-fiving them as he sweeps past on a thread. He perches on top of the stage and glides onto the stage upside down. As Spider-Man hangs upside down in front of her, Gwen peels back his mask, exposing his mouth, and plants a passionate kiss on him. Mary Jane looks on in shock and walks off. Everyone looks up as a string of sand whizzes past like an express train. Elsewhere in the city, security guards load up an armored van with cash bags. As the van doors are closed, the sandstorm zooms in like a swarm of angry bees. The guard driving looks at the shadow alongside the van as the mass of sand forms into a human shape standing on the roof. Sandman punches a hole in the roof and boards inside, overwhelming the guards with a torrent of sand. The weight of the sand presses the accelerator on the van, picking up speed. Flint is zipping up a bag of cash as Spider-Man drops through the hole in the roof of the van behind him. Spider-Man dodges a couple of punches, then puts his fist through Flint's stomach. Flint's sandy fist swells to a huge size, and he punches Spider-Man through the back of the van, ripping the door off. Spider-Man fires a thread at the runaway van, leaps onto the torn-off door, and he's dragged along like a water skier as he dodges cars.",
    "205": "The door opens and a woman appears; it is Mrs. Bailey, who has changed amazingly with a harsh and tired face, and her eyes, once kindly and understanding, now show cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him, which is a cruel blow to George. She starts to close the door, but George stops her, and she slams the door shut in George's face. George stands a moment, stunned, then turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen, his features distorted by the emotional chaos within him. They walk out of scene. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be. The two walk into the cemetery, with George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, and Clarence trotting at his heels. George jumps up, grabs Clarence by the coat collar, and shakes him, then lets Clarence go and runs off, while Clarence falls to the ground, rubbing his neck. Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it; we see George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different, with no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life, wearing glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body. She looks flat, dried up, and extremely self-satisfied and efficient. George watches her as she looks up, surprised, but not recognizing him, continues on. George and Mary are on the sidewalk, and Mary starts to run away from him as he follows desperately. He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on her as she struggles to free herself. Mary breaks away from him and dashes into the first door she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar, running in and screaming, while George comes in practically insane. It is crowded, and the place goes into an uproar. Some of the men grab and hold on to him, many of whom were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar. Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car, gets out, and heads for the door to run into George as he comes out. He grabs for George, who punches him, knocking him down, then continues running down the street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun, and fires several shots after the fleeing figure. Bert gets into the police car and, with the siren screaming, sets off in pursuit of George, heading to the same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in.",
    "448": "Don Birnam, dressed in a light summer suit, paces up and down the lobby, keeping an eye on the elevator doors. He carries a florist's box under his arm and walks toward a circular settee, where he sits down, places the flower box next to him, and adjusts his tie, still watching the elevators. On the other side of the settee is a middle-aged couple, Mr. and Mrs. St. James. Although they can't see each other, Don overhears their conversation and eventually realizes they are Helen's parents. Mr. St. James wears a linen suit and a yellowing panama hat, while Mrs. St. James is a cheerful woman with glasses pinned to her dress. Feeling uncomfortable, Don leans his head against the back of the settee. Mr. St. James fumes slightly while Mrs. St. James laughs comfortably. Don then picks up the florist's box, rises, and moves away toward some potted palms for security, from where he looks back. Helen arrives through a revolving door in a new spring suit, sees her parents, and greets them with some conversation about Don arriving shortly. Don, undecided, locates the public phone booths and steps into one, depositing a nickel to dial the number of the Hotel Manhattan. Watching through the glass door of the booth, he sees Helen rise and move to the house phones, where she speaks into a phone and then hangs up with a crestfallen expression. As she returns to her parents, she appears to begin explaining. Meanwhile, Don quietly emerges with the florist's box and exits through a side door. In a dim foreground, the scene shifts to a small table and the vague outline of Don lying on a couch. A key turns in the lock, and Wick enters, finding an empty bottle on the floor and a half-filled glass in Don's hand. Wick turns on the entrance hall light, casually hangs his hat on a hook, and enters the living room, noticing Don's presence. Don covers his face with his arm. Wick, wearing a hat and carrying a briefcase, throws it into a chair and turns off the light.",
    "460": "Great waves of people kneeling are observed, and Buttercup, terribly moved, stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears as her beauty is held on for a moment. Buttercup barrels along, controlling her horse easily through a lovely, quiet, deserted area, but suddenly reins in as she encounters three men standing close together in the path, beyond whom can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are not your everyday commuter types; standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face, he is Sicilian, and his name is Vizzini. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel, and beside him is a giant. As she starts to fall, a sailboat is moored, and it's dusk now, with shadows long, as Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready, while the giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse, and there is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision as the horse takes off and they start for the boat. Vizzini hops onto the boat, in a fury, as Inigo and Fezzik stand as Vizzini advances on them and then glares at him, turns, and leaves them. During this, Inigo has gone close to Fezzik, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received. As they sail off, their voices are heard as the boat recedes; Inigo is at the helm, Fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly—or do they? Vizzini sits motionless as the waves are higher, and there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds. Inigo nods, glancing back as Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess and keeps staring behind them. Suddenly the three whirl and stare back, and as they do, it's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now, but the wind whistles and the waves pound, and suddenly it's all gone ominous. Inigo, Fezzik, and Vizzini squint back, trying desperately to see, and at this moment, they are all holding their breaths. Then, the moon slips through, and Inigo was right—something is very much there—a sailboat. It's a good distance behind them but coming fast, closing the gap, as they stare at the other boat. Buttercup dives into the water, starting to swim away, and Vizzini screams as Buttercup, still close to the boat, switches from a crawl to a silent breaststroke. The wind dies, and as it does, something new is heard; Buttercup stops suddenly and treads water, still not far from the boat, staying silent, and she's gutsy. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past, and though she's scared, petrified—who wouldn't be—she makes no reply, and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her, and she sees it a short distance away, circling, starting to close. Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind as the eel slithers closer and closer, and Buttercup knows now there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over, and now the eel opens its mouth wide, making a noise it's never made before, as its great jaws are about to clamp down.",
    "374": "It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time with the notepad on his lap and the pen in his hand, then cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. Wondering what woke him up, he looks to his right and holds his gaze for a breath. His father, Edward, is awake, silently gasping for breath, with eyes open, scared and confused. Edward shakes his head unambiguously, then nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand and holds it to his father's lips, but Edward won't drink and pushes it away, wanting something else. It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought, feeling like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world. Will realizes something, and Edward nods again, looking around confused and increasingly scared, seeing the end approaching but not knowing exactly what's coming. Without the story, he's lost and fighting the urge to panic. Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate, and eyes the nurse call button, really wanting to press it. Edward waits for Will to begin but throws back the covers, and before Will can answer, he spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up as the Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room. Seeing security guards heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down. Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet as the chair nearly crashes into the back wall while the doors close. Racing Edward down the row, they finally reach the Chevrolet, and Will lifts his father out of the chair and sets him in the passenger seat, then hands it off. Edward unscrews the cap but instead of drinking it, douses himself and soaks the blanket. Will pops the trunk, and Edward, focused completely on Will's story, enjoys that detail. Will stops short because of traffic backed up, honking to get around the jam. Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands as Karl the Giant clears a path by brute force. Edward leans out the window and waves to Karl, who waves back. They arrive at the same stretch of the river where it all began, where a crowd of more than 100 is waiting. Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom, as well as Edward's mother and father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way. While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet. Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.",
    "431": "He looks over at Charlie, asleep in the next bed, then rolls out of bed and goes to the window, where he sees a neon sign flashing across the street that reads AMES BILLIARDS. Eddie returns to his bed, leaves the keys to the Packard and some money on the night table next to Charlie, picks up his valise, his hanging bag, and his leather cue case, and goes toward the door. As Eddie enters, carrying his bags, a few early morning travelers -- some soldiers and a man in a Stetson hat -- pass him by. He has been up all night. It is a typical bus station washroom at that time of the morning, with the residue of a full day's traveling in evidence: crumpled paper towels, cigarette butts, and more. Part of the residue is a drunk who sits on the shoeshine seat, fast asleep. Eddie looks at him, shaking his head. A sign on the wall reads IS THIS YOUR LUCKY DAY? Eddie laughs to himself, puts his hanging bag and cue case on a chair, then turns to face his image in the mirror. A wizened old attendant sits nearby, whose every move seems to require a tremendous effort, and shuffles over to grab a towel as Eddie removes his jacket. Near the row of coin lockers in the waiting room is a small lunch counter and several tables. At one table, facing the lockers, is a young woman, Sarah: a book is open before her, and a cup of coffee, and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. She looks up for an instant as Eddie appears, then her eyes return to the printed page. He locks his bags in a locker and now has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven. Moving toward the counter, Eddie notices Sarah and goes to the lunch counter, still looking at her. He sniffs some wrapped sandwiches, then wanders over to a table next to Sarah's and sits down. She ignores him and returns to her reading. Eddie keeps looking at her. Her hair is brown, cut short, practically straight. Her lips are pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although delicate, is much in evidence. There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self-sufficiency about her, and a frank, open regard which has nothing in it to imply flirtation -- or the lack of it. Sarah goes back to reading. The waitress arrives to take Eddie's order, and Eddie holds up two fingers to the waitress, who departs. The coffee comes, and Eddie leans back against the wall and shuts his eyes. He slips off to sleep, and the waitress brings a check.",
    "467": "The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen after first sniffing it himself, and as he vaults onto his horse, they all charge off. Buttercup, being spun into camera view, falls heavily as the Man In Black releases her at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe; below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun. The Man In Black says nothing, watching Buttercup closely, and if she did not hate Roberts so, there would probably be tears. Buttercup nods. The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand on the edge of the sheer ravine, but then something catches his attention. The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's horses is rising up into the sky, and while his attention is on the dust cloud, Buttercup pushes him with all the strength she has. The Man In Black, teetering on the ravine edge for a moment, then begins to fall, rolling, spinning, and crashing down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine. Buttercup, staring transfixed at what she has wrought, stands alone as from far below words drift up to her on the wind. Without a second thought, she starts into the ravine and soon is falling, spinning and twisting, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved. The dust cloud rises as Prince Humperdinck and the others rein in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom. The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale. Two bodies lie a few feet apart, not moving. After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion. Buttercup, bruised and torn, watches as Westley crawls slowly toward her. They begin to kiss, tender and loving and gentle, racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up at the top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and Buttercup, and it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist, sulfurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great trees block the sun, and though Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, he moves jauntily along, sword in hand. The giant trees, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and shield all but intermittent stripes of sun. Westley instantly forces Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire.",
    "966": "David halts an oncoming car by holding up a hand and pulls Elise safely across the street. Fording through it, he leads Elise out onto a grassy island. Looking up, she sees the Statue of Liberty towering above. David spots a pair of doors, crosses to them, and faces Elise. Elise's eyes pool with tears. She hangs her head and then takes in David's earnest expression. A tear rolls down her cheek. She swallows and nods bravely. Elise goes to him and takes his hand. They face a set of double doors. David takes hold of the right hand knob. They turn the knobs, and the doors open to a long hallway with a polished marble floor. As they enter, the doors shut behind them. On the street, Thompson and his aide gawk. Their plan book shows David and Elise's pathway has united, and intermittent red dots flash in a column. At the bureau, Harry reads the same in his plan book. With a grave look, he steps away. David and Elise push open a pair of doors and enter the bureau reading room. David knocks a staffer out of the way. Leaving Elise behind him, he shoves another. They race along a walkway bordering the room. David finds a door, and they hurry through. Thompson and his staff enter the reading room. Bureau members stare as they march down the center aisle. Meanwhile, David and Elise hurry up a palatial spiral staircase. In the reading room, Thompson leads his team to the peripheral walkway, then the door. David glances upward. The flights of stairs seem to continue infinitely. Now in a white marble hall. The staffer holds out a large manila envelope. Harry grimly takes it, heads back down the hall, and turns out of view. Now a black-garbed intervention team passes through a columned archway. Thompson and his staff jog up the spiraling stairway. At a landing, he slides open a door of bronze bars. Now David and Elise reach a hallway. He takes her hand, and they hurry on. David peers over his shoulder. They reach a door, glance about, and go through. In a green-carpeted office, a bookish receptionist looks up. The two intruders run through a series of identical offices. David offers a staffer a cordial wave as he and Elise proceed through the offices. Now the black-clad intervention team marches into a records archive where rows of bookcases shelve white-spine volumes. David and Elise arrive in another identical records room. Reaching the far end, they find two intervention teams approaching. David leads Elise through more of the bafflingly connected records rooms. Finding a dark green door framed in green marble, he desperately yanks it open.",
    "464": "The narrative begins with an unsuccessful attempt by the protagonist, followed by more failed efforts. As he attempts a few final desperate moves, they prove to be ineffective. The Man In Black is then smashed into a stone pillar and pinned there by the six-fingered sword. He switches hands, fully engaging in the battle, but is pushed back down the steps. Trying various styles, he is eventually controlled by the Man In Black, who then disarms him. Inigo retreats, jumping from the stairs to a moss-covered bar, swings out, lands, and retrieves his sword while the Man In Black watches him, then tosses his own sword to the landing. Mimicking Inigo, the Man In Black dives to the bar, performs a gymnastic maneuver with a high-scoring backflip, leaving Inigo staring in awe. He then dunks Inigo's head with the sword handle, rendering Inigo unconscious. The Man In Black retrieves his scabbard and pursues the Princess. Vizzini observes from a mountain path as the Man In Black runs below while FEZZIK stands with the Princess nearby. Time passes and Vizzini points them out. A nearby boulder is noted as Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away. FEZZIK grabs a rock and moves behind the boulder, as the Man In Black races up the mountain trail. He approaches a bend, slows, and listens. Hearing nothing, he continues, and a rock suddenly shatters on a boulder before him. Moving into the path, he picks up another rock but is signaled by the Man In Black to stop, who removes his sword and scabbard and approaches FEZZIK unarmed. He tosses away the rock, and although the Man In Black is sizable, he is dwarfed by FEZZIK. The Man In Black then launches an attack, delivering fierce blows, twisting FEZZIK’s arm, and executing wrestling moves, but FEZZIK is unaffected. Finally, the Man In Black steps back, gazing up at the Giant, and they prepare to begin their confrontation again.",
    "795": "Gin munches on his orange and regards bespectacled Bob, who looks away thoughtfully. That night, Willie drives a seven series BMW in through the gates of the motel, sees someone with a torch in his room, and kills the lights of the car. She takes the strawberry blonde wig off and comes over. On the phone, Willie puts his stuff down on a bed and begins taking off his fake snow-covered boots. He gets off the bed, goes over to a wardrobe, and the kid watches Willie in the bath, blinking a couple of times. Willie lies in bed with the kid hovering at the bedside, and the next morning, Willie is still asleep in bed when the kid comes in, clutching a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, Willie surfaces from his slumber, sits up, and takes the glass, gives the kid a look, and puts the glass down. The kid climbs onto the bed, settles beside Willie, opens the relevant door on the calendar, and then reads what's written on the back of the door. The kid gives a doubtful-looking Willie the door, knocks the chocolate out of the calendar, performs the action, and turns to Willie. The kid gets off the bed, and Willie looks dubiously at the door off the calendar. At lunchtime, he is eating with Marcus and his oriental girlfriend, Lois, at a restaurant in the mall. Marcus regards him with thinly-veiled contempt as Willie masticates a massive mouthful of salad and glares vainfully at Marcus. Lois and Marcus head off, and a mom and her young son spot Willie in his Santa suit. Jimmy's mother looks at Willie expectantly as she holds the hand of her sulky boy by her side. Jimmy's mum scoops him up and hurries away, leaving dear old Santa to his salad. Out in the shops, Lois scrutinizes a swatch of fabric, tries on a pair of designer sunglasses, moves on, and looks over a mink stole with a very critical eye. Having decided it's not too bad, she notes it down on her shopping list, and detecting a possible sale, a saleswoman comes over to her. Again, Gin, the security chief, walks up behind a boy pursuing a shelf of video games and then turns back to the boy. Back at his new digs, Willie is playing checkers with the kid who moves a piece, keeping his finger on it, uncertain, he moves it back again. Willie eyes the kid a little impatiently as the kid moves another counter, still keeps a pudgy finger on it, looks at Willie, changes his mind, and moves it back. Willie watches as the kid moves a third piece but still keeps his finger on the counter.",
    "204": "The scene begins with a series of shots depicting night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, and pool halls emitting blaring jazz music. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and the motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. George stops before the former offices of the Building and Loan, where a crowd watches the police raiding the place, dragging screaming women into a patrol wagon, including Violet Bick, who is dressed as a tart. George talks to one of the cops but is shoved aside. He notices Ernie's taxi cruising by, which stops to pick him up. As Ernie drives, he spots Bert the cop by his police car and signals him to follow, indicating a problematic passenger. Bert follows in his car as the taxi parks at the curb, and George exits to look at a house, momentarily stopped by its dilapidated appearance with broken windows, sagging porch, fallen roof section, and askew doors and shutters. The police car arrives and Bert and Ernie watch George, who approaches the house like a doomed man. Ernie uses his cab's spotlight to illuminate the house's interior ghostlike. George cries out, appearing like a call for help. Clarence suddenly leans against a wall as Bert, with gun in hand, stands in the entrance and rushes toward him. Ernie follows closely, ready to assist. Bert tries to lead George away, but George struggles to explain, prompting Bert to raise his gun intending to strike George. Clarence intervenes, biting Bert's wrist, allowing George to escape the house and run down the street while Bert and Clarence wrestle, falling to the ground. Bert attempts to handcuff Clarence, but Clarence disappears, leaving Bert amazed before he runs out of the scene. Meanwhile, George runs up the path and knocks on the door of the house.",
    "501": "The establishment is called the SILVER BULLET, with a sign flashing COCKTAILS — BEER — DANCING — FOOD. It features a large gravel parking lot filled with many pickup trucks and older cars, indicating that even though it's early, it is a true night spot, and it's already pretty crowded and lively. There are ten pool tables surrounded by crowds, a long bar filled with customers, and tables and booths, while the room is dense with smoke. The dance floor remains inactive as the band is still setting up, and there are many single men present. Numerous heads turn to watch Thelma and Louise as they find an empty table. A waitress arrives and leaves two menus at their table. After leaving briefly, the Waitress returns with Louise's drink, which Louise understands. Harlan laughs, and although Thelma joins in, she doesn't fully get the joke, and Harlan soon leaves. Thelma downs her Wild Turkey shot and signals the Waitress for another. Both women momentarily drift into thoughts about their domestic issues until the Waitress returns. Thelma observes Harlan at the bar making dancing gestures at her, she smiles and waves, but then her expression turns serious when she looks back at Louise. Thelma's speech is rapid, but Louise is accustomed to it, smiling wistfully at Thelma's insights. Louise finishes her Wild Turkey, raising her glass as the BAND starts a lively tune. She then drinks her tequila shot and raises her glass again. Thelma has been dancing with Harlan for some time, while Louise is dancing with a quiet man named Dan. Thelma, breathless, drunk, and giggly, holds a beer bottle and laughs over nothing as Harlan watches her closely, which Louise notices before heading to the bathroom. Thelma stumbles, dropping her beer, and Louise approaches a long line of women outside the bathroom. Harlan steers Thelma out the door to the parking lot. Thelma is limp and pulls away as Harlan leans close to her and tries to embrace her. Just as Louise exits the bathroom while another woman enters, she scans the room for Thelma, approaches the table, and sees Thelma's belongings still there.",
    "936": "Holmes is pulled up by Watson, who removes the meat hook from his shoulder, and as Holmes looks up at him, Watson helps him up and supports him as they make their way back across the factory floor, passing several Howitzers ready to be shipped out. They arm themselves, with Watson carrying a machine gun and Holmes a pistol, and Watson leads the way. In the ruins, Moran frees Moriarty from the rubble. Sim spots Holmes and Watson, running ahead of them. Holmes sees some guards, and Watson opens fire, laying down covering fire as Sim and the gypsies lead the way out of the factory. As Watson retreats and reloads, Holmes shoots a guard dead, reloads, and follows the others out into a rail yard, where one of the gypsies is killed by the rough-looking twins. Holmes and Watson return fire, killing them both. The raiders make their way to the perimeter wall of the rail yard and throw a rope over it, but before they can escape, guards spot them and open fire, forcing them to take cover. Watson returns fire with his machine gun, but the guards respond with a heavy-caliber Gatling gun, forcing them behind some crates as a huge artillery piece is turned on them. The shell goes over their heads and blasts a hole in the perimeter wall, and Holmes and the others run for it, out into the woods beyond. In the distance, a railway line runs through the trees with a train approaching. The captain of the guards rallies his troops through the breach in the perimeter wall to chase them down, and as the guards shoot through the trees, others in the rail yard adjust the mortars and open fire. Explosions erupt around Holmes, Watson, and the others as they keep running towards the railway line. Moran, giving chase, picks up a rifle and takes a shot at Watson, clipping his right flank, but he keeps running as bullets rip chunks out of tree trunks. Holmes returns fire with his pistol, hitting a guard in the chest amidst massive explosions, as Sims sprints forward with guards in chase. Moran takes another shot, hitting one of the gypsies, and Sims sees the man go down but keeps running. Little Hansel, a heavy-caliber artillery piece, has a massive shell loaded into its breach, the barrel's elevation is adjusted, a powder charge is loaded, and after final adjustments, the gun crew chief gives the order to fire.",
    "492": "Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church quietly, with its old stone and huge towers making it stand out from the modern buildings all around it. He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors and slips inside. Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews. Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church. He moves down the center aisle towards the back and finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each other but stays rigid, hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen. Malcolm nods at the information, smiles at Cole, and his eyes drift down to Cole's arms, which are covered in tiny cuts and bruises. Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other. Lynn walks over to Cole, checks his tie, and unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room. The dog is gone now, and Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and screams at the top of her lungs, as every cabinet and every drawer is wide open. Cole sits at the kitchen table, his hands pressed flat on the tabletop, looking shaken. Neither says anything for a beat. Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink, where the pop tarts are clearly visible. Lynn leans down, Cole does, and he looks at her eyes. Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts, takes them from her, and leaves. Lynn glances to the kitchen table, and her gaze stops on the two tiny handprints of sweat formed on the table's surface. Tommy Tammisimo, a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid in his school uniform, waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs. Cole emerges from the brownstone, moves down the steps, and the two boys begin their walk down the street to school. Tommy puts his arm around Cole, and Cole waves back. When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight, Tommy rips his arm away. Cole starts to smile too and thinks. Cole and Lynn smile at each other, and Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the kitchen. The den doubles as a playroom, with boxes of old toys sitting in the corner and a small, plastic, multi-colored table on the rug. Cole appears in the doorway, and Malcolm sits up and smiles.",
    "1142": "She peers mischievously into the water as Harry attempts to preserve his modesty with some bubbles while Myrtle leans her head on his naked shoulder. In the library, Ron puts the golden egg on the table, and he and Hermione leave reluctantly as Harry piles up his books and tidies his notes. Moody leaves them alone, and Harry looks at Neville apologetically. At the lake, Fred and George take bets as Neville hands over the gillyweed. Three tall spectator pavilions have been erected in the lake, and Harry chokes on the gillyweed as three of the competitors dive in and Moody pushes Harry in after them. Gasping for breath, he sinks down amongst the metal supports of the pavilions, clutching his neck as gills develop on either side like a fish. He looks down and sees his feet turn into flippers, holding up his hands as they become webbed. Seamus stares down into the water as Harry suddenly hurtles up out of the water, somersaults in the air like a dolphin, and vanishes again under the surface. Harry kicks out with his flippers and swims through the water weed over the rock-strewn bed of the lake, which falls away in front of him into a deep ravine as he dives into the murky darkness, arms held close by his sides. Fish swim beside him as he moves easily through the water, wearing shorts and a singlet with Potter written on the back, and his wand is in a sheath, strapped to his leg. He heads through a narrow channel, peering uncertainly through the cloudy water, and swims through ropes of dark green weed hanging like curtains in front of him. Harry looks over his shoulder and spots a figure behind: Fleur is swimming strongly, a delicate filmy veil over her mouth and nose, with her long fair hair streaming behind her. Something whips past her face, and Fleur suddenly disappears, pulled down out of sight as Harry is knocked aside by something that flashes past. Recovering himself, he catches sight of a silvery tail vanishing into the Forest of Weed and follows the merperson as it leads him above the jagged rocks on the bottom of the lake. Far ahead, he sees the ruins of a stone archway and kicks out strongly with his flipper feet, with tall columns rising around him like an underwater cathedral. He swims past ruined archways, their outlines softened by algae and water weed, before reaching four people in black cloaks floating upright in front of him - Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small girl with long fair hair - their eyes closed and faces blank, while unfriendly-looking merpeople lurk ominously close, carrying sharp tridents and lashing their tails. Harry unties the rope around Ron's ankle and moves toward Hermione.",
    "174": "Harry's smile goes away as Chili smiles at her, and they appear hooked. Martin is leaning and then leans forward. Bo Catlett exchanges a look with the Bear and signals the waiter. Karen, Martin, and Chili walk out to the driveway, and Chili follows Martin over to the minivan, opening the door for him. In the meantime, Bo Catlett and Harry are laughing, with Harry very drunk as he finishes another drink. Harry looks at Bo, unable to believe what's happening to his life, thinks for a moment, shakes his head, and looks around the restaurant. Bo and the Bear exchange looks as Chili and Karen enter the restaurant. Chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing, keeping his eyes up there as he speaks. Another glance at the Bear, and they all look. Chili moves to the staircase, seeing the Bear in his Hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top, and slowly moves his gaze up through hibiscus until he's looking at the man's bearded face. Chili continues up the stairs to where Bo Catlett stands beside the table, unbuttons his coat, and gets within three steps of the guy before stopping, keeping his eyes fixed on the man's gut. Bo walks past Chili and goes down the stairs. Karen watches as Bo Catlett puts a hand in his coat pocket and steps right up to Chili; she looks at him. Even Karen is looking at him differently now as they slide into the booth with a now shocked, rapidly sobering Harry. Karen and Chili look at each other as Harry finishes his drink, and Harry looks at the two of them differently now. Chili looks at Karen, smiles, and shakes his head. Harry looks at him and then hangs up at the other end. Bones thinks about it a moment and tosses the book aside, while phone to his ear, Harry downs another drink and sits up as Bones bursts out of the john, grabs the phone, getting Bones's attention. Bones stares at the phone, sits there a moment, also staring at the phone, while Chili stands as Curtis opens Chili's wallet, looks at the driver's license, and Dunbar in the plaid shirt pulls the Lakers T-shirt out of the athletic bag, feels around inside. Chili watches Curtis pick up the note with the Newark Flight number and arrival time written on it, glances about to make sure no one's around, then pulls the key for the 'right' locker out from a crack in the pavement near the stairwell. Now there's a big guy in a plaid wool shirt next to him, the same guy seen when Bo Catlett was there, and another guy down the aisle talking on his hand radio.",
    "455": "The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. Two large tubs are present, one filled with steaming water, the other with icy water. Without a word, Fezzik stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot. Then a wild look hits Inigo. Yellin enters and kneels, showing the key dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters, and the Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. Buttercup stares at Humperdinck. With that, he whirls, turns on The Machine, and shoves the lever all the way up. There has never been such pain. A few children pale and bolt toward their parents. The Albino appears wheeling a barrow as Inigo's sword pushes at his chest. The Albino shakes his head, says nothing, and Fezzik crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops without a sound. Inigo kneels, the sword held tight between his hands, eyes closed, facing the grove of trees, starting to talk with a low and strange voice. Now he rises, eyes still closed, as he walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. Fezzik, frightened, follows close behind, walking blind through the grove of trees. Inigo moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it, then stops. For a long moment, he stands frozen, suddenly whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot, and nothing happens. He has failed. In utter despair, he collapses against the tree, against a knot in the tree, against the knot in the tree, which slides away, revealing the staircase. Fezzik and Inigo look at each other, then start down to Westley, dead by The Machine. Fezzik leans over him, listening for a heartbeat, then he looks at Inigo and shakes his head. For a moment, he just sags, terribly excited, and looks stronger than they've yet seen him, desperately fighting for control. Inigo, in despair, in the Pit, as before. They approach the door and knock. If Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. Inigo pounds again, and the window is shut. They rap on the door. Inigo and Fezzik hurry inside, with Fezzik carrying Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little.",
    "1045": "Howard zooms back in vision as Barnes watches keenly, observing Veronica throw her bag under the podium. Suddenly, Barnes and Howard are thrown off their feet by the force of the explosion, and flames soar up from the podium while black smoke fills the plaza. As the smoke subsides, Howard slowly sits up, rubs the back of his neck, checks his hand for blood, and takes in the scene of devastation in front of him. He stretches out for his camera by his side and sees Barnes with the injured Matthews. Howard pushes himself up onto his feet, looks around, and sees little Anna standing alone. She nods OK, and he picks her up in his arms and runs out of the plaza with her. Outside, he hears Holden chasing Enrique, sees Enrique making his escape, and notices Holden and Parsons in pursuit. Still carrying Anna, Howard runs after them and stops in front of a policewoman as Enrique keeps running, with Holden and Parsons racing after him on the street outside the plaza. Howard heads after them, filming as he goes, as Enrique dashes into a gated stone building with Holden and Parsons sprinting after him. Howard charges through the tall gate and halts inside a large church while the agents pursue Enrique out into the street, with Howard hot on their tail. Anna looks frantically for her mother and mistakenly chases a different olive skin woman. Howard videotapes a red sedan plowing into Enrique, who staggers to his feet and runs, prompting Parsons and Holden to dart after him across the busy road. Howard dashes through the panicking crowd in hot pursuit as they race under colored canopies on a market street. Heavyset Howard stops to catch his breath, captures Holden and Parsons on tape as they disappear around a corner, and then darts down a parallel street. Beating down the side street, Howard sees Enrique make a B-line for a busy highway, beams incredulously, and gives chase with the camcorder held out in front of him. Enrique's pistol is holstered in his belt beside his police badge as a white sedan brakes sharply while he bounds out into the road. Howard stops by the roadside, spots a pedestrian bridge over the highway, scampers up steel steps, and hot foots it along the bridge. He stops and stares out through some chain link mesh to see Enrique slow to a stop at an underpass and cranes the camera on him, spotting Enrique's badge as a squad car drives up in front of Enrique and a policeman approaches him.",

However, he holds out his hand, and she gives him the mirror. Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, takes a breath as if about to dive underwater, and starts to look, giving himself a small, mumbled pep talk. He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror. An establishing shot features Verdell tied up in front as Carol looks totally beat while setting down a cup of coffee. Melvin cranes periodically to keep an eye on his dog. When she reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon, he goes nuts, and she is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice and becomes almost chatty. Melvin nods, slightly frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story, and he pockets the remaining bacon. As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, a beat before Melvin, something remarkable: Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. Melvin slows down and observes the dog mirroring his behavior by carefully placing his paws to avoid cracks. Melvin laughs out loud and hurriedly puts on plastic gloves to lift the dog to eye level. Later, Melvin is at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as Verdell sits fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing aloud to the dog, and as he looks over, Verdell trots over, and without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him, surprising Frank. Verdell looks up at him, then Melvin walks to the door, turns the lock, and checks that they are locked. He feels anguished until he briefly breaks down while the dog looks on. Melvin opens the door and shudders when he sees the scarred Simon in a wheelchair. A beat of silence follows as Melvin considers whether to comply with Simon, who pats his leg, trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell to approach him. Instead, the dog goes to the door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog up as Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word. Melvin shakes his head and notices every new element carefully before getting comfortable. In the almost-crowded waiting room, more patients are visible as Melvin passes through, visibly drawn and upset. He stops, eyes on them, and they look stricken. He exits as Cheryl, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table while he, unseen, takes out his utensils and arranges them.",
    "417": "Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder, and Elaine looks from Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her mother's eyes staring. She moves toward him as though to hit him, and Elaine slams the door shut. Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben, and he looks at her in horror. She gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream. Ben sits cross-legged on his bed in the dark, his back against the fish tank, smoking. Ben drives by in his car and looks at the house. Dressed differently, Ben stands by the window overlooking the backyard, and over his shoulder, Mr. Braddock is seen down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool with a long-handled scoop. Mr. Braddock looks up at Ben's window, and Ben moves aside. Ben is standing behind a tree watching the Robinson house, where in the driveway, Elaine is getting into the Robinson car, and Mr. Robinson is putting Elaine's luggage into the car. Mrs. Robinson stands at the door as Mr. Robinson gets into the car and starts it, and the car drives down the driveway and down the street. Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his desk writing. On the piece of paper is written: DEAR ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, and her name several dozen times. He stops and looks up. It is early morning. A swinging door is pushed open to reveal Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which an orange tree can be seen, while Ben stands inside the door. Mr. Braddock starts to smile. Ben is driving his car, and on the empty campus, dressed carefully in his black suit, he sits on a bench in the quadrangle outside of Wendell Hall. The quadrangle and the area around him fill up with students; walking, talking, hurrying to class, strolling, sitting, reading, handing out petitions, etc. Elaine comes out carrying her books and walks in Ben's direction, approaching from the distance. As she walks, she is joined by another girl with whom she converses, and as they approach, they are joined by a tall boy with a beard. He starts toward them, falters, straightens himself, and Mr. McCleery stops and turns, almost causing Ben to run into him. Mr. McCleery takes a couple of steps up, Ben following, and stops again before taking a couple more steps and stopping once more. He looks at Ben searchingly, then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall. The lady sitting next to Elaine looks at her, turns around and looks at Ben, then looks at Elaine again.",
    "452": "Westley examines where the flames burst over Buttercup and pulls her aside to safety as another great spout of flame suddenly shoots up, while Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand and gently leads her forward as they move slowly through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. Later, with the sun slanting down at a slightly different angle, Westley picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, and continues talking without missing a beat. Using his sword, Westley slices a path for them, causing the vines to groan as they fall, all while chatting. Westley picks Buttercup up to carry her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch, and they have by now crossed the pond. As Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply, the ground gives way beneath her—it’s Lightning Sand—and she sinks into it, crying Westley’s name before disappearing. Whirling, Westley slashes a U-shaped vine in half, grabs it, drops his sword, and dives into the lightning sand, clutching the other end of the vine, resulting in another cloud of white powder. Nothing can be seen now except the lightning sand, which is lovely and lethal. A giant R.O.U.S. darts into view, sniffs around, and then disappears. Westley, with lungs near bursting, explodes out of the sand with Buttercup across his shoulders, pulling them to the edge of the pit using the vine. Buttercup's face is caked with white powder—in her eyes, ears, hair, and mouth—yet she is still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it, as Westley continues to pull them to safety. The R.O.U.S., high above them, watches. Buttercup is placed against a tree while Westley cleans the lightning sand from her face. The R.O.U.S., now on a much lower branch, stares down at Westley, who stares back. As Buttercup's eyes flutter, he continues to work on her. There are now two R.O.U.S.s that have climbed into a nearby tree, staring hungrily down. Westley picks Buttercup up, puts an arm around her, and starts to walk with her as he encouragingly continues talking.",
    "937": "A lever is pulled, a ratchet releases, and the powder charge is ignited. The massive gun recoils violently as a huge ball of flame erupts from its muzzle, and the shock wave blows one of the gun crew's hat off. In the woods, the shell rips through a tree trunk, splintering it into matchwood, felling another tree just behind Holmes and missing him by a whisker. The shell explodes ahead of him, shattering the trees and filling the air with needle-sharp splinters, and the epic blast blows the fugitives off their feet. The guards keep coming, closing in, and Holmes lies still for a few moments, temporarily stunned by the blast. As dirt falls on his face, he comes to, and he and Watson get to their feet. Watson immediately tackles a guard as fierce hand-to-hand fighting breaks out, and Moran runs towards the fray. A gypsy shoots a guard just before a mortar shell goes off beside Holmes. As he leans against a tree, a guard comes at him, the bullet hits the tree, and then the guard tries to bayonet Holmes, who punches the guard away and reloads the guard's rifle. He hands it to Watson, who uses it to shoot Moran as he appears over a rise. Holmes, Watson, Sim, and the surviving gypsies run to the train and scramble into one of the boxcars. As they're doing so, Moran starts to sit up, examines his injury, and, as Holmes climbs up into the boxcar, Moran gets his gun, takes several deep breaths, loads his rifle, and takes aim. He shoots one of the gypsies as he tries to board the train, and another gypsy watches from the boxcar as his dead comrade is left behind. Moran stares after the train as it carries Holmes and the others to safety. The track winds along a wooded valley, and in the morning, the train makes its way across a snow-covered plain with craggy mountains in the distance. Sim sits cradling Holmes in her arms as Watson stitches a wound in his own flank, and Holmes closes his eyes. Sim regards Holmes with growing concern, holding her hand in front of his mouth, and concerned, Watson goes over to her and examines Holmes, who's completely unresponsive. A gypsy does so as Watson pumps away at Holmes' chest and thumps it. Still no response, Watson pounds Holmes' chest again. Sim pulls Watson away from Holmes and hugs him tight, and the gypsy pats Watson on the shoulder. Watson looks down sadly at Holmes, who lies motionless in the boxcar. Something suddenly occurs to him, and Watson opens the leather pouch which Holmes gave him and takes out a vial and hypodermic needle. Watson uncaps the needle and plunges it into Holmes' chest.",
    "382": "In an Alabama field where a second-rate carnival is parked, Edward controls his breathing, trying to push through the pain while still carrying the backpack seen earlier, scratched up from his trip through Spectre. She returns with her camera as Edward smiles, masking the pain. A devilish smile appears as he joins the crowd and heads into the big-top, where a troupe of stilt-walking firebreathers finishes their act to tremendous applause. As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster, Amos Calloway, who is only four feet tall but has a titanic presence, approaches the stands. From behind Amos, carnies begin rolling a massive ball towards the crowd, and as the carnies back away, a deep drum roll begins. A foot suddenly bursts out from within the ball with gasps from the crowd, revealing its massive size as Edward looks closer. As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot, followed by hands, shoulders, and finally a head, emerges. From a low angle, we see just how massive he is, seeming to fill the Heavens, resembling more ogre than man with his shaved head and giant club. In the bandstands, a young boy's jaw drops in awe as a tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd. Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed, and leans with the spotlight, whistling to get the big man's attention, then points to the edge of the stands where his friend is sitting on the dirt. The giant stands up, a good foot taller than Colossus, causing gasps and nervous anticipation from the crowd. Amos stands stunned, megaphone dangling, while Colossus, realizing the gig is up, with a resigned shrug, rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows. As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos, who pulls Karl aside for a hard sell, as Edward notices a beautiful young woman in a blue dress and hat leaving with her family. For no good reason, she looks back, making eye contact with Edward, freezing all motion around them as a fiery baton halts mid-twirl and a spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air. Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies and ducking underneath arms to get closer to the woman.",
    "783": "Kevin slips into an apartment as another resident exits, while Jane is in the kitchen. She puts down a cup she's washing, goes to the door, and sees Kevin through the peephole, looking exasperated. Kevin, with his eyes closed, hopes he hasn't gone too far and talks into a dictaphone. In astonishment, his jaw drops as he spots a closet full of dresses. Jane rushes after him, barges him out of the way, and closes the closet doors before striding off to put on a shiny dark green dress. Kevin, disbelieving, takes a photo of the closet, and Jane rolls her eyes self-consciously. She then pulls out a yellow dress with pleats and orange flowers, while a bridesmaid falls over. Next is a twirly orange number and a Japanese-style kimono, and they bow to each other as Kevin takes a photo. At a wedding, Jane crouches to be the same height as the Japanese bridesmaids, one wearing long black gloves and even a man's evening suit. Jane performs a high-stepping routine with a top hat, sashays in pink floral print, and models a bright dress like yellow and pink candy floss. Kevin gets caught up in a white skirt like a giant snowflake, with dazzling yellow. The wedding takes place on a lawn overlooking the ocean, with bridesmaids in tiny pink strapless mini-dresses. Jane poses with a heavily made-up bride and much older, open-shirted groom in gauzy red, shiny candy pink, and flowery baby blue while Kevin lounges on the couch taking pictures. Kevin finds a cowboy hat with a red flower on the brim, and at a wedding, Jane sits on a horse that faces the wrong way for the photo. He also finds a pair of flippers, and at an underwater wedding, Jane smiles in a floral bathing cap as the bride and groom share a watery kiss. Kevin reaches for the dictaphone and catches Jane off guard, looking sad and vulnerable. They sit opposite each other in uncomfortable silence, and later, still looking unhappy, Jane hangs the dresses back in the closet. On a sunny day, Jane arrives at Tess' apartment and becomes suspicious as Tess blocks the doorway, while Pedro is vacuuming and dancing, making Jane look appalled. Meanwhile, Kevin is at work, watches Maureen walk off, shaking his head, and later he and Jane scan bar codes on wedding list items, including china penguins. Jane looks mortified as Kevin grins and brandishes the scanner. High above the busy streets at the New York Journal, Kevin approaches Maureen's office, looking horrified. Jane hurries to meet George on the terrace of the boathouse. Back at the paper, Kevin picks up the phone.",
    "568": "Edwards is shocked and pulls his own weapon, pointing it at Kay's head, then whirls around to see Jeebs' body growing another head, which takes only four or five seconds. Kay raises the weapon again, threatening, and Jeebs nods, the point taken. Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons as Kay leaves. The flash dims on Edwards and Kay, sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant where Edwards takes the remaining chair. Zed continues addressing the recruits, who all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly while Edwards's hand is indeed up. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand, and Zed calls on him. Edwards tries to stifle a laugh but can't while Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast with three bullet holes in its chest, next to a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head with three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl, and Zed sighs, with sideways glances from the other recruits. Zed and Kay stand behind smoked glass, staring at the recruits still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision. Zed turns and walks away, and Kay stares through the glass at Edwards, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group. Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. The recruits follow Zed out of the shooting gallery into a long hallway, where Zed motions them off to the left. Edwards is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway where Kay is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night. As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other recruits herded into a corner while Zed pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket, holding it up in front of them as the recruits stare obediently at it and Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses. Alien shapes are visible within a photograph where Dee and Zed are much younger, and in another photograph, a young Kay, in a shirt and tie, holds a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of a landed flying saucer. Kay steers Edwards to the right down another corridor, just as long as the first, and another picture shows the 1964 World's Fair grounds still under construction, with giant models of rockets marking the Fair's theme of space travel, most prominently the two tall towers with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.",
    "499": "He stares statue-like at an abstract point in the room. The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him. Cole is very shaky, and Malcolm watches everything anxiously. Cole stares at Mr. Collins, and the man's face begins to crumble as Cole holds out the jewelry box that trembles in his hands. The father just stares at it and becomes very still, his eyes filling with a storm of confusion and pain. After the longest time, the father reaches and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands, causing Cole to begin to back away. The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd until Cole reaches Malcolm and the two slip out of the house. The father looks down in a daze and goes to open the jewelry box with slow and strained movements. He lifts the latch and opens the box, and Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette. Seated now, his face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance. The puppets go limp as the entire stage gets lifted up, and we see it carried away by Kyra. The whole bedroom is now visible, and the camera is seated on her desk in the corner. Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens; she carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich as the crowd watches in riveted silence. The father never takes his eyes off the screen as the image of the mother walks to a closet and pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner. She reads the label for the ingredients, walks back to the food tray, unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner, and pours some into the cap. Kyra picks up the spoon, takes a sip, and slowly brings the spoon to her mouth, swallows another spoonful, leaving the room utterly silent. Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surround by friends and family, fixing one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table. It takes her a beat before she feels the stare and looks up to see Mr. Collins standing in the doorway to the dining room. A group of ashen-faced guests stand in the distance behind him. Husband and wife's eyes meet as Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears. The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes it in her small hands. The two children don't say anything for a while as Malcolm glances to the house, where all movements in and out of the home have ceased, then looks across to the two children on the swings. Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop room door in the back.",
    "80": "Another TROOPER knocks the pistol from BEN'S lifted hand, causing BEN to sink to his knees as both men and two others close in on him. He takes in the GROUP with his mouth open, and they drive away fast in road dust. Their mother, WILLA, carrying a shopping bag, runs up from the background between the CHILDREN, looking towards cars off-screen; she has a rich body. PEARL comes to her, and she picks up PEARL and the doll, while JOHN, laden with his oath, walks quickly into the house. WILLA does a bewildered take and looks again towards the cars off-screen, while BEN lies in profile. From the bunk above, the face of PREACHER stretches down into the SHOT, upside down and snake-like. BEN wakes, sees PREACHER, and hits him so hard in the face that he falls from the bunk to the floor. PREACHER collects himself into a squat, nursing his face, as BEN sits up in bed. BEN picks up and wads a sock. PREACHER gets up and pockets the knife, while they rest on the sill of the cell window, with the lettered fingers legible, and the right hand is lettered L-O-V-E. The hands open, disclosing his open knife, and they close over it. His eyes lift from his hands, heavenward, in the moonlight on his face. He prays, quietly. In the same SHOT as before, prison lights are now on, and a man, a prison GUARD, waits close inside the door. BART the HANGMAN joins him with a silent salute, wearing a hard derby. They walk in silence into a MEDIUM, MOVING SHOT, with the GUARD talkative and BART reluctant to talk, as the Penitentiary recedes in the background. On the porch by the door is a doll's perambulator. BART and the GUARD walk into the SHOT. The GUARD stops, and BART starts up his front steps, while the GUARD leaves the SHOT; BART goes in and hangs up his coat and hat. Across this, his wife speaks off-screen, and a lighted door is ajar at the rear of the hall. He looks past her, and we see two small CHILDREN asleep in a big brass bed. BART registers, turns again to the basin, and we PAN them back into the original TWO-SHOT. His WIFE'S eyes go sharp and quiet. BART rinses his hands, lets out a sigh, and takes up the towel. He looks at her for a moment and then towards his CHILDREN. He goes into their room on tiptoe, and he approaches his children, across whose bed WE SHOOT without yet seeing them. He comes into MEDIUM CLOSE-UP, and as he leans, and we TILT DOWN, he extends his large hands. Two rose-and-gold little GIRLS lie in sleep; BART'S hands enter the SHOT and gently rearrange the covers so that their mouths and throats are free.",
    "574": "Parrish blinks uncertainly, unsure if he has heard something, and releases his arm as his pain subsides. He soon realizes that he has indeed heard a voice—not the wind—and looks around, finding no one. Unable to finish peeing, he returns to his bedroom, bewildered, trying to trace the source of the sound. Climbing back into bed, he pulls the covers up and attempts to close his eyes, but then sits up again, frightened and indecisive. He finally closes his eyes again, glances at the ceiling, and falls asleep, exhausted. Outside, workmen on the great lawn plant stakes, unroll a canvas tent, and set up platforms, speakers, and lights, while gardeners fashion topiary and add landscaping. Allison, Parrish's older daughter, manages the foremen and relishes the attention. A painter approaches as Parrish, groomed for the day, trots downstairs, observing the intensified activity through the windows. He grins and pours coffee, fidgeting as Susan observes. The sound of a helicopter chopping overhead is heard, and Parrish, leading his family, hurries toward it as the butler and May carry their bags. Drew kisses a woman, glancing at Parrish over her shoulder, while Quince approaches. Drew ushers everyone onto the helicopter, starting with Parrish, then Susan and Quince, before climbing in himself and shutting the door as Allison hurries away. Meanwhile, the Young Man sits at a counter with a plate of food, eating with relish while Susan watches him, captivated. He notices her gaze, swallows awkwardly, and Susan laughs as the Young Man smiles, prompting Susan to look into her coffee. Drew follows Parrish until the open door, where Parrish reminds him that he cannot proceed further without an invitation. Parrish disappears into his office, and Drew glides past Jennifer's desk on his way out. He leans against the back of a couch, surveying the Manhattan skyline through floor-to-ceiling windows, lost in thought.",
    "841": "The detective leaves, while the boss lingers with his arms folded. Sandy gazes at the floor, then rises and watches the men leave. Holding his cell phone, he looks at the salon number displayed in red. He glances up, then down to the number's origin. The detective glances at Daniel, who rubs his face with one hand. Sandy runs off. Sandy's wife helps him pack. Sandy shrugs at his wife. He sets her on the bed. He takes the folded mug shot from his back pocket. She gives him a little nudge. Sandy heads out. He kisses Trish. She hands him his suitcase. Now, a plane sails across the sky. Our view moves over a sunny beach toward a city skyline. Outside Ladies Choice salon, Sandy rolls up his window in a gold Sedan. The plump thief strolls into view in a loud pink print shirt and poofy hair. She walks in slow motion. Sandy observes her go to a tiny blue Fiat with a red stripe on its side. She bounces to the driver's door and gets in. The garishly made-up woman takes a handicapped parking tag off the rear view mirror and tosses it in back. Sandy puts his seat belt on as the woman zips out of her parking space. Now, on a freeway, Sandy tails the thief while she plays with her smartphone. She looks in her rear view and catches sight of him. Setting her phone down, the redhead takes her sunglasses off, looks into the driver's side mirror, and gives her car some gas. The odometer needle rises. Sandy presses his accelerator. The speedometer ticks up to 50. The woman tightens her mouth and slams on the brakes with both feet. The sedan bangs the Fiat's rear bumper. In her rear view, she sees Sandy white-knuckling his wheel. She puts her sunglasses on and primps her hair, then gets out. The short woman looks up at Sandy, then punches his throat. She pushes him and goes for her car. He pulls her hair. She delivers a swift kick to his crotch. Sandy sags as she runs to his car. She gets into his sedan. Sandy limps toward her. She reverses while flipping him off. He shambles back to her Fiat and gets in. He discovers the key missing. In the rear view, he sees an empty road. She comes in from the sides. The sedan T-bones the compact. She pins it to the guardrail. Sandy tries in vain to open the crushed door as she speeds down the highway. He reaches through the sunroof. He finds a pink registration form in the glove box. He takes it out. He reads the address. Now, in a tiny pink house with a jet ski on the lawn, a variety of small expensive products in sets of three or more clutters the kitchen.",

Mr. Darcy gives his usual stilted bow in return, turns, and leaves the room. At the door, he stops and looks back at Lizzie for a moment before finally walking out. Outside, horses are being harnessed to the carriage, and Mrs. Gardiner and Lizzie emerge, dressed in their outdoor clothes. Lizzie turns to him, then climbs into the carriage. At Pemberley, Mr. Darcy is sitting in the drawing room, watching Georgiana practice her piano playing. The Hursts, Mr. Bingley, and Miss Bingley are also present. Miss Bingley stands up, and with a look of utter contempt, Mr. Darcy leaves the room. The two sisters exchange glances. At Longbourn, the Gardiners' four children are playing on the lawn when the carriage pulls into the driveway, and they quickly hurry over to greet it. As the four white horses come to a halt, the footman comes over to open the carriage door and help Lizzie out. Briefly greeting the children, Lizzie hurries inside, where Jane has come to meet her. In her bedroom, Mrs. Bennet is lying back in her chair, fanning herself. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is traveling in a carriage, his expression thoughtful and determined, with four chestnut horses speed through the countryside, a seated driver and two footmen on the back of Darcy's carriage. Now, the Bennet sisters are taking lunch with the Gardiners. Later, Lizzie enters a room and finds Jane standing at the window, gazing out at the gardens. She shuts the door behind her, then walks over to her sister. Lizzie opens it and begins to read. Lydia and Wickham climb into a carriage in the dead of night. Jane looks away with a serious expression, and Lizzie leaves the room. Now, Lizzie is in her nightgown, standing in front of the mirror in her room. Slowly, she looks herself in the eye, then sits down. Her face is full of sorrow, and her eyes are glistening with as yet unshed tears. She remembers Mr. Darcy striding away from her. A knock disturbs her thoughts. Jane comes in and shuts the door behind her, walks over to Lizzie, and takes her hand. Lizzie looks down, then takes Jane's hand again. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy has arrived at a coaching inn. As the innkeeper leads him, a serving boy comes out with tankards full of ale, and Mr. Darcy takes one and drinks from it. The next day, Kitty is playing with a cup and bowl in the garden when she spies a two-wheeled curricle approaching through the trees, and she quickly scampers off across the lawn.",
    "1214": "A truck of army reinforcements arrives, and Rambo gets back on the machine-gun platform as the reinforcements are cut to ribbons in the truck. Rambo fires on the boat, and bullets smash through its windscreen, killing the captain and helmsman. A bullet from School Boy decapitates the machine-gunner. On the shore, BN fires a loaded bazooka, and the boat is obliterated. Rambo spots the commander escaping up the hill, leaps down from the machine-gun platform, and gives chase. The commander stops, impaled on Rambo's machete, and faces Rambo, blowing out his cheeks and looking up at him. Rambo rips the commander's stomach open, and the commander drops to the ground. Rambo kicks the man's corpse away with a hefty boot, and it rolls away and lies face down. Rambo looks wearily down at the field of battle, and from her vantage point with School Boy, Sarah does the same. A couple of straggling troopers scuttle away, and Sarah makes her way down the hill, with School Boy picking up his hefty weapon and following her. Rambo also trudges back to the jeep. At the bottom of the hill, rebels buzz about as smoke billows and some of the foliage is burnt. Sarah looks about her, and Rambo lingers at the truck, watching her. He then frowns and feels his left shoulder with his right hand, checking his wound, and the back of his hand is bloody. Sarah finds Michael crouching over a wounded man, and he looks up as she runs to him and flings her arms around him. He has a wound to his forehead, and his face is black with soot and grime, while Rambo watches them. Sarah and Michael embrace for a few moments, then he gently pushes her arms away and strokes her hair before returning to the wounded man. School Boy kneels over Lewis, and Reese over En-Joo's corpse. Sarah looks up the hill at Rambo, her face grimy with a light cut across her forehead. She looks at School Boy, who stares down at Lewis as he stirs a little. She looks at the corpse of one of the volunteers, who has bullet wounds in his chest. Michael looks up the hill and sees Rambo, raising a hand to him wide-eyed and frowning. Sarah's face crumples and she starts to weep as Rambo turns away, clutching his shoulder. John Rambo walks along a lonely road halfway up a hill in Arizona, U.S.A., which is decorated with scrubby green grass and utility poles stretching along the length of the road. His hair is neatly brushed and face clean, wearing a pair of dark boots, blue denims, and a khaki parka over a black T-shirt, with a khaki kit bag slung over one shoulder.",

Alison looks Sydney in the eye as they are seated in a restaurant, and Sydney's mouth hangs open. A snow-dusted black limousine draws up, and a man opens the car door for Sophie, who climbs out onto the street in a pink dress and a light pashmina. She poses for press photographers, and then Sophie and Elena leave Sydney alone. Sydney boogies on the dance floor, bouncing joyfully as he smiles and jives. Smiling suggestively, she wraps her arms around Sydney. Images from a moving car show tall palm trees and signs reading Hollywood and Beverly Hills as the limo sweeps down a main road, passing a billboard with an image of a pouting Sophie wearing a nun's habit. Stripped to his socks and boxer shorts, a terrified Sydney tries to gather the courage to leap between two high hotel balconies but hops back down from the railing. The hotel room is filled with the young, affluent, and beautiful, and Sophie unzips her blue dress, letting it fall to the floor. She hands Sydney her bottle of beer as she strides out onto the balcony in her bra and knickers, while the guests rush over to the adjacent balcony to watch. Smiling victoriously, Sophie stalks into the room from the adjacent balcony. Reluctantly, Sydney wrinkles his nose and snorts like a pig, hopping from one foot to another with his limp wrists held up to his chest. Drinking whiskey at the foot of his bed while half watching a monster movie on TV, he flicks through the channels and sees his mum. He drops the remote control and looks down at his bare hand as a handsome, Brill-creamed gent in a '50s movie slides an engagement ring onto Sydney's mum's finger, and she gazes love-struck into his eyes. Sydney is transfixed. A sleek black sedan arrives by a fountain outside the 53rd Annual Apollo Awards, and Sophie, Elena, and Sydney get out and head down the red carpet towards the entrance. Sophie is wearing gold with an ostentatious white fur stole and a long flowing red dress. Inside, she does an interview for the cameras while Sydney stands waiting nearby. Lawrence approaches, and Sydney's eyes rove in thought as the penny drops. He sits beside Sophie at the award ceremony as the woman onstage announces the winner, Sophie Maes. Sydney looks up from his seat to see that Sophie is wearing his mother's ring and lowers his eyes. The crowd applauds as Sophie makes for the stage, and he runs up behind her. Sophie charges and pins him on the table, and they fall to the floor. She slaps him while Richard watches on the hotel room TV, and the magazine models see Sophie kick Sydney. Alison chuckles to herself as she watches the debacle.",

The Brethren are firing at the Donovan party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. Two Nazi Soldiers throw hand grenades into the cliffs. They explode, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. The battle continues with a fierce exchange of gunshots, grenades, and machine gun fire, resulting in losses on both sides. Crouched behind a rock, they watch as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses. They look down at Kazim, who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. Elsa looks saddened. Kazim dies. Indy leaps atop a Turkish Soldier on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to the ground. A second Turk comes to assist his comrade; Indy mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to the ground. Brody has been left alone in the tank. Henry climbs down into the tank and taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him. Brody then tugs his ears, flaps his arms, and touches his head. They exchange a handshake. The Nazi Soldiers point their guns at Henry and Brody. Vogel removes a glove and slaps Henry with it. He slaps Henry again. Another slap. Vogel reaches out to slap Henry yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping him. Donovan appears at the turret cover. Indy and Sallah charge forward, leading their horses and camels. Then Vogel commands the Tank Driver to give chase. Vogel shouts to the Tank Driver. Henry and Brody are still held at gunpoint by the Nazi Soldier. The Nazi Soldier swings his fist, knocking Henry off his seat. Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. Vogel emerges and aims his gun at Indy. Indy and Vogel exchange shots as Indy chases the tank on his horse. Indy pulls the trigger again—his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail. Now Indy is above the tank, twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank. Hate-staring at Indy. Hate-staring back at Vogel. Suddenly, from nowhere, a German soldier flies into frame, tackling Indy. One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank, and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and swarm all over Indy. Indy presses the Luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top, and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.",
    "1360": "Nelec moves to the door, with his back facing Woodward, as Overmyer approaches the bed. We see Nelec's face, revealing his true nature. Joe sleeps as the power remains out. Then, there is a knock at his window, which wakes him up. He moves to the window, opens it, half asleep but stunned. Alice quietly climbs in, and Joe sits on the floor, with Alice joining him. There is a moment of odd silence, and Joe, amazed, stares at Alice. Suddenly, the power returns, and Joe's clock light comes on, while the projector starts playing a silent home movie of his mother. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it, but Alice moves closer to the screen, and Joe sits behind her. Alice is captivated by the film, and a tear falls down her face, unseen by Joe. He is quietly stunned, watching his mother. The Super 8 movie ends, and Joe turns off the projector, but a shudder-hum sound remains, coming from the cube Joe took from the crash site on his desk. Joe and Alice move towards it as the cube begins to vibrate slightly. Joe uses a paintbrush to touch the cube, which shudders on its own, and they are amazed. They get close to the desk, but the shuddering increases in pitch and volume until the cube suddenly bullets away, leaving a five-inch hole in the wall. Alice screams, and they both fall to the floor, stunned, as Joe's heart pounds. Joe moves to the wall, looks through the hole, and sees trees and the town water tower in the distance. Alice enters a dark house quietly, stepping carefully towards her room, tense and her mind racing, and she breathes deeply before leaving the house. She cries and rides off on her bike, passing a distant fiery glow over the hills. The front door opens, and Louis comes out, miserable, and yells after her. But she is already far away as Louis's mind races; he runs to his Buick, starts it up, and pulls out quickly to go after her. Alice pedals hard, wanting to escape, a block ahead of her father, who is clearly drunk as he drives. Alice makes a daring stop, turns back up the hill, and pedals hard, crying and hyperventilating.",
    "1224": "Ben takes a key from behind an upper hinge of the workshop door and glances over his shoulder at Duke, who sits nearby watching him. Ben unlocks the padlock, and Duke follows him into the workshop. He flicks a switch, and Ben gets tools out of his bag, setting to work on the machine. Stripped down to his vest, lithe, muscular Ben hammers a pin out of the machine, undoes a huge knot with an equally huge monkey wrench, and fits a new belt on the flywheel. Duke lies snoozing nearby, as Ben reassembles the machine. Ben leaves the workshop with Duke, who escorts him down the side of the house to the gate. Ben gets in his car and drives off, then takes a shower at the motel. Looking troubled once more, he stands beneath the fine jets of water and stares down deep in thought, experiencing flashbacks of running through the night, his face bloody. He stops running and sinks to his haunches. In his motel, Ben sits on the edge of the bath, staring down, bare-chested with a white towel wrapped around his waist. A flashback of a bloodied garment and an inert, blood-smeared hand lying on earth passes through his mind. A dream-like image of Sarah emerges: she's wearing a pink dress, smiling gently as she looks down at something and then walks away slowly from Ben's motel room bed and out of sight. Ben, dressed, lies on his back on the bed and watches the bald boy, Nick, through a window. Nick looks weak and is attached to monitors, with his mother reading to him while a nurse fills in a chart beside them. Ben is lying face down on an examination table as the doctor uses a large syringe. Ben buries his face in a pillow as the doctor extracts the bone marrow from his hip. Later, Ben limps slowly into the motel, where Larry is watering plants, but Ben ignores him and enters his room. Ben lies on his side in the motel room bed, with an unfinished plate of food on the covers, along with documents and handwritten letters, ignoring his phone. Ben's face is now stubbly; he's sitting up in bed, staring ahead somberly, then lies asleep on his side. His mobile flashes as it rings, and Ben's eyes open slowly. He stares at the mobile, which lies beside him on the bed, hesitates before picking it up, checks the display, opens the clamshell phone, and puts the phone to his ear. She cringes and looks hopeful as Emily breaks into an uncertain smile. She smiles and puts down the phone, and the home nurse gives Emily a questioning look.",
    "797": "Outside a door, a tall, blonde security guard is on duty and checks his watch. In a back room, Willie puts a sack down while Marcus points to an air conditioning vent. Marcus removes the cover from the vent, clambers into the duct, and crawls along it clutching a torch. In an office, a man looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it, and a woman working at her desk also looks up, along with a woman at the next desk who then turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and resumes her work. Marcus arrives at a vent and observes a security office filled with monitors, looks at the equipment, and makes notes on a pad. Meanwhile, Gin is having a pedicure and answers his phone. Roger Merriman, the kid's dad, is in prison, and Gin walks into the prison visitors' room where Roger, who is balding and bespectacled, is sitting. Gin nods his head and gets up as Roger looks confused. Willie cooks for the kid and Grandma, serves it up, spoons a dollop onto it, turns back to the stove to flip the bologna, and serves a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself, placing it on the breakfast bar. The kid heads off to get it, hands it to Willie, who gives it back to the kid struggling to open the door, which appears to have been stuck with excessive adhesive. Willie watches as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside. Bob is with Gin, who mixes and slurps a dose of Fibracell stool softener, grimacing as Bob winces. A bus pulls up outside the mall, and skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop. The kid sees them, hesitates, then walks down the street, with the skaterats following maliciously. They get him and grot him. The boy wanders off as Santa scratches his own ass, and the kid appears with his pants around his armpits. Marcus heads off while Willie looks at the kid, stares incredulously, shakes his head, and the kid just stares back before walking away with his underpants still around his armpits. Willie watches him go with a doleful expression and turns back to Marcus, who stares at him with a very deadpan expression for an elf. Gin is next in line, and Gin, Willie, and Marcus are in a bar, where Marcus shifts uneasily.",
    "635": "He walks tensely back to Graham, and Merrill and Graham turn and look behind them as something brushes past the swing, followed by an urgent rustling in the maize stalks beyond the swing that gradually dies away. The next morning, Caroline sits in the dining room with Morgan, who's holding her walkie talkie; Morgan nods, Caroline smiles warmly and nods back, and she grins. Bo sits in the adjoining lounge, watching cartoons as Graham walks over, and Bo does so. There are three glasses of water on the TV set. Caroline looks across at Merrill, who sits at the other end of the long dining room table, resting his head on his hand and looking up at her; Merrill grins at Caroline and absently rubs his finger on the table top while she shrugs. Caroline glances at Morgan, who's studying her walkie talkie, and looks back at Merrill. Graham walks across the lounge and spots three glasses of water on a small table, leans over, and picks them up. He stands upright and sees some more glasses of water on a nearby cabinet, then puts the three glasses back down and walks into the dining room, where he sits at the table by Merrill. She checks her notebook and gives them a patronizing look, and Graham looks tense and awkward; she nods. Graham shrugs, looks uncertainly at Merrill, blows out his cheeks, and Merrill looks at the ceiling, then holds up his hands and turns away in frustration. Bo comes into the dining room, taps Graham on the arm, and leaves, causing Merrill to shift awkwardly. Graham considers for a moment before Bo comes back, and Caroline looks up. In the lounge, the TV shows news footage of a corn field with a line of crop circles similar to Graham's, a man talks to the camera, 17 circles are scattered across a map of India, and footage shows people standing in some of the circles. Graham's steely blue eyes gleam as he stares at the TV while Morgan takes a puff of his inhaler and Caroline stands behind him. Graham and Caroline come out of the house, and as they stroll away from the farmhouse, she shakes her head. Caroline nods, opens the driver's door of her police car, smiles, gets in, and Graham stands and watches as Caroline pulls around an island of grass in the middle of a stretch of gravel and heads off down the driveway. Morgan and Bo sit in the back of a car, Bo points a finger at Morgan, and he brushes it away. Graham turns the radio off again, and in the driving seat, glances over his shoulder at Morgan, then turns back to the road as Morgan sighs wearily. An aerial view looks directly down onto a quiet freeway, which runs through a suburban part of town.",

He dials a number on the phone. He has another drag on the cigarette. He slowly raises the phone to his ear. A surveillance view of the city. In a park, Hoffman calls Ferris, who's walking through an airport terminal. On a residential street, Ferris and Skip get out of an SUV. They communicate through earpieces. Sadiki emerges from an apartment building. Ferris walks up and follows him to his car. They are watched by men in a white four-by-four. The four-by-four drives at them. Sadiki gets in his car. Ferris smashes a window. Sadiki drives away. Ferris and the attackers exchange fire. An agent drives the SUV after the four-by-four but crashes. Skip is thrown through the windscreen. Ferris keeps shooting. The attackers drive off after Sadiki. Skip lies on the ground covered in blood. Ferris feels for a pulse in his neck. He makes a call on his mobile. Sadiki sits on a chair in a shabby room. A man sits filming him. Al-Saleem's lieutenant pours a drink. He hands the drink to Sadiki. The lieutenant looks at Sadiki curiously. In another room, Al-Saleem watches the video footage of Sadiki on a small screen. Outside the city, a group of boys stand on a hillside. Further down the hill, some dogs mooch about. Sadiki lies dead amongst piles of rubbish. Skip lies unconscious in a hospital bed with a breathing tube in his throat. Ferris stands by the bed, staring at Skip. Ferris swigs from a bottle of soda. Ferris picks up a phone and sits by a window. Sitting on a terrace by a lake, Hoffman pulls out his earpiece and sighs. Ferris walks into his apartment and steps on an envelope. He picks it up and shuts the door. He walks into the living room. He puts his keys on the table and opens the envelope. He takes out a photograph of him and Aisha walking down a street. He stares at the photo. He looks around anxiously. Then, he picks up a bowl and hurls it at the wall. He storms out of the apartment. Aggressively driving through town, he calls Aisha on his mobile. A mobile on a table in Aisha's apartment rings. Ferris speeds along a street and stops. Ferris gets out and runs across the street. He holds out his hand and the car stops. Ferris slaps the bonnet and runs to Aisha's apartment building. He heads up the stairs with his phone pressed to his ear. Ferris slows up as he approaches a gate.",

Nema's grandma steadies a chicken and chops its head off. It is a winter hat. Yuri sits apart staring at a photograph of his ex-wife and the twins. Jackson joins him and hands him a flight jacket. Yuri glances at the women, and Jackson nods and raises his eyebrows. Gordon peers down the cockpit, descends steps in the Antonov, points his thumb upstairs, and climbs back up. Jackson and Yuri join him and Sasha in the cockpit. Through smoke and clouds, they see fire and mountain lava; Hawaii is devastated. The Antonov flies over the city as skyscrapers collapse and burn. On Air Force One, he enters the Presidential cabin, and she looks away from him. Nora smiles and nods. At night, a phone rings on the desk. A child opens a bedroom door, and a girl in slippers trots across floorboards. The child picks up the receiver; Tony is calling from the ship with a hand over one ear. Her father and mother sit up in bed as the daughter runs into their room. Husband and wife exchange glances. Tony studies her photograph and fights back tears. His son picks up the receiver and studies it, then looks back across the room where his Japanese wife stands with her arms on the child's shoulders. The room begins to shake. Tony hears the screams before the line goes dead. He hangs up and glances away. In Washington, President Wilson walks through crowds outside the White House as ash falls like snow. The injured are being treated beside ambulances. Wilson enters the West Wing; his clothes are covered in ash, and people stare at him. A fireman touches the brim of his hat, and a female paramedic jumps to her feet to salute him. He acknowledges her salute, then crosses to a woman with a small girl. Behind the woman is a couch; his secretary runs over. Outside, the ash continues to fall as crowds mill around. The medic looks up, and everyone looks around. The ground now violently shakes. Patients are being treated on gurneys that are alarmed. It splits open. The president, clinging to a drip stand, fixes his eyes on the tall pointed Washington monument. It sways and starts to fall like a felled tree. On Air Force One, all eyes turn to Laura. Adrian watches Anheuser. At Saint Peter's in Rome, the Pope leads the prayers of the faithful gathered in the square.

    "1248": "Andy follows instructions to stash the dry cleaning in the closet on the left before showing a book. She, Miranda, and the children giggle as Andy creeps upstairs, reaching an upper floor where she encounters Miranda and her husband. They catch sight of Andy trying to creep back downstairs, and Miranda glowers at Andy like a rabbit trapped in the headlights. Andy leaves the book on the top step and hurries away. Arriving for work, Emily grabs Andy's arm and pulls her into a side room, pointing to Miranda's office, and Andy reluctantly goes in there. Andy smiles nervously and heads back to her desk, while Miranda answers her mobile. Andy sets a tray on Miranda's desk, sprinkling herbs onto Miranda's steak, and Emily runs to fetch them, later having Miranda's coat and bag for her as she leaves. Andy carries the dishes into a side room and throws them into the sink before calling Nate. Andy stands on the corner in a dark green dress and gold accessories, then runs across the busy street, around the corner, and races up to the St. Regis, where a doorman in a morning suit greets her. She finds Christian sitting at the bar and takes the manuscript. At the appointed hour, she puts a hot coffee and the manuscript on Miranda's desk as the twins are reading them. Miranda turns away in her swivel chair, and Andy walks out with a smile, after which Miranda turns back to stare after her and snatches up the coffee. Nate gets home to find Andy painting a ball to look like a planet, and she hugs him, but he shakes his head. A black camisole, he then pulls her into a passionate embrace. Meanwhile, Nigel and his team are on a shoot by a lake in Central Park, with models in animal print outfits and masks, and a man with a live snake. Andy finds Nigel vetting one model, leaving her thoughtful. Miranda is in a meeting with senior staff, including Nigel, while Emily has a cold and hands something to Miranda before returning to her desk. Andy's mouth is shut as she is on her way out when her phone rings, bringing her back to Miranda's office with Emily, to which Andy nods. Albums are mentioned, and Nigel has a long black gown ready. City lights sparkle as Andy is driven to a benefit, exiting the car stunningly adorned in a chic black evening gown, hair swept up with white flowers. Andy spots Nigel talking to reporters, who spots her, giving a warm smile. She winks back, making her way past the press, along the red carpet, and up the stairs toward the entrance.",
    "413": "He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben, who writes his name on the card, stares at it for a moment, crumples it up, and fills out a second card. Ben reaches for the key and is handed the key. A waiter stands next to the table with a telephone as Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair to look through the glass into the lobby where Ben is in a phone booth no more than twenty feet away. Over Ben's shoulder, his face is reflected in the glass door, through which Mrs. Robinson is visible sitting in the Veranda Room. Ben hangs up, leaves the phone booth, walks back into the main lobby, and, as he passes the desk on his way to the elevator, starts to pat his breast pocket, making the desk clerk look up. He clears his throat and then kisses her. Ben opens the closet door as she turns her back, and he undoes the zipper at her neck. She turns and looks at him, leading him to back away and slam the bathroom door shut, causing the light in the room to disappear. The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool and on Ben, who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the pool, wearing dark glasses, deeply tanned, and holding a beer can in one hand. Ben opens his eyes and moves his head slightly as Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbecue fire and Mrs. Braddock approaches from the house carrying some ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil. Ben rolls off the raft, swims to the end of the pool, climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a chair, starts to put it on, opens the back door, and goes through. Ben has just shut the bathroom door behind him, wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers. PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson, who stands in front of the bureau taking off her bracelet and watch. He moves to a chair and sits as Mrs. Robinson kneels in front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt. Behind Ben, the door that leads from the Braddock den, where Ben is sitting, reveals Mr. and Mrs. Braddock in the dining room, having dinner and looking through the doorways toward Ben. Ben stands, crosses back to the den door, shuts it, and returns to the chair to sit. A television set facing the chair is on as Ben picks up a can of beer and drinks from it.",

Outside, Homer shoots up the police car as another police car arrives down the block. Red waits in his car as the robbers exit with four hostages. Down the road, lawmen aim rifles over the car's hood. Dillinger and his men, using their hostages as shields, cross to the getaway car. Dillinger aims at the police over the president's shoulder, and an officer fires first. Homer aims his automatic rifle, and with Dillinger, they shoot up the other police car, taking out a couple of lawmen. Their car speeds off with Dillinger and Homer on the running boards with their hostages. As they drive down the street, the tails of the crooks' overcoats flap in the breeze. The car comes to a stop under a bridge. Dillinger faces Homer's hostage, and the two hostages run off. Dillinger notices his young hostage shivering, wraps his overcoat around her, and guides her into the backseat. Red drives off. In the car, Dillinger hands the teller his hat. The car heads down a dirt road leading toward a forest of leafless trees. Homer sits next to the young teller. Pete cracks up. Now in the woods, they tie the president and the young teller to a tree. The bank robbers leave their hostages and stride out of the trees. Reaching their car, they get in and drive away. Now, in a marble hearing room, a square-jawed man faces a committee and tilts his ear toward the chairman. The mustached senator looks Director Hoover in the eye, and Hoover whispers to a bespectacled man. Hoover marches out with the bespectacled Suydam and a slender young man. As they walk down a hall, Suydam takes notes. Hoover looks to his young associate. Now a fedora sits on a burgundy leather couch by Purvis, who gazes off thoughtfully. As Hoover exits a nearby office, Purvis stands. They cross an FBI bullpen and step onto a sunny veranda, where reporters gather. Hoover faces a microphone and motions for Purvis to take his place at the mic. Purvis squints decisively at the reporters. Now at his supper club, Dillinger grins as he dines with his friends. He checks his watch and looks toward the door. Rubbing the tip of his nose, he shifts his gaze to the dance floor where a brunette in a red dress dances with a man. Dillinger keeps his eyes fixed on her. His attention shifts as a scrawny guy with glasses approaches. Dillinger stands and shakes his hand. The scrawny Alvin takes a seat beside Dillinger and leans close.",
    "711": "In an animated scene, city lights glow behind giant letters on a cliff surrounded by shining spotlights. In sepia-tone film footage, people wearing early 20th-century clothing stand on a dock, waving toward the massive ocean liner, the RMS Titanic, while passengers on board the moored ships doff their hats or wave back. Surrounded by inky darkness, a pair of small bluish-white lights glow and grow brighter as revealed to be deep-sea submersibles approach and disappear as they sink into the dark ocean depths. Later, the subs creep just above the ocean floor, lighting up a small expanse of pale sand. A triangular shape appears on a sonar screen, revealing the prow of the sunken ocean liner ahead of the submersible. A brown-haired man cranes his neck, staring out of one of the submersible portals as one sub rises over the tapered bow and railing, which are covered in a growth resembling drippy, gray concrete. The sub's bright lights shine over a thick chain lying across a ship's deck as it moves forward, stirring up clouds of sediment with the second sub following close behind. The brown-haired man films himself with a camcorder as he stares out the window at the wreck and smiles at a bearded crew mate. Both subs glide off the wreck and illuminate twisted metal shapes encrusted with grayish growth, passing alongside upper balconies running down the side of the ship. The man sets down his camcorder as the subs descend toward the wreck, with lights illuminating rectangular windows with panes of broken glass. A crewman operates a remote control with a joystick, guiding a small robotic vehicle attached to a tether from the sub. Duncan enters a hole in the ship's side and films a door with an ornate leaded glass window, gliding past the door powered by a small propeller. Outside, the other sub releases a second remotely operated vehicle, Snoop Dog, which descends into an open pit in the ship's hull, moving through an opening. Its bright lights illuminate a crystal chandelier, still dangling from a ceiling, as it glides up a corridor past a partially decayed boot lying on the sediment beside a pair of eyeglasses missing one lens. Nearby, a porcelain doll's face juts out of the silt. Snoop Dog's lamps shine into a bunk room with a broken door on the floor beside a dilapidated bed frame. The bearded crewman stares into a visor as he pilots Snoop Dog through, while a pale eel slithers through the water as Snoop Dog approaches an elaborately carved fireplace surround and a mantel. One of the robotic explorers shines its lights on the rotted remains of a grand piano.",

The Mercedes pulls away, followed by the motorbikes. Video footage shows Diana in a swimming costume in the sea, while the Mercedes is pursued by four motorcyclists, each with photographers riding pillion. Archive footage shows a younger Diana driving away from reporters, and a younger Diana smiling as a photographer snaps her picture. Now, six motorbikes gain on the Mercedes, and on the ski slope, Diana reaches out to mask a photographer's lens. Her hand blocks out the sunlight as a tunnel looms ahead of the Mercedes.

Outside in the darkness, Robin hurriedly approaches Balmoral Castle, rushes down a corridor bustling with people, puts on a black jacket while walking, and rushes up some stairs with a dark-haired woman close behind. Robin stops outside a door while the woman walks up to it. The Queen looks up from her bed and switches on a bedside lamp, with Prince Phillip sitting up beside her. The Queen exits the bedroom, and Robin bows, then turns to Cherie in bed. Charles enters the room where the Queen Mother, Phillip, and The Queen are present, then turns and leaves. Robin approaches a blonde woman, picks up a phone from a nearby desk, and later slowly ascends some stairs while the royal family watches television. Robin enters the room but stays by the door, and Charles stands in a dark room with Steven, rubs his brow, and Steven backs away.

The Queen walks down a dimly lit corridor, peeks through a doorway to see Charles talking to Prince William and Prince Harry, and as Charles sees her, he leaves the room, moves to reenter, and she extends her hand briefly before retracting it. Charles stops, his eyes well with tears, and the Queen casts her eyes downward. The Queen walks down a corridor and addresses a footman, then later sits at a desk and writes in a book.

As the number ends, he bends her over in his arms. Peter's cold black eyes settle on Mary Jane who looks devastated. Gwen follows his gaze and turns to him in shock. She gives Peter a reproving look and crosses to Mary Jane who's standing motionless behind the microphone. Gwen pushes her way past Peter. Mary Jane hurries from the stage. Peter, looking uncertain, puts his hand to his chest. He comes up behind Mary Jane with a hostile scowl. She turns to face him with scorn in her eyes. Peter pins a bouncer against the wall and starts beating off two more. He lashes out, sending Mary Jane careening to the floor. His vicious expression turns to wide-eyed shock as he realizes what he's done. His eyes well up, then he glances down at the Black Spider-Man suit under his dark open-neck shirt. Covering the suit with his hand, he turns away from Mary Jane and hurries out into the night. Mary Jane, still sitting on the floor, looks around helplessly. Out in the rain's wet street, Peter, keeping his hand clasped at his collar, steps into a doorway to think. Drawn by the sound of the bells, he looks up as the torrential rain pours down. A flash of lightning illuminates a Gothic church with a tall studded spire topped by a stone crucifix. The storm clouds slowly drift away, leaving a lowering gray sky. Perched high up on the studded side of the steeple, black-suited Spider-Man looks at his hand, flexes his fist, then drops from his perch like a bird shot from a tree. He plummets down to a square archway, leading to the bell tower of the imposing cathedral, decorated with an intricate network of Gothic arches and flying buttresses. Inside the cathedral, Eddie Brock dips his fingers in a font of holy water and crosses himself before the altar. Up in the bell tower, Spider-Man claws at his mask, desperately trying to tear it off. It tears and stretches like rubber then snaps back like a second skin. He falls against the bell in a struggle. For a second, the mask seems to disintegrate then snaps back into place. Brock looks up at the sound. Peter pulls up the mask, ripping it across his contorted features. The black threads of the Symbiote sticking to his face like bulging veins. As if in a trance, Brock is drawn to the screams of his nemesis, pushing open a door that leads to a staircase winding around the walls of the bell tower.",
    "91": "The scene begins with a focus on their regular breathing and snoring, followed by the woman stirring and reaching for the phone, which she then hangs up. The man stirs, clears his throat with a long deep rumble, sits up, gazes around, and clears his throat again. There are remains of a large breakfast plate. A wider view shows Marge in a beige police uniform with a heavy belt carrying a revolver, walkie-talkie, and other police items, while Norm is in a dressing gown. Marge struggles into a parka and makes her way down the icy stoop to her prowler, hearing the front door open off-screen. She stamps the snow off her shoes and approaches the scene from her squad car, where two police cars and an ambulance idle by the road with men inside. A figure in a parka emerges from the first car with two styrofoam cups, handing her one. Marge looks around as they walk, peers into a car, looks up from it, around at the road, and at the prowler parked nearby. She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees, calls up to the road, and then is on her hands and knees by a body in the ditch, examining footprints. The foreground shows a state trooper's head as Marge, still on her hands and knees, peers at it. She claps snow off her hands, climbs out of the ditch, and looks at the idling prowler. Marge drives while Lou sits next to her, gazing out the window. Meanwhile, Jerry and Stan, wearing parkas and galoshes, stand near beached vehicles as Wade waits in an idling Lincoln and taps the horn for Stan, who then gets in. Jerry stares at his laptop. Elsewhere, a lakeside cabin is surrounded by white as a brown Ciera with dealer plates pulls into the drive. Grimsrud and Carl exit the car, with Grimsrud helping Jean out from the back; her hands are tied and a black hood covers her head. Jean cries out, escapes Grimsrud's grasp, and lurches across the lawn as Carl, grinning, stops Grimsrud from retrieving her.",

At night, as the community sleeps, one man stands guard. By a railway line in daylight, Gramov places a playing card on top of a detonator and slides it under the rail, explaining to Zus. He removes the card, inserts a knife blade into a hole in the detonator, and turns it, causing Zus to nearly jump out of his skin. Zus picks up the detonator and goes, and Gramov retrieves his playing card and follows him. At the camp, Shimon is giving a chess lesson, and Asael scowls at Arkady. Bella and Asael look across at Chaya, who appears carrying a basket. Asael takes a glug of the confiscated vodka and goes to meet her. Chaya smiles and lowers her eyes as Asael's lips part but no sound comes out; Asael nods and exhales, and shyly she takes his hand. Later, Shimon officiates their wedding as snow billows and a German truck crawls on a snowy track. The Russians line wait, and when Shimon nods, Tuvia steps forward with a ring. Asael tends to Chaya, who has a shawl over her long, loose hair, and takes her hand. He kisses his young bride as the onlookers smile, and Commander Panchenko gives the signal. Standing under the chuppah, Asael stamps on a glass, and the Russians let go. Germans fall on mountains, and at the wedding, people start to dance. Tuvia hugs Asael in the woods as Zus leads the onslaught. A young couple dances, and Zus fires on a truck. Tuvia joins the circular dance, smiles across at Lilka, and Zus sets a bomb under the truck. Tuvia finds Lilka as the dancers surge into the middle. Dead Germans are searched, and two officers, kneeling, await their fate. Zus comes up behind them and shoots them both in the head. Chaya, in a chair, is lifted up to shoulder height and twirled around. Panchenko addresses Zus as he walks by. Chaya and Asael are both held aloft by their well-wishers, who jig up and down in a huddle. Together, the young couple holds the napkin wrapped around the glass Asael crushed with his foot. Deep winter has set in at the Naliboki Forest Camp. A table and bench are blanketed in snow, and a wheelbarrow stands marooned. Frozen washing hangs heavily on the line, and a woman breaks the ice that has formed in a bucket of water. Next to her, Chaya ladles out some soup to a long line of people, as Asael, standing in a gutter nearby, holds up two potatoes. Tuvia looks around at the ashen faces of the people queuing up for food.",
    "1136": "The lights come on in the hall, and they close the front door. Gray smoke rises from the tiled floor in the long narrow corridor ahead of them and swells towards them. A ghostly Dumbledore appears, his hand reaches out, and then the face disappears as the smoke dissipates. They freeze, but Hermione steps forward and raises her wand. Harry dreams of Voldemort threatening the wand maker, Ollivander, and then wakes from his dream to find himself lying fully clothed on a sofa. On a sofa opposite, Hermione is still asleep, her left hand hanging over the edge almost touching Ron's hand, as Ron sleeps on the floor between them. Harry hauls himself upright, using the glowing tip of his wand to light the way, and mounts a staircase, his shadow cast on the wall. He turns the handle, pushes the door open, and stands in the doorway as light floods in through a dusty window. Inside the room, he pulls a cord, causing two skeletal bats to flap their bony wings as he looks around. On top of a chest of drawers, he finds a dusty old book and looks back at it. Hermione enters another room, which is a mess with a mattress falling off the bed, while Ron indicates the name of the door. Harry reads the message in the locket and, hearing a noise, they turn towards it. Harry gets up and cautiously crosses the room towards a door in the corner, yanking it open to reveal a house elf. Harry holds up the replica as Kreacher stares at the locket before he disapparates. Meanwhile, the Hogwarts Express puffs its way across a barren landscape, and in the train, Ginny sits with Neville Longbottom. Death Eaters fly over the engine, and a dark figure stands on the tread, halting the train. A student, Cormac, confronts the Death Eaters as they walk through the carriages, and Death Eaters approach Ginny and Neville. Dressed in pink, Dolores Umbridge stands beside Pius Thicknesse as a man is dragged towards the new Minister. Mundungus sells stolen property, and upon seeing a group of snatchers, he scurries away taking shelter in an alley where the reward posters of Harry, Undesirable Number One, are pasted on the walls. Hermione plays while Ron watches her with puppy dog eyes; she glances at him and he tries again. Harry stares at the Snitch fluttering in front of him, and Hermione joins him. He takes hold of the Snitch, causing its wings to fold, and stares at the Golden Ball as they all look round. Harry and Hermione run past Ron into the kitchen where Kreacher has Mundungus round the head and Dobby clings to his leg. They close in on Mundungus, who sees a photograph in a newspaper on the floor, picks it up, and puts it on the table, while outside, a city street with stone buildings is shown.",
    "538": "Elliot stops walking to browse through some books, then turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle, looks at the book, and he hands it to her. She thumbs through it, and later, Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out. A taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it, and Elliot opens the rear door for Lee. She laughs as she gets in. As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway. Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark, then turns on a light. The camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry Lee next reads. The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts. Upbeat jazz begins to play, and the film cuts to the facade of Mount Sinai Hospital. A few cars whiz by as the film moves inside to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam. First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched-over Mickey sitting in a glass booth, wearing a set of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it. A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk. The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey sitting on the other side of his desk.",
    "533": "Lamps hang down from the ceiling as classical music still plays in the background. Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area, where Frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen. As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag. Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him. The table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment. Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs. Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out of the work area. Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks. Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf and leans back against the unit, glancing through its pages. Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee with his hands in his pockets. The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's bedroom area. He sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off his shoes. Lee sits down next to Frederick; he takes her hand. Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek, and they embrace. Frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter. Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues walking. As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up to Mickey. The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen. As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses. The fast-tracking group turns the corner as Gail pats Mickey's back and gestures in exasperation. Mickey is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there. Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel. A writer, holding a script, walks out of the background studio, looking around. Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten with this new crisis. Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor adjacent to the studio. The writer reacts angrily as Gail tries to get Mickey's attention while they walk. Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer and stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror. People mill in the background behind the actor as Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room with Gail following him. Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron as they share a drink in a paper cup.",
    "244": "The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in there, back and forth. A waitress comes by with a pot of coffee and pours the young woman's coffee. The young man lights up another cigarette, calls to the waitress, then looks to his girl. The waitress comes by, pouring him some more. The young woman scans the restaurant with this new information and sees all the patrons eating, lost in conversations, and the busboys going through the motions, collecting dishes. A smile breaks out on the young woman's face, and with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up, and rob the restaurant. In the front seat are two young fellas, one white, one black, both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Jules is behind the wheel. They close the trunk. Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. We track alongside. They enter the apartment building, walk through the reception area, and wait for the elevator. The elevator arrives, the men step inside, and the elevator doors open; Jules and Vincent exit. Steadicam in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall. Jules stops Vincent, looks at him a long moment—he's been set up. He starts walking down the hall, Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind. They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering, making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head. Jules just looks at him. Three young guys, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries, and soda pops laid out. One of them flips the loud bolt on the door, opening it to reveal Jules and Vincent in the hallway. The two men stroll inside. The three young caught-off-guard guys are Marvin, the black young man, who opens the door and will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner, and Brett, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. Vincent and Jules take in the place with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking. Jules grabs the burger and takes a bite of it. Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, and pulls out a black snap briefcase. Vincent looks up at Jules, closing the case. As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and shoots Roger, blowing him out of his chair. Vince smiles to himself. He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding. Brett can't say a word.",
    "421": "In the movie, a man stops to look at his hands and realizes the casts are off. He knocks on a door with his wrist as if the casts were still on. When the door opens, he holds up his hands boyishly, and a woman kisses them. Eddie flexes his fingers and tries a shot on Johnny's pool table, using an open hand bridge for support, as Bert Gordon enters and watches him play, smiling at Eddie. Later, Eddie and Sarah enter a quiet, elegant restaurant with soft piano music and subdued lighting, a place they passed on the day they first met. Sarah wears a new dress, while Eddie, looking a little uneasy, wears a suit and tie. The headwaiter seats them, and they exchange smiles. A waiter approaches, and Sarah suddenly laughs. The waiter returns with a bottle of sherry for Eddie's approval, leading to a long pause before Eddie responds. The waiter pours the sherry as Eddie and Sarah stare at each other over their glasses, until Eddie looks away. Sarah proposes a toast, and they touch glasses. The waiter brings the check, and Eddie nods, drinking the last of his brandy as the waiter leaves. Sarah notices Eddie's somber demeanor and, picking up her purse and gloves, she leaves. It is raining heavily as Sarah emerges from the building, leaning wearily against the awning. Eddie quickly pays the bill and follows her, catching up to take her by the arm and stepping out to hail a cab. Sarah angrily breaks away and walks into the rain, but Eddie pulls her back under the awning, and they enter a building, both drenched. She walks to a chair, limping noticeably, and he reaches over to pull her close, burying his face in her head. Bert Gordon leans on a cab, his expression dropping at the sight of Eddie and Sarah approaching. Eddie carries two suitcases and a leather cue case, setting the suitcases on the curb for the cab driver to take. Bert courteously opens the taxi door, and Sarah eyes Bert distrustfully as she gets in. Eddie, Sarah, and Bert then squeeze through the door of a train compartment as a redcap exits with their luggage, and Eddie shuts the door, with Bert and Sarah sitting across from each other.",
    "14": "He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now, and he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins. Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face. He crosses off. Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink. The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room. Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, laughing too loud at their jokes. Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want. Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued. Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused. They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This situation is loaded and they both know it. Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel, smoking a joint. Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large catering boss in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint. He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs. Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance. Lester quickly hides the joint behind his back, and she goes back inside. Jane and Angela are watching MTV. Jane switches off the TV. She starts toward the kitchen. Lester enters and opens the refrigerator. He turns, and is instantly transfixed by: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair. She starts toward him. She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. Extreme close-up on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in slow motion. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything slows down, and all sound fades. Close on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a rose petal from his mouth right before we. Jane glances at Angela, irritated. Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer. Carolyn enters from the dining room. He can't believe what he's hearing. Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door.",
    "1290": "Students bustle into the classroom as the teacher, Mr. Tinker, tries to maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk, sets down her bag, looks up, and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner, Bleeker. Her girl lab partner stalks off dramatically. Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper depicting a distraught teen girl clutching her head. She smacks the phone a couple of times. A health teacher in slow motion puts a condom on a banana. We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering; he's comically wide-eyed with shock. Juno, her father Mac, her stepmother Bren, and Liberty Bell sit at a typical kitchen table, eating dinner. Mac shovels food while chatting about his day. A pile of neglected cacti festers in a corner of Juno's room. Bren is cutting up Liberty Bell's food diligently, with her brilliant nails holding the silverware. Bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog. Bren's nail salon is in full glory as she chats up a customer and applies a fresh coat while speaking in her strong city accent. Liberty Bell blithely pours bacon bits onto her dinner. Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic and recognizes the protester as a classmate. She continues toward the clinic entrance, considers the situation, and pushes open the clinic door. The receptionist sits behind bulletproof glass. Juno flashes jazz hands, and the receptionist raises an eyebrow and arranges paperwork on a clipboard, handing it with a pen and holding up a fistful of purple condoms from a clinic jar. The semi-crowded waiting room is occupied mostly by pregnant women, teens, and ill-behaved children. The receptionist points to the paper, motions for Juno to look, and Juno scans an ad silently. The ad contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous smiles. We see Paulie’s bedroom window with childish curtains and the light on inside. Bleeker lies on his car-bed in his track uniform, listening to the same LP from when he and Juno were intimate, and stares at Juno's yearbook photo, which has a sloppy handwritten message from her. Bren and Mac are predictably speechless when Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings. Bren looks alarmed as Juno hastily attempts to legitimize the situation. Music plays, and we see sparse images of Vanessa Loring’s hands preparing her house for Juno's arrival, sprucing a vase of flowers.",
    "798": "Marcus leans forward and glances at Willie, rubbing his chin thoughtfully as Gin gets up from the table and leaves. Marcus and Willie regard each other, with Willie resignedly resting his head on his hand while Marcus slips into a brooding silence. The next day, a very large queue of excited children and their mothers forms at the western-themed Christmas Corral Grotto. A semi-comatose Santa lies on the escalator clutching a broken bottle as Marcus, back in elf guise, tries to calm the kids. At the top of the escalator, Santa drunkenly gets to his feet and lurches slowly towards the grotto, bumping into one of the kids as he does so, before keeling over and collapsing on top of a fake cactus and a sack of presents. The kids and moms gasp as Santa rallies and gets on his feet, only to fall over a life-size model donkey, falling on his back and seeing a second donkey going over. He scrambles to his feet and slugs the donkey with a big right hook, knocking its head off, then punches and kicks the donkey's body to bits in a display of drunken violence. The moms hurriedly usher their offspring away as Gin strides up, drops Willie, and drags him away. Later on, Willie is back at the kid's house in the garage, sitting in Roger's BMW with the engine running, having run a hose from the exhaust pipe into the driver's window to commit seasonal suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. The kid walks into the garage, sees Willie whose head lolls to one side as he inhales the noxious fumes. The kid walks over to the car and looks in through the driver's window, and Willie moves slightly, raising his head a little to look at the kid. The kid turns to leave, and Willie winds the driver's window down, handing the kid a letter and noticing the kid has a black eye. Later, Willie is smashing into the chief skaterat's face and then turns to the rest of the gang. Two other kids on bikes watch astounded as Santa administers the festive beating. Back at the mall, Marcus and Willie are in the locker rooms after a hard day dishing out presents; Marcus gets changed out of his elf gear while Willie, in a contemplative mood, sits on a bench and sucks on a bottle of gut rot.",
    "1217": "There is light on the riverbank as Michael's party stirs and lights hang from the soffit of a dock house on the distant riverside. Michael, Sarah, and the party crouch low in the boat as it nears the building, where a group of pirates sit on a veranda overlooking the river. The volunteers wear worried frowns, but the boat's passage past the pirates appears to go unnoticed in the dark. Michael glances worriedly at Rambo, whose gaze does not waver from the pirates as the boat leaves the pirate dock behind. The volunteers move up the boat en masse towards Rambo, and Michael steps up to him. Suddenly, a floodlight is cast from a motorboat and a warning shot is fired as the boat bears down on them, with the pirates armed with a machine gun on a tripod. Sarah pulls on a white floppy hat as Rambo stands with his arms raised in surrender. The pirate motorboat pulls alongside them, and pirates in vests and bandannas cast ropes with grappling hooks over to Rambo's boat. The hooks catch and lock, as a floodlight plays on Rambo's face and a pirate brandishes a pistol. Rambo throws a switch and turns the lights on, then turns a gun on Sarah. The pirate leader turns his gun back on Rambo, who sees a pistol tucked into a second pirate's waistband. Rambo pulls a gun from his pocket and shoots them, the pirates dropping to the deck of their boat in slow motion. One of them is only wounded and reaches for his gun, but Rambo stands on his hand, aims at him, shoots him in the head, and turfs the corpse overboard. He grabs Michael by the throat, then releases him and throws a grappling hook over the side. He and Sarah grab the tiller as she stares at him desperately, placing her slim hand on his beefy forearm, her eyes wide and brimming with tears. Michael looks away disgustedly as she rejoins the group, who appear very subdued. She sits next to Michael, who holds her in his arms, as Rambo fires up the boat's motor with a sullen glare and adjusts the tiller. The boat plows through the river water, with the floodlights of the now derelict pirate boat touching their departing stand as it motors into the inky blackness. A bright sunny day follows as the boat is steered towards a riverbank with a simple harbor beneath a large, spreading tree overhanging the water. The volunteers stand up in the boat, collect their belongings, and begin to disembark while local peasants act as porters nearby. Rambo watches the volunteers leave, the last of them being Michael and Sarah. Michael rounds on Rambo, then gets off the boat and walks away up a wooden gangplank.",
    "696": "Peter takes a cookie and pulls a face as he drinks his glass of milk. Later, he struts and jives down the street like John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever, drawing a pitying glance from a slender Black woman passing by. In Jameson's office, Peter stands very close to Betty and sneers before sitting in Jameson's chair, helping himself to a bowl of sweets, and putting his feet up on the desk with a supercilious smile, while Robbie and Jameson look at him dumbfounded. Out on the street, Peter jives down the road, making shooting gestures with his fingers at any pretty girl who walks by, then swaggers into a clothes shop and comes out wearing a sharp black suit and black open-neck shirt. On the pavement, he launches into another hip-thrusting '80s dance routine, receiving strange looks from people on the street who hurry by as he coolly strides away. On the outskirts of the city, water from a sewer outfall drops into a pond, where a line of bubbles cleaves the water, leaving a trail behind that is followed by a muddy figure made of sand materializing on the swampy bank and hauling itself upright. As the figure dries out and becomes human, Flint stares at his hands, with Penny's photograph dangling from a locket and chain from his fingers, and gazes at the tiny image with eyes filled with resolve. Later, Peter is with Gwen, and Brock watches bitterly as they cross the street towards the jazz club. Gwen looks around as Peter spots Mary Jane waitressing and beckons the hostess, slipping her a wad of money, gallantly gesturing for her to sit down while he sits behind her, facing the on-stage back. Mary Jane goes by with a tray of drinks, and Gwen notices Peter glance at her as Mary Jane puts down her tray and hurries onto the stage. Peter glances at Gwen out of the corner of his eye, slips away to the stage, and just as Mary Jane is about to sing, he comes in on piano. Gwen looks up and realizes it's Peter playing the piano as he kicks away the stool, leaps onto the piano, and dances over the tables, grabbing a martini from a customer, swinging across the room on a chandelier, putting his legs around the chair, and sliding back across the dance floor, scattering customers. He drops to the floor, spins the chair, and poses with it before dancing towards Gwen, ripping his black suit jacket off his shoulders, causing her to gasp. He tosses the jacket towards Mary Jane on stage and strikes a series of poses, clicking his fingers and salsaing over to Gwen, holding out his hand. She takes it and rises to her feet as Mary Jane looks devastated when he leads Gwen into the center of the dance floor.",
    "527": "Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette, and the camera follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray. Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park. The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain-link fence a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side. It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm. Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence. He flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering. Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears on a black screen. A bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay. Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. The concerto stops, and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance. People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps. Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah. Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette. She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to guests crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall. The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group. The guests laugh appreciatively. A woman comes over to Evan and hands him some wine. He laughs; the guests laugh with him. The guests continue to laugh; they are charmed. Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music. Some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen Evan.",
    "1157": "Harry invades Snape's memories and sees him unhappy, humiliated by his father. Back in the storeroom, Snape, with his face twisted with anger, grabs Harry viciously and peers into his face. Harry cowers and runs from Snape's room, hearing crying in the corridor and finding the twins comforting a small boy while Umbridge stands watching them before she goes. During the O.W.L. exams, the great hall is set out with long rows of desks as Hermione writes busily, Ron sighs and looks worried, and Harry watches Umbridge standing on the stage in front of a huge swinging pendulum. Her smug smile fades as several students turn to look at the door, and Umbridge strides purposefully down the hall towards the great wooden doors. Everyone stops writing and turns to look as Umbridge opens the door, where a fizzing firework hovers in front of her nose and explodes inside. She looks anxiously around the empty hallway when suddenly Fred and George hurtle over her head on broomsticks, zooming backwards and forwards while flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The multicolored fireworks spiral down and explode, scattering papers everywhere, with Goyle getting a firework in his face, Crabbe a whiz bang up his backside, and another attacking Draco as Filch rushes in. One of the twins gives a signal, and his brother flings a large firework into the air, which explodes into a fiery dragon that heads for Umbridge, causing her to race for the door. The dragon bursts out after her, destroying the decrees Filch has nailed to the wall, as frames clatter down in a shower of glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George fly from the building, swooping over the battlements on their broomsticks and flinging fireworks. Delighted students rush into the courtyard, applauding, while Professor Flitwick looks confused and a huge fiery letter W appears in the sky. Ron smiles with pride, Professor Flitwick punches the air, then looks around self-consciously as Harry's face grows pale and he collapses in slow motion. Hermione notices him fall as he is overwhelmed by an image of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Sirius gasps, his face contorted with pain, as Harry sees the number 97, the glass sphere, the black corridor, and the blue door. Hermione kneels beside him anxiously, looking at Ron before they enter Umbridge's study, where a white cat leaves his China plate through a cat flap. Harry throws flue powder into the fire as Draco drags in Neville, Umbridge leans over Harry, and he looks at Ron and Hermione.",
    "1344": "In a modest Ohio house in 1979, Charles, in an ill-fitting black suit, and Martin, dressed in a shirt and tie, are at the buffet. The scene includes forty-odd friends and neighbors dressed darkly, engaging in quiet discussions, with some crying on a grey, snowy day in early February in Lillian, Ohio. Many cars are parked outside, including a Sheriff's Department squad car in the driveway. Joe, dressed in a too-big black suit, solemnly sits on a swing set, holding a locket. He looks up when a distinct 1968 Buick GSX, a yellow muscle car with a black racing stripe, arrives. A man in his early 40s, wearing jeans and a work shirt, exits the car. Joe watches carefully as Louis moves to the house and inside. Joe's focus returns to the locket as tears fill his eyes, but the moment is broken by raised voices from the house. The sound of breaking glass follows, and the back door bursts open, revealing Joe's father, Jack, leading a handcuffed and in-pain Louis Dainard to the squad car. Their eyes lock briefly, but Jack, visibly uncomfortable, drives away. Joe watches them depart, looks back at the locket, and finally closes it. As winter becomes a memory, hundreds of kids celebrate leaving their last day of school. Girls emphatically embrace goodbye while boys run off happily. Charles, red-faced, hands Joe pages, and they head to the 7-Eleven. Cary, with a burn wrap on his arm, joins them as they scan the candy aisle. Joe nods at a magazine while a hectic family scene unfolds at Charles' house: his mother cooks, his sister Jen angrily sets the table, his father pays bills, his sister Peg works on a puzzle, and twin 9-year-old boys bicker over an action figure, as the TV plays a Match Game in the living room.",

She tries to deep throat it, and Pete loves it. Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna, looking very happy and refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each other as they pull up to their house, shut off the car, and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world and not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end. Sadie walks outside, followed by Jodi. Charlotte is crying really hard and sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to Dr. Seduku, a foreign doctor with both an accent and a lisp. Pete cycles with the crew while Debbie looks around the house for Pete. Debbie sees Pete on the bed, with his legs up in the air. He still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down, trying to look at his back end while holding a mirror and an iPhone. Pete has his naked legs hiked up over his head, and Debbie takes a very quick glance inside. Debbie talks to Jodi while they fold clothes and watch Desi. Debbie walks over to Desi, who picks a shirt and begins to take all her clothes off in front of Debbie. Debbie squeezes Desi's breasts. Pete is in his office on the phone with his REALTOR. Sadie and her friend Wendy run around the yard with Charlotte and the triplets. Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen. Larry picks up one of the triplets, and Charlotte leaves with the triplets. Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out. Wendy exits, and Sadie runs off. Pete enters from the hallway, sees Larry, and turns around before anyone notices him. Pete and Debbie are in bed, and Pete is reading Sadie's iChats on her confiscated iPad out loud to Debbie. They hear a door slam, and Debbie gasps. Debbie starts looking through the iPad. Pete's iPhone chimes, and he sees a message from Ronnie from work. He looks over at Debbie, who is oblivious. Pete paces. Pete is driving while Sadie and Charlotte sing show tunes loudly and happily. Pete is very upset about the record not selling as Debbie talks to their ACCOUNTANT. Pete enters and walks into Ronnie's office, where Ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk. Pete walks out of Ronnie's office and into the main office space, and Ronnie follows. Debbie sits in Dr. Pelligrino's office, and then she drives away. We cannot tell what she is feeling, but after a few beats, a joyous smile appears across her face.",
    "1058": "An empty carriage arrives at Longbourn, and as it pulls to a halt, the footman opens the door, allowing the Wickhams to emerge from the house, surrounded by Lydia's sisters and parents. He ushers Lydia into the carriage, which then pulls away as Lydia leans out of the window to wave a cheery goodbye to her family. Later, Lizzie and Jane are taking a turn in the gardens, with the bright sun beating down on them, while indoors, Mary practices her piano and Kitty is busy decorating a straw bonnet with ribbon until she stops, looks wearily at the bonnet, and tosses it away. Mrs. Bennet is lying back on a chaise lounge in her room, fanning herself and ordering the servants about, while Mr. Bennet sits peacefully by the fire in the parlor, reading a book and sipping a glass of wine. Lizzie, now in her room and in her nightgown, sits in front of the mirror, gazes sadly at her reflection, and then leans forward to blow out the candle. It is a bright, sunny day when Mrs. Phillips comes to visit her sister, Mrs. Bennet, at Longbourn, and a horse and cart filled with trunks pulls up at Netherfield. Inside the house, shutters are opened and smoke pours out of the chimney as the fires are lit, while a procession of servants troop inside, carrying baskets of food and provisions. Mr. Bingley is out shooting, and they are in the kitchen, hanging up bunches of herbs. Lizzie looks at her sister while Mary is at the piano, and as Mrs. Bennet scurries over to the window, Jane tries to hide her excitement. Lizzie breathes deeply as Mrs. Bennet checks her reflection in the mirror, swiftly taking a seat as the housekeeper shows their guests in. Jane and Lizzie look nervous as the two gentlemen enter and bow. Everyone takes their seats, except Mr. Darcy, who strolls over to the window and smiles at Jane. Mr. Darcy continues looking out the window as Lizzie glares at her mother with embarrassment. The two gentlemen are now on their horses, riding away from Longbourn, while Jane and Lizzie take a stroll in the gardens and continue on their walk, with Jane looking somewhat sheepish. At Netherfield, Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy emerge from the front door, and astonished, Mr. Bingley watches as Mr. Darcy climbs into his carriage. As the carriage pulls away, Mr. Bingley immediately looks around for the nearest servant, and then he is on horseback, trotting through a shady avenue of trees on his way to Longbourn. She bursts into Lizzie's room, and afterward, an awkward-looking Mr. Bingley is sitting opposite Lizzie, Kitty, and Jane in the parlor.",
    "19": "She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way, and he gulps at the contact, since no one else ever touches him, but covers his self-consciousness. She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could read Melvin, which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. The two waitresses signal their protests as Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper, hanging near their table, and his discomfort builds in this limbo. The Woman starts to protest. There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction—that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear the table. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her, and Melvin senses that he's gone way too far. A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing, backing down. She walks away, and Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room sofa, each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in. The Young Man stops and looks at her, and pulling herself together, she goes off down the hallway. She takes off her headphones when she sees Carol, then hears the cough. Carol now goes into her son's room, which is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights, with two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing contraption), a waste basket, a nightstand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit, stacks of seven-year-old toys, and a small TV wedged into the tiny space. Carol feels his head, and then he coughs, trying to suppress it. She brings up a waste basket as he throws up and she comforts him. He apologizes. As she re-enters the living room, he is taking a cigarette from a pack, palms the cigarette, and resumes making out. His hand squeezes her breast, then he stops and looks at his hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste. She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth. Seeing the Hustlers, he leads the way back toward the studio, chatting away unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment. He turns and sees the naked model as Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes. Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy Simon. Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive, and Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes as he feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation. There's a joy in him at this moment—a bit of purity. Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar.",
    "315": "She giggles and snuggles into him, and though he's grateful for her affection, he still looks uneasy. The phone rings and he automatically answers it. Evan smiles to himself and hugs her tighter. The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their clothes covered in dirt, food, and what might be vomit. Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor Theta Chi pledge wears as a hat. As she takes a step toward the table, flower petals shower down on her. She looks up to see two more pledges standing on ladders, delicately tossing petals. Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down. Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely, and they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever. Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time, and Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks. Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill. Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off, and the steering wheel sits on the roof. The most unnerving thing, however, is a spiked leather dog collar that hangs off the rearview mirror. By now a crowd has gathered, and she stares at the collar. Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. He then locks the door, reaches into his desk, and finds a tiny canister of Pepper Spray. Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs, and Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face. Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with his free hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad. Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs and raises the tire thumper for a final attack, swinging down off camera. Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother, and sirens come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body. A security vehicle pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison. The vehicle stops, and Evan, along with nine other convicts, exits in leg and hand restraints. Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters the General Population area of the prison."
