    "6": "Ricky strides into view, his presence immediately noticeable. Lester, visible only from the waist up and appearing unclothed, casually drapes his arm around Ricky while handing him money. With his hair drenched from the rain, Ricky pockets the cash. Lester's arm stays around Ricky's shoulder as Ricky grins, then squats and reaches beneath the weight bench. Meanwhile, Lester settles into a bowl chair, leans back with his hands behind his head, and watches as Ricky begins to roll a joint. From the Colonel's viewpoint, Lester is seen reclining in his chair. We observe only Ricky's back and shoulders as he expertly rolls the joint. The Colonel's expression hardens.\n\nLester's jaw drops, then he throws his head back, an action that from our angle strongly suggests Ricky is performing oral sex on him. The Colonel watches, his disbelief evident. The sound of a car approaching draws the Colonel's attention; Angela's BMW rolls into the driveway, coming to a stop behind Lester's Firebird. Angela and Jane hurriedly exit the car and rush toward the house, yet our attention shifts back to the garage window. Ricky, standing now, looks somewhat panicked. Lester quickly pulls on his T-shirt, and together they move out of sight.\n\nJane and Angela enter the scene. Jane's expression sours upon seeing Lester, who nonchalantly leans against the counter, striving to project an air of coolness and succeeding to a notable degree. Jane, unimpressed, rolls her eyes and leaves. Angela approaches Lester, her touch on his arm flirtatious as she looks up at him with a confident smile, expecting to unsettle him. However, Lester's demeanor has shifted; he is no longer intimidated. He meets her gaze squarely, leans in, and returns her smile slowly, his voice low and intense. Feeling suddenly insecure, Angela withdraws and quickly departs. Lester watches her leave, his expression one of bewilderment.\n\nRicky reenters, soaked from the downpour, and moves to his bureau, extracting a wad of cash from his pocket as he goes. Suddenly startled, he turns to find the Colonel emerging from the shadows. Without warning, the Colonel strikes Ricky with a backhand so forceful it sends him sprawling across the floor. Ricky rises, his eyes locking onto the Colonel. In this moment, he realizes a way to break free from his father's control, astonished at how simple it was. Grabbing his backpack, Ricky turns and exits, leaving the Colonel standing, his eyes glazed and his breath heavy.\n\nEntering another room, Ricky finds Barbara in the center, clutching a dish, her face etched with fear. She has clearly overheard the altercation with his father and gazes into Ricky's eyes, searching for understanding, acutely aware that a significant moment is unfolding. Ricky gently kisses her cheek before slipping out the back door, leaving Barbara alone, still holding her dish.\n\nFrom the Colonel's perspective below, Ricky is seen dashing through the relentless rain to the Burnham's front door, where he knocks, eager to find refuge from his tumultuous home life.",
    "8": "In the charged atmosphere, they stand in silence. He exudes sexiness, while she feels unnerved by the rapid unfolding of events. She attempts seduction clumsily as she speaks. His face draws near to hers. Angela takes a deep breath just before Lester leans in to kiss her cheek, her forehead, her eyelids, and her neck. Lester then kisses her on the lips.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn drives with a resolute expression on her face. Back at the scene, Angela reclines on the couch as Lester positions himself over her. He removes her jeans and tenderly strokes her legs before moving up to caress her face. In another room, Ricky and Jane, fully dressed, lie curled up on Jane's bed. She appears detached from the unfolding events.\n\nLester begins to unbutton Angela's blouse and eventually pulls it open, revealing her breasts. He looks down at her, a grin spreading across his face, filled with disbelief that his long-held fantasy is about to become reality. Suddenly, Lester bursts into laughter. His grin fades as he gazes at Angela lying beneath him, looking embarrassed and vulnerable. It becomes clear that she is not the mythically carnal creature of his fantasies, but a nervous child. Lester's expression falls. He reaches for a blanket from the back of the couch, gently draping it over her shoulders to cover her nakedness. He smiles and shakes his head. Humiliated, Angela begins to cry. Lester embraces her, allowing her to rest her head on his shoulder, stroking her hair and rocking her gently, though she continues to cry.\n\nElsewhere, the Mercedes drives onto Robin Hood Trail. In the car, Carolyn's eyes are visible in the rear-view mirror. She turns her head to see the red door of the Burnham house, which stands out even in the pouring rain.\n\nBack at the house, Angela, now fully clothed, sits at the kitchen counter eating a turkey sandwich. Lester turns to her, raising an eyebrow. They share a long, studying look before breaking into smiles. Angela then leaves, and Lester watches her go, feeling unexpectedly content. His gaze shifts to something on the edge of the counter, and he reaches for it. He moves to the kitchen table, sits down, and picks up a framed photograph. The photo, taken years ago at an amusement park, shows him, Carolyn, and Jane looking startlingly happy. Lester seems older and more mature as he studies the photo. A deep, satisfied smile spreads across his face, as if he finally understands an old joke's punchline. After a moment, the barrel of a gun rises behind his head, aimed at the base of his skull.",
    "1": "Jane awakens, sitting up and gazing directly at the audience. The scene transitions to a sweeping aerial view, descending gently over suburban America toward a street lined with trees. Inside a luxurious bedroom, Lester Burnham is seen sleeping face down on a king-sized bed, enveloped by costly linens and clad in pajamas.\n\nSuddenly, the silence is shattered by the shrill ringing of an alarm clock. Lester, still groggy, fumbles in an attempt to silence the incessant noise. With a resigned sigh, he rolls over, looks up at the camera, and then sits up to slip on his slippers. He steps into a hot shower, the steam enveloping his face, and through the fogged glass door, his silhouette is visible, engaged in a private moment of masturbation.\n\nThe camera focuses closely on a single, dewy American Beauty rose. A gloved hand, equipped with clippers, deftly snips the flower off its stem. Outside, Carolyn Burnham meticulously tends to her rose bushes in front of the Burnham residence. A woman in her early forties, she sports a well-coordinated gardening outfit and utilizes an array of sophisticated, expensive tools.\n\nLester, meanwhile, spies on Carolyn through the first-floor window, peering between the drapes. In the adjacent yard, a dog barks incessantly, prompting a sharply dressed man, Jim #1, to scold the animal. Another similarly attired man, Jim #2, emerges from the house. Lester continues to observe as Jim #1 approaches the fence to converse with Carolyn, neither aware of Lester's watchful eye.\n\nJane is at her desk, absorbed in her computer work when a car horn blares outside. She hastily gathers her belongings, examines her reflection in the mirror, and adjusts to better view her profile. With her backpack slung over her shoulder, she exits the house. Lester, briefcase in hand, rushes out the door but fumbles, causing his papers to scatter across the driveway. He kneels to retrieve them, trying to salvage the situation with a sheepish smile, while Carolyn looks on with a mixture of contempt and boredom.\n\nThe family piles into the car: Carolyn drives, Jane gazes out the window, and Lester dozes in the back seat. At his workplace, Lester is seen at his desk, surrounded by a sea of identical beige cubicles. He's on a headset phone, his face showing frustration despite the light-hearted tone of his conversation. Brad, a stylish man in his thirties, approaches unnoticed and watches Lester. After ending the call with clear irritation, Lester turns, offering a forced smile. Later, Lester finds himself in Brad's spacious corner office, seated across from him, feeling dwarfed and isolated.",
    "10": "Brad, poised to escort Lester out, stands firmly as Lester, feeling helpless, stares back at him. Next to the Burnhams' residence, a moving van is parked in front of a colonial house. Carolyn drives the Mercedes-Benz into the Burnham driveway, with Lester seated beside her. As they exit the vehicle, Carolyn surveys the movers next door who are busy carrying furniture into the house. Carolyn then proceeds indoors, followed by Lester.\n\nThe Burnham family—Lester, Carolyn, and their daughter Jane—gather for dinner illuminated by candlelight, with a vase of red roses adorning the center of the table. During the meal, Lester abruptly turns to Jane, prompting her to look at him as though he's lost his mind. Carolyn observes this interaction intently before rising and heading to the kitchen, leaving them behind. Lester becomes aware of Carolyn's critical gaze upon him and remains silent, his focus fixed on his plate. He then rises, taking his plate with him, and follows Jane to the sink where she is rinsing off her dish. Upon Lester's entrance, Jane turns to face him, awaiting his next move. Lester seeks some form of connection, but Jane, unsettled by this sudden intimacy, is unable to respond. Viewed through greenhouse windows, their conversation appears strained.\n\nJane places her dish in the dishwasher and exits the kitchen. The camera follows her departure and then quickly returns to Lester who calls out to her from inside. Through the kitchen window, a video captures Lester at the sink, muttering to himself as he rinses his plate. The camera focuses on Ricky Fitts, an eighteen-year-old with eyes that betray a maturity beyond his years and a hidden wound beneath his serene facade. As he records with his Digicam, Lester turns off the faucet and looks out the window, noticing that Ricky, who had been standing there moments before, has vanished. Ricky's head suddenly jerks up, his gaze meeting the camera as if he's aware he's being watched. Lester dries his hands, tosses the towel onto the counter where it lands beside a framed photograph of a younger Lester, Carolyn, and Jane at an amusement park, and exits the room.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn, with intense focus, engages in household chores: cleaning the glass doors that overlook the patio and pool, scrubbing countertops, dusting a cheap-looking ceiling fan in the master bedroom from atop a stepladder, and vacuuming a carpet that seems perpetually dirty. After her cleaning marathon, Carolyn stands in front of a mirror, now wearing her suit again, meticulously applying lipstick. Throughout her tasks, she silently repeats a mantra to herself. She also takes time to neatly arrange her sales materials on a desk before stripping down to her undergarments, revealing her meticulous nature in both her professional and personal spaces.",
    "11": "Carolyn critically examines her reflection in the mirror, her gaze intense. She utters a statement that sounds threatening before noticing a smudge on the mirror and quickly wiping it away. The front door swings open, and Carolyn appears with a broad, persuasive smile, welcoming visitors into the home. She guides a couple in their thirties into the living room; they seem weary after viewing numerous houses that day. The room is dim, and the couple, unenthusiastic, surveys their surroundings. The woman's face wrinkles in skepticism.\n\nShortly after, Carolyn ushers in another couple, this time in their fifties. Following them, she introduces yet another couple to the house, an African American pair in their late twenties, with the woman visibly pregnant. Carolyn then stands by the pool with two women in their forties. She moves to secure the sliding glass door and begins to close the vertical blinds but pauses mid-action.\n\nFrozen in place, with the shadows of the blinds striping her face, Carolyn's composure breaks as she begins to cry with brief, involuntary sobs. Suddenly, she slaps herself forcefully, yet the tears persist. She slaps herself again, and again, continuing until the tears cease. Composed once more, she takes deep breaths to regain control, then firmly pulls the blinds shut, resuming her professional demeanor. She exits the room calmly, leaving it dark and empty behind her.\n\nThe scene shifts to a high school basketball game, where teenage boys engage in a vigorous match. A team in pale blue and white uniforms scores a basket, prompting cheerleaders to jump excitedly as the crowd cheers wildly. In the bleachers, near the high school band, a group of about twenty teenage girls dressed in similar pale blue and white uniforms sits. Among them, Jane is seated next to Angela Hayes. At sixteen, Angela embodies the quintessential American dream girl with her striking beauty, perfect features, blonde hair, and youthful figure.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn drives with Lester slumped beside her in the passenger seat. She looks at him, uncertain how to react.\n\nBack at the school, the uniformed girls now stand on the gym floor in formation, performing a dance routine. Lester and Carolyn find seats in the crowded stands to watch. The girls execute their moves well, though their youthful inexperience shows in their ambitious Vegas-style performance. Lester spots his daughter Jane among them, performing with focus. Next to her, Angela dances awkwardly. Suddenly, Angela turns to face the camera, her smile lazy and insolent.\n\nThe focus shifts solely to Angela. The music begins to echo eerily, and a slow zoom towards Lester shows him watching, completely entranced. The lighting intensifies around Angela, causing the other girls to vanish entirely. Now alone in the stands, Lester remains spellbound. Angela, now dancing exclusively for Lester, looks directly at him. Her dance becomes overtly erotic; she unzips her uniform, her expression a mix of innocence and knowing allure.",
    "15": "Lester, on the brink of implosion, continues to listen intently. Overwhelmed, Jane covers her ears and begins to sing loudly to block out the noise. Suddenly, her singing ceases. In a state of panic, Lester rushes down the hallway. Meanwhile, Angela moves to the window and gazes outside. We see her standing there in her underwear, peering down at us from across from Jane's window. As we zoom in closer, Angela poses, yet our focus clearly remains elsewhere. The camera finally rests on a small make-up mirror, reflecting Jane back at her computer.\n\nIn the darkness, Ricky sits with his digital camera, capturing video. Jane smiles on the screen, but abruptly, the drapes close, and her image vanishes. Ricky lowers his camera, a smile playing on his lips, until something below catches his eye. Through a window on the side of the Burnham's garage door, Lester, still clad in his suit, frantically searches the shelves at the back wall, as if his life depended on it. Suddenly, the sound of someone attempting to unlock a door breaks the silence.\n\nQuickly, Ricky pulls the drapes shut and turns on a light, revealing his room—a sanctuary of high-tech equipment. A state-of-the-art multimedia computer dominates his desk, while high-end stereo and video equipment, along with hundreds of CDs, line the shelves. The room's contents easily total twenty thousand dollars. Ricky opens his door to find the Colonel standing there, eyeing him closely, a small plastic cup with a cap in hand. The Colonel then walks away down the hall. Ricky, smiling, shuts and locks his door. He places the plastic cup on a shelf and heads to a mini refrigerator in the corner, retrieving a cup-sized Tupperware container filled with frozen urine from the freezer. He sets it on a saucer to thaw overnight.\n\nAs Carolyn lies asleep, Lester lies awake, staring at the ceiling. Carefully, he rises without disturbing her and heads to the bathroom. The room is enveloped in steam. Confused, Lester looks around until his gaze settles on Angela, lying in a pedestal bathtub across from him. Rose petals float on the water's surface, modestly covering her naked body. Like a man in prayer, Lester kneels by the tub. Angela arches her back and looks up at him provocatively. Lester stares intensely at her, then slowly reaches into the water between her legs. Her eyes widen in surprise, and she throws her head back.\n\nClose by, Carolyn lies in bed, her eyes wide open, listening to the rhythmic brushing sound of Lester masturbating under the covers. She turns to face him, then, feeling repulsed, gets out of bed and leaves the room.",
    "17": "Carolyn sits at a table, deeply engrossed in her thoughts, with two menus laid out before her. Moments later, Buddy Kane, known as the Real Estate King, joins her at the table. Instantly, Carolyn's demeanor shifts to warmth and graciousness. She smiles, genuinely touched that he remembers her name. Mechanically, she picks up her menu, yet her eyes remain fixed on him, captivated as if in the presence of a divine figure.\n\nElsewhere, Ricky stands with his DIGICAM, capturing footage of a decomposing DEAD BIRD on the ground. Suddenly, the camera jerks upwards, revealing Jane and Angela staring directly at the lens. Angela struggles to suppress a laugh as she looks at Jane, before falling out of frame. The camera zooms in on Jane as Ricky lowers his Digicam. Angela starts to walk away, but Jane remains still. Ricky smiles at her, prompting Angela to stop and stare at Jane in response.\n\nMeanwhile, Carolyn and Buddy are caught in an intimate moment, engaged in sex. In a different scene, Lester drives his TOYOTA CAMRY through the streets, smoking a joint. He turns down the stereo's volume and pulls up to a drive-through window where a teenage girl with a headset waits. Lester pays her and as she hands him his food, he spots a sign in the window's corner.\n\nLester then sits at a booth across from the manager, a young man in a greasy white short-sleeve shirt adorned with the Mr. Smiley's logo. The manager, looking puzzled, reviews Lester's job application. Back with Carolyn and Buddy, they are now in bed post-sex, sharing laughs. Carolyn, eager to learn more from Buddy, sits up. She quickly responds to his cues and kisses him, ready for another round.\n\nRicky and Jane walk together in silence. Ricky seems at ease, but Jane appears uncomfortable. As they walk, a funeral procession of cars slowly passes by them, and they watch attentively.\n\nIn another scene, Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, her gaze distant as if in a trance. Ricky enters the room, followed by Jane. Barbara's eyes flutter as she slowly turns to acknowledge him. Jane scans the surroundings; the room is immaculate, with glass cases filled with guns lining the walls. Ricky approaches a built-in cabinet behind the desk, unlocks it, and opens it to reveal shelves packed with war memorabilia. He gently removes an oval China platter from the cabinet and hands it to Jane for her to examine. Upon closer inspection, a small swastika is visible imprinted on the bottom of the plate. After Jane looks it over, Ricky places the platter back into the cabinet and closes the door, noticing Jane's peculiar look towards him. He studies her in return.\n\nThe scene shifts to an empty parking lot on a cold, gray day. Across from the viewpoint, an empty, wrinkled white plastic bag floats by.",
    "18": "A woman abruptly turns to face the hallway, her initial sweetness instantly replaced by repulsion. She quickly reverses course and retreats into her apartment, shutting the door behind her, leaving the hallway empty.\n\nMeanwhile, a man named Melvin exerts all his effort to coax a small dog into an elevator he's holding open. The dog, however, remains fixated on sniffing a spot on the carpet. As Melvin allows the elevator door to close, he advances on the dog, which has been ignoring him. Just as Melvin lunges to pick up the dog, it lifts its leg, causing urine to spray the wall momentarily before Melvin decisively lifts the dog.\n\nThe dog, sensing a connection, begins to growl and bark, even snapping at Melvin. Unfazed, Melvin, quicker and more ruthless, clamps the dog's snout shut and opens the garbage chute door. Without hesitation, he stuffs the dog into the chute and releases it.\n\nAs this occurs, another apartment door opens, releasing the sounds of a party and revealing Simon Nye, a man in his early thirties, who quickly dashes into the hall. Melvin, about to enter his own apartment at the far end of the hall, notices Simon and starts walking toward his door, which is directly across from Simon's. He sees his black friend, then notices the Handyman, who is struggling to hide his amusement at the situation. Melvin barely reacts to a loud knock at his door, bursting from his chair to open it. He looks demonic as he throws the door open.\n\nSimon, hearing Melvin, steps back. Melvin then returns to his apartment but is interrupted by Simon's sudden burst of courage before he slams the door shut. Frank, watching affectionately, then turns serious. As Melvin jerks his door open again, Frank quickly grabs him by the shirt and pulls him forward. Melvin appears both scared and impressed by the encounter.\n\nLater, Melvin navigates a crowded, dirty street with a brisk walk, clearly anxious yet trying to mask his fear. He moves through the crowd, occasionally placing his palms together and extending his arms to clear a path, meticulously avoiding cracks on the ground.\n\nIn a different scene, Carol Connelly is engaged in conversation with another mother, a customer, recounting a familiar story about her son. The mother nods with exaggerated sympathy, but Carol cuts her off. They then turn away as Melvin approaches a waitress station where two waitresses, Lisa and Carol, are talking.",
    "22": "In a bustling diner, four robust transit authority officers share a meal in a corner booth. Across the room, Cheryl examines his utensils intently. The manager approaches, gesturing confidently towards the officers, indicating he's in control of the situation. All eyes then turn to Melvin, who, feeling the weight of the officers' presence, assesses his dire circumstances before standing up. From a nearby cab, Melvin observes the vibrant slices of community life: men chatting in front of a bar, parents giving their child a ride on a mechanical horse outside a local store, and two young women animatedly discussing dating.\n\nAs Melvin arrives at Carol's landing, she opens the door for him. She is holding a container with ice, washcloths, and a thermometer. Melvin, ignoring a direct question, responds to an accusation he assumes she might have been thinking. Spencer, watching silently, just stares at him. Carol, visibly frustrated, closes the door in Melvin's face and then guides her son back to his room. The camera moves closer to show mother and son sitting on the edge of Spencer's bed. Carol carefully holds a digital thermometer to his ear as they both count down the seconds in anticipation.\n\nMeanwhile, Carol and her son settle into a car and drive off towards the hospital. Upon entering, Carol's dog, Verdell, lies just inside the front door, whimpering softly for Melvin. In another part of town, Jackie sits opposite Simon in his wheelchair, occasionally consulting and shuffling index cards on her lap. Despite their conversation, Simon struggles to keep his focus on Jackie, while nearby, Verdell, increasingly distressed, walks out onto the terrace and looks off into the distance before hiding behind a chair. As Jackie glances at him and reaches for a card, a tall, attractive woman nods, visibly irritated, before waving and leaving.\n\nElsewhere, Melvin waits as Zoe gathers her courage. The sound of an elevator fan is jolted as its doors open and close. Carol, appearing depleted and exhausted, approaches her home but suddenly grows wary. Her pace quickens into a run as she bounds up the stairs, fumbling with her keys at the apartment door while a strange, prescient whimpering escapes her. Upon entering, her worst fears are confirmed; she moves down the narrow hallway, adrenaline surging through her like an elk on the opening day of hunting season.\n\nBeverly, Carol's mother, enters the room, her mood ebullient as if that were her natural state. Her presence adds a saving grace to the tense atmosphere. As the scene shifts, we see a doctor and Carol seated at a small table, facing each other. Carol exchanges a knowing look with her mother, and they share a laugh, though Beverly struggles to stop. In another location, Simon, determined, practices walking with the aid of his cane. A tearstained Nora hugs him goodbye, her belongings in hand as she knocks on Melvin's door. Melvin opens it to find Nora still sniffling from her emotional farewell.",
    "23": "In the opening scene, a man forcefully shuts the door in a woman's face, leaving her momentarily stunned. She regroups after a brief pause outside the door and continues on her way. Meanwhile, in another location, a mother and daughter engage in a heated argument following the departure of their doctor. Elsewhere, a man, grappling with pain, hope, and anxiety, responds to a situation.\n\nSimon, confined to a wheelchair, abruptly wheels away from Melvin, tears streaming down his face as Melvin stands frozen in an awkward pause. Suddenly, Simon swings his arm and cast towards Melvin in a surprising attack, jolting Melvin, but the real shock comes when Melvin tries to escape to the door, only to be blocked by Simon. Amidst this, Verdell watches Simon with a look of concern. As Simon struggles to stop crying, Melvin shifts uncomfortably. Simon's mood shifts dramatically; he becomes enraptured by something.\n\nCarol, lying on a pullout sofa, rises and makes her way to the kitchen, trembling as she drinks a glass of water before leaving. She crosses into Manhattan, appearing as if she's heading to an important exam with no knowledge of the subject matter. On a hot summer night, she disembarks from a bus just as rain begins to pour, soaking her thin summer dress, which clings to her body as she consults a slip of paper for an address. Upon entering a building, she passes Simon's door, her wet dress now resembling the iconic image from the movie poster of The Deep.\n\nShe proceeds to Melvin's apartment, twisting nervously before knocking. From behind the door, Carol hears muffled throat clearing as Melvin unlocks it. Quickly, she grasps the fabric of her dress and pulls it away from her body just as Melvin opens the door, his hair statically charged and standing on end, occasionally patting it self-consciously. An extraordinarily long silence ensues between them. Melvin undergoes an intense internal struggle, battling the urge to scream or cry, processing sudden and stunning hurt, before turning away slightly and answering Carol hoarsely. Carol, in response, is both amused and surprised.\n\nAs time passes, indicated by two digital clocks on Melvin's nightstand, he rises from bed, performing a ritual of tapping each foot on the floor twice before proceeding to knock on Simon's door, which opens quickly. Simon, in pain, walks back to a chair before rising awkwardly and exiting, leaving Simon puzzled and concerned.\n\nElsewhere, Carol sits, diligently working on a letter to express her gratitude, surrounded by an enormous pile of completed pages.",
    "33": "Rick settles at a table in the cafe. As he converses, Captain Tonelli and Lieutenant Casselle stride past him towards the cafe's entrance. The overhead light flickers, casting intermittent shadows across Rick's face. Lieutenant Casselle is incessantly talking, while Captain Tonelli listens intently. They pause to salute Renault before entering the cafe. Rick chuckles softly at the scene unfolding before him.\n\nSuddenly, the BUZZ of a plane taking off from the nearby airfield catches Rick and Renault's attention. They look up to see the aircraft soaring directly overhead. Rick's gaze remains fixed on the direction of the airport, his expression somber.\n\nThe trio then enters the cafe, passing by Sam who is playing the piano. Rick gives Sam an affectionate pat on the shoulder. His eyes betray a reaction, involuntarily darting towards the gambling room, a movement that Renault notices. They proceed upstairs to Rick's office, passing Casselle who continues to harangue Tonelli.\n\nInside the office, Rick accesses a small, dark room adjacent to it and opens the safe. Only his shadow is visible as he retrieves the money. Emerging from the shadows, Rick hands the money over to Emil, who then leaves. Rick closes both the office door and the safe, under Renault's watchful eye. They sit down to discuss the situation seriously, with Rick's facial expressions conveying his feelings. Renault stands abruptly as his aide enters, prompting him to rush out. Rick's smile is laced with cynicism.\n\nRenault approaches Carl before moving to one of his officers, who salutes and heads off to speak with the guards. As Rick descends the stairs, Renault joins Strasser at his table and takes a seat. At the roulette table, Ugarte stands, unaware of the two gendarmes approaching from behind. Upon the officer's nod, they follow Ugarte to the cashier's window where he exchanges his chips. Looking around, Ugarte's actions are observed by Strasser at his table.\n\nGuards and gendarmes swiftly move in, seizing Ugarte. Rick remains impassive as they drag him away. The atmosphere in the room is charged with tense anticipation. Rick moves to the center of the floor and speaks with a remarkably calm voice, even as some customers contemplate leaving. His glance towards Sam prompts a nod from the pianist, who begins to play.\n\nRenault, Strasser, and Heinze, having observed the arrest, sit calmly at their table. Rick passes by, stops, and joins them. He nods to Strasser and Heinze before sitting down with them. Major Strasser, a key figure contributing to the Third Reich's notorious reputation, pulls out a small black book, flipping to a specific page.",
    "38": "Annina joyfully dashes towards him and embraces him warmly. As he turns his gaze, he spots Rick across the room. At the bar, Carl leans close and murmurs something into Sacha's ear. In a friendly gesture, he kisses Rick on both cheeks. Carl then skillfully pours a brandy and hands it to Rick. Feigning indifference, Rick subtly casts a glance towards Ilsa. Renault then approaches him. With a smile, he turns and walks away. Laszlo then steps up to Rick, prompting both to rise from their seats. Laszlo looks at Rick, his expression puzzled. Both Rick and Laszlo are suddenly alerted by male voices singing below. Standing at the balcony outside his office, Rick observes the Germans below. From his spot at the bar, Renault watches the scene unfold with a raised eyebrow. Laszlo, his lips tightly pressed, listens intently to the song before descending the stairs. Yvonne, seated at a table with her German officer, gazes somberly into her drink. Laszlo approaches the orchestra and speaks to them. Passing by Ilsa's table without stopping, he heads straight to the orchestra. The orchestra members glance towards the stairs, seeing Rick, who gives them a nod of approval. As the music begins, Laszlo and Corina sing together, their voices rising. Strasser, in an attempt to overshadow them, conducts the German singing vigorously. Eventually, Strasser and his officers, unable to continue, sit down defeated. Overwhelmed, Yvonne leaps up and joins in the singing, tears streaming down her face. Ilsa, filled with pride and emotion, watches Laszlo as he sings with intense passion. The entire cafe rises to their feet, their faces illuminated with joy as they sing along. The song concludes on a high, triumphant note, leaving Yvonne's face radiating with exaltation. She shouts at the top of her lungs, deliberately turning towards the alcove where the Germans are watching. Several French officers quickly surround Laszlo, eagerly offering him a drink. After a moment of thought, Renault sharply blows a loud whistle, silencing the room as all eyes turn to him. A murmur of discontent ripples through the crowd. People start to get up and leave the cafe. Rick hurriedly approaches Renault, visibly taken aback by his display of boldness. The croupier emerges from the gambling room and approaches Renault, handing him a roll of bills in a manner that is both abrupt and cordial. As the cafe slowly empties, Strasser makes his way to Ilsa. She looks at him, fully aware of his intentions. He bows respectfully and leaves just as Laszlo arrives at the table. Together, they exit the cafe and walk towards their room. Upon entering, Laszlo switches on the light. As Ilsa removes some of her jewelry, Laszlo moves to the window and looks out into the dark street. Across the street, under an arch, a man stands watching. Laszlo observes him for a moment before pulling down the shade. He then walks to a table, selects a cigarette from a box, and lights it with a match. Ilsa, now visibly uncomfortable, moves to the couch and takes a seat.",
    "40": "TEX meticulously examines a list, then folds it and tucks it into his pocket. They complete their task with the items from the bag. After ending her call, she turns to face JEAN-LOUIS. REGGIE follows JEAN-LOUIS's pointing finger to the top of the towering armoire. She then drags a straight chair over to the armoire and climbs onto it.\n\nDespite not being tall enough to see over the edge, she stretches onto her tiptoes, her hand reaching blindly over the top until she feels around and eventually pulls down a rectangular black bag, roughly the size of a trombone case. As REGGIE steps down from the chair, JEAN-LOUIS dashes to the door, unbolts it, and races into the hall, with the camera following his swift movement. JEAN-LOUIS bursts into the corridor, shouting.\n\nDYLE emerges first from GIDEON's room, while TEX steps out from REGGIE's, followed by GIDEON. The three men rush past JEAN-LOUIS and cram into SCOBIE's room simultaneously. Inside, they find REGGIE repositioning the small, straight black chair to its original spot. Their eyes fix on the case, displaying a mix of surprise and slight embarrassment. Slowly, TEX closes the lid, and the men avoid eye contact, including REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS by the door.\n\nSoon, the men exchange looks. Hastily, the trio brushes past REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS and exits the room. DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON, with REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS trailing, cross the hall to DYLE's room. DYLE turns the key that remains in the door, enters first, followed by the rest. Inside DYLE's room, DYLE, TEX, and GIDEON stand centrally, scanning their surroundings, while REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS linger in the open doorway.\n\nThe room resembles the aftermath of a cyclone, yet there is no trace of SCOBIE. The sound of running water emerges from behind the closed bathroom door, and DYLE notices water leaking from under it. Inside, SCOBIE lies face up in the full bathtub, still wearing his raincoat, his head submerged and water overflowing. His face is distorted. DYLE reaches in and turns off the water.\n\nDYLE, TEX, and GIDEON face the camera. A close shot reveals SCOBIE. The camera then swiftly focuses on a maid, her eyes widening in horror as she realizes the man is dead, and she lets out a scream. A close shot of GRANDPIERRE follows, who then raps his desk to call for silence. During the ensuing pause, he surveys each face intently.\n\nLater, REGGIE and DYLE stroll along the quai beside the Seine, having just passed an ice-cream wagon at the corner of the Pont au Double.",
    "41": "DYLE shrugs nonchalantly as he stands outside the Cathedral of Notre Dame. Suddenly, a woman thrusts an ice-cream cone towards him with such force that it dislodges, landing precariously close to his lapel, right over his outside breast pocket. As the scene shifts, REGGIE and DYLE step out of an elevator into a hotel corridor.\n\nEach heads to their respective room. Inside her room, REGGIE fixes her hair in front of a mirror before approaching the door that connects to DYLE's room. She unlocks her side, tries to open it, but it remains stubbornly locked. Disappointed, she knocks. Through the closed door, DYLE calls out to her as he empties his pockets. He starts to unlace his shoes but is abruptly interrupted by REGGIE's scream.\n\nReacting quickly, DYLE rushes to the connecting door, slides back the bolt, and bursts into REGGIE's room. As he enters, REGGIE, who was hiding behind the door, slams it shut, locks it, and pockets the key. DYLE, finding himself trapped, checks the door to the hallway, only to discover it's locked as well. REGGIE smiles triumphantly at him. Resigned, DYLE sits and begins to remove his shoes again.\n\nCuriously, DYLE tests the water in the bathroom with his hand before stepping into the bathtub fully clothed. REGGIE watches in disbelief, moving closer to the open bathroom door for a better view. DYLE, now in the tub, takes out his handkerchief, rinses it, and then reads a label inside his coat. Playfully, he flicks water at REGGIE, grabs a nail-brush, and meticulously scrubs his watch and watch-band, holding up his wrist to show her. He starts to unbutton his suit, prompting REGGIE to turn away and leave, slamming the door behind her.\n\nThe phone rings, and REGGIE answers it, her face falling as if the rug has been pulled out from under her. Slowly, she replaces the receiver, a worried look crossing her face. Meanwhile, the bathroom door opens, revealing DYLE wrapped in a large bath towel. REGGIE shakes her head in response to something he says.\n\nThe scene transitions to a large motor launch cruising along the river, brightly lit and festive. At a table set for two near the rail, the cityscape drifts by in the background. REGGIE and DYLE return to their table where a waiter is arranging a spread of food, predominantly on REGGIE's side. She reacts with surprise and looks at DYLE with a mix of happiness and amazement before pushing her plate away.\n\nSuddenly, the lights on the boat go out, and a searchlight near the bridge activates, sweeping across the riverbanks. On benches along the water's edge, lovers caught in the beam react in various ways—some embarrassed, some amused, and others visibly annoyed by the sudden intrusion.",
    "48": "In a quiet moment, he rummages through another drawer, extracting an assortment of sandwiches encased in wax paper, a salt and pepper shaker, a tube of mustard, a bottle of red wine, and two Dixie cups. He uncorks the wine, pours it into a cup, and starts to eat. He then offers a sandwich to her and fills another cup with wine for her consumption. Reaching back into the drawer, he retrieves a glass and passes it to her.\n\nThe scene shifts to a formal setting where four men, clad in military uniforms, are seated behind a table. A glass is positioned over the first photo, enlarging the image of a youthful Charles Lampert. The glass, along with the camera, then moves to highlight the fourth image, that of a young man. Reggie gives a nod of acknowledgment. He quickly scribbles a note on a pad of paper, tears it off, and hands it to her.\n\nSuddenly, the room fills with the loud cheers of children. Reggie and Peter turn their attention toward the stage where Punch and Judy are engaged in a loud dispute, soon escalating into a physical confrontation, striking each other on the head. The climax comes when Judy forcefully knocks Punch out of view, and a puppet, adorned with a three-cornered hat, emerges on stage. Standing somewhat apart, a man wearing a hat observes the scene quietly from the background. The action continues with Judy and a policeman exchanging blows, while Punch's head briefly reappears on the opposite side of the stage, utters a line, and then quickly retreats. Charles was entangled in something sinister.\n\nThe intensity continues as Judy gains the upper hand and mercilessly beats the policeman. Close up, Grandpierre winces at the sight. He is then seen on a dance floor in front of a lively Latin band, illuminated by a spotlight, wearing his professional smile as he addresses the crowd through a microphone. The camera shifts to a table where Reggie, adorned in an elegant Givenchy dress, is seated. In a sudden burst of action, Reggie delivers a forceful kick to Gideon's shin. Gideon, feeling the sharp pain, stiffens but keeps his reaction silent, merely closing his eyes. Around them, Reggie, Gideon, and Peter, along with other onlookers, watch the unfolding scene. Peter quickly steps forward as Reggie notices Gideon's lack of resistance. She steps back, leaving Gideon holding an orange under his chin, his eyes still shut. Reggie gazes at him briefly. Slowly, Gideon's eyes open, and tears begin to flow down his cheeks as he speaks, still clutching the orange. Then, turning to the woman behind him, Gideon signals for the game to continue.\n\nIn another tense moment, she realizes she has neglected to press the button that would connect her call and allow her voice to be heard at the other end. Tex, in a calm manner, retrieves a book of matches from his pocket, strikes one, and lights his cigarette, holding the flame afterward. Without uttering a word, Tex tosses the still-burning match into the booth, landing it on Reggie's lap, prompting her to frantically extinguish it. Tex lights another match and menacingly extends it towards her hair.",
    "53": "In a desperate bid to stop him, the protagonist grips the large man tightly by the raincoat's lapels. Despite the intense strain distorting his face, SCOBIE relentlessly advances toward the gun. Abruptly, DYLE releases his grip, causing SCOBIE to surge forward uncontrollably. He tumbles past the gun, propelled by his momentum onto the roof's sloped section, where he begins a perilous slide. Frantically, SCOBIE claws at the slate roof, attempting to secure a hold, the scratching noise and sparking adding to the tension. As he slides off the edge, he vanishes from sight. Watching this unfold, DYLE stands mesmerized until SCOBIE's metal hand suddenly grips the rain gutter at the roof's very edge. After witnessing this, DYLE walks to the edge of the flat roof section, then descends the stairs and exits via the elevator to his own room, where the manager gives him a cold stare.\n\nREGGIE then leads DYLE into her room and guides him to the bed, where she sits him down. She cleans a wound on his back with disinfectant-soaked cotton, causing him to wince, before bandaging it as they converse. Amidst their conversation, REGGIE begins to kiss DYLE affectionately on the neck, chin, cheek, and finally the mouth. Their intimate moment is interrupted by the ringing phone. As REGGIE continues kissing him, DYLE attempts to speak. The persistent ringing leads REGGIE to eventually lift the receiver from the bedstand, mumbling into it. TEX's voice comes through the phone, prompting REGGIE to cover it and turn to DYLE in alarm.\n\nMeanwhile, TEX lifts JEAN-LOUIS and places him on SCOBIE's other knee just as a knock sounds at the door. GIDEON answers it, allowing REGGIE and DYLE to enter. REGGIE immediately notices JEAN-LOUIS and TEX's gun. A tense pause follows as the three men exchange unhappy glances. GIDEON then takes DYLE's key, handing over his own, and does the same with REGGIE. Amid this, TEX busily searches through the bureau, momentarily pausing before joining GIDEON. They empty the contents of a bag onto a table and begin inspecting them. GIDEON opens a wallet, sets it aside, and then picks up a letter, extracting it from its envelope to read. A broad grin spreads across TEX's face as they continue their examination of the bag's items.",
    "54": "Gittes retrieves a shot glass from his desk and chooses a less costly bottle of bourbon from among several more expensive whiskeys. He pours a generous shot and slides the glass across his desk to Curly. Curly gazes blankly at it before lifting the glass and draining it in one go. As they pass Sophie, who deliberately avoids eye contact, Gittes wraps an arm around Curly and beams a dazzling smile. However, as he closes the door behind Curly, his smile vanishes.\n\nUpon Gittes's entrance, Walsh stands up. Gittes acknowledges him with a nod and continues inside. He approaches Mrs. Mulwray, pulling up a chair between Duffy and Walsh, and offers her a warm, sympathetic smile. She holds her breath. Gittes shoots Duffy an irritated look, prompting Duffy to stop chewing, while Gittes sighs.\n\nFormer Mayor Sam Bagby is addressing the room, with a large map decorated with overleafs and bold lettering behind him. Some councilmen distractedly peruse comic strips and gossip columns during his speech. Nearby, a few disheveled farmers sit, visibly bored; one of them yawns and shifts away from a particularly dirty farmer. The audience, composed of farmers, businessmen, and city workers, listens intently. One man looks up from his racing form with interest. Amid whispered discussions, someone walks up to the detailed map and turns the overleaf. The slender, bespectacled Bagby, in his sixties yet moving with surprising ease, nods to a younger, smaller man who makes the adjustment. Mulwray then leaves the overleaf board and takes a seat.\n\nSuddenly, uproar erupts from the back as a red-faced farmer herds several skinny, bleating sheep into the chamber. Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms, responding to the council's outcry, struggle to corral the sheep and restrain one agitated farmer who seems poised to attack Mulwray physically.\n\nOutside, the sun harshly illuminates the concrete banks of the river, while the earthen banks are dry and overrun with weeds. Mulwray's car soon appears on a flood control road roughly fifteen feet above the riverbed. Gittes, concealed by dried mustard weeds, watches Mulwray through binoculars from a position downstream and just above the road. Mulwray descends to the center of the riverbed, where he stops, turns slowly, and seems to focus either on the riverbed's bottom or perhaps nothing specific.\n\nThen, a small Mexican boy on a swayback horse enters the riverbed, coming into Gittes's view. As Mulwray navigates a bend in the river, he encounters the boy on the muddy banks, prompting Gittes to retreat slightly for a better view.",
    "59": "In the unfolding narrative, Mulwray engages with a boy, pointing to the ground. The boy responds with a gesture. Mulwray then kneels in the mud, his gaze fixed intensely on it as he concentrates deeply. After a brief moment, he rises, expresses gratitude to the boy, and swiftly makes his way upstream, scrambling up the bank to reach his car. Upon arrival at his vehicle, he reaches through the window to retrieve what appears to be a roll of blueprints. He lays them out on the car's hood and starts scribbling notes, occasionally glancing downstream. Soon after, he drives away, eventually stopping and parking his car.\n\nGittes, in a different scene, observes the bay's long, clear crescent to his right. After a moment's hesitation, he moves toward it, choosing to climb the promontory to position himself above Mulwray. From his elevated viewpoint, Mulwray looks up at Gittes with a distracted glance. On the promontory, Mulwray picks up a starfish and watches the water trickling down from an outfall near Gittes. Standing, Mulwray becomes fixated on the water, his fascination palpable. As Gittes observes Mulwray's absorbed attention, the flow of water suddenly increases, gushing in spurts that cascade into the sea, frothing the water.\n\nMulwray finds himself standing in a puddle, his trousers wet from the seat down. A slip of paper is discovered under his windshield wiper, which Gittes removes before entering the car and turning on the dash light. Gittes then opens his glove compartment, revealing a small mountain of Ingersoll pocket watches, still tagged with their cheap prices. He selects one, winds it absentmindedly, checks the time against his own watch, noting it's 9:37, and places it behind the front wheel of Mulwray's car.\n\nWalsh presents Gittes with photographs, which he examines. The series of photos, taken outside a restaurant, show Mulwray with another man whose appearance is notably striking. In two of the images, a gnarled cane is visible. Disgusted, Gittes tosses the photos aside.\n\nIn another scene, Duffy rows a boat with Gittes seated in the stern. They pass by Mulwray and a slender blonde girl in a summer print dress, who are drifting in their own rowboat, with Mulwray affectionately doting on her. Gittes expertly maneuvers past Duffy, snapping a few quick photos. Mulwray and the girl remain blissfully unaware of Gittes and Duffy's presence. Gittes turns their boat again to row past Mulwray and the girl, capturing more photographs swiftly.\n\nThe scene shifts to Gittes perched on a red-tiled roof, his feet hooked over the apex and his body stretched face-down on the tiles. He points himself and his camera at a veranda below, where Mulwray and the girl are dining, capturing the moment.",
    "60": "As Gittes continues snapping photos, the tiles beneath his feet suddenly come loose, initiating his slow slide down the roof towards a perilous three-story drop. Simultaneously, the dislodged tile also begins to move, and a fragment from its cracked edge falls away. In an attempt to mitigate his descent, Gittes tries to slow himself down. Below, Mulwray notices the fallen fragment at his feet, prompting him to stand and gaze upwards at the roof before turning his attention to a nearby girl.\n\nBack at his office, Gittes reviews the heart-shaped drawing surrounding one of his photographs, reminiscent of Hearst's yellow press style, which brings a self-satisfied smile to his face. Meanwhile, a car stalls on the street, its hood raised as a man observes his radiator boiling over. Inside a barbershop, Gittes, amidst reading a newspaper and getting a haircut and his shoes shined, notices almost all the customers engaged in similar activities. Suddenly, he straightens up and exits the chair, prompting a concerned Barney to attempt to hold him back by the barber sheet around his neck. A customer nearby shrinks back into his seat as Gittes bursts in, energetically slapping a newspaper against his thigh.\n\nShortly after, Gittes returns to his office, only for a stunning young woman, appearing to be in her late twenties, to appear behind him, accompanied soon after by a small, gray-haired man. They listen to the unfolding scene, unseen by Gittes, who first laughs and then is staggered by the presence of the young woman, nearly gasping at her beauty. The gray-haired man winces as she walks past him towards the door, where Evelyn begins to leave, prompting Gittes to follow. He manages to stop her, met with a cold smile from Evelyn before she exits. This time, Gittes is halted by the gray-haired man who has come out of his office and approached from behind.\n\nIn a moment of pause, Gittes stares at the papers in his hand before turning to receive a thick sheaf of legal documents—a summons and complaint. Despite a protest from the secretary who half-rises, Gittes proceeds through the inner door into an office adorned with commendations, photos of Mulwray at various construction sites, and large maps depicting the city’s watershed areas and reservoirs. On the desk, a framed, tinted photo of Evelyn in riding clothes catches his eye. As Gittes moves towards the desk, he keeps an eye on the translucent pane in the upper half of the door leading to the outer office. He begins to search the desk, quickly examining the top before opening and closing the drawers. Reopening the top drawer causes the bottom one to open; inside, he finds a checkbook, which he opens and quickly flips through the stubs as if shuffling cards.",
    "61": "Gittes, in the midst of searching, accidentally drops an item and discovers a collection of keys, an aged phone book, and a menu from a 1913 Water Department lunch at the Biltmore Hotel. As he continues, he notices a shadow ominously looming against a translucent pane. He proceeds to enter the room, with an anxious Secretary trailing closely behind him.\n\nGittes exchanges a nod with Yelburton, and they exit through the outer office, making their way down the hall to Yelburton's office. This space, smaller than Mulwray's, features a lacquered marlin prominently mounted on the wall. The room is also adorned with various photographs of Yelburton proudly posing with yellowtail and other catches. A small burgee featuring a fish and the initials \"A.C.\" is tacked onto the wall as well. Gittes' attention shifts to a card tray on Yelburton's desk; he casually lifts a couple of cards from it, slipping them into his handkerchief pocket.\n\nUpon leaving, Gittes nearly collides with Mulvihill, a man of similar age but significantly larger, standing rigidly by the Secretary's desk in a poorly fitting plain suit. Mulvihill's intense, unblinking gaze locks onto Gittes, and as he advances, trembling with rage, Yelburton quickly steps between them and rings a bell.\n\nA commanding Chinese Butler, distinguished by heavy hair and a gold half-jacket on one front tooth, responds to the bell and appears at the door. Gittes hands him a card from his wallet, and the Butler, after receiving it, retreats, leaving Gittes to stand awkwardly in the doorway.\n\nAs Gittes waits, he begins to sweat, observing a Japanese Gardener meticulously trimming a hedge nearby. Not far off, a chauffeur diligently cleans a cream-colored Packard with a chamois, from which steam visibly rises and a squeaking sound emanates. Gittes turns and sees the Chinese Butler gesturing for him to follow.\n\nFollowing the Butler, Gittes tries to peek into the rooms as they pass, noticing a maid tidying up in the den. They continue through the den, exiting via French doors to a trellised walkway that leads to a large pond with running water. The Gardener soon rushes back, greets Gittes with a smile, and begins probing the pond. After a brief moment, he drops his long probe, causing the waters to recede and revealing that the pond is overflowing.\n\nThe atmosphere suddenly becomes very quiet, save for the sound of the running water, leaving Gittes standing beside the pond. His eyes catch something gleaming at the bottom of the pond. The Gardener, nodding, quickly departs, leaving Gittes fixated on the gleaming object.\n\nTaking note of the situation, Gittes hesitates but then picks up the tool the Gardener had used and starts probing the pond himself, aiming for the gleaming object. As he does this, he notices Evelyn approaching from around a turn, walking down the trellised pathway. In an attempt to appear nonchalant, Gittes casually belts the probe, maintaining his grip on it for poise.",
    "62": "Evelyn, dressed in white-lathered jeans with brown horsehair lacing on the inner thighs and riding boots, appears slightly perspired yet younger than her office demeanor. Gittes, caught off guard by her presence, joins her at a glass-topped table where Ramon serves them iced tea on a tray. Evelyn glances up, prompting a sheepish smile from Gittes, who laughs nervously and nods in response.\n\nDriving up a winding road, Gittes follows a flood channel into the parched hills. At the reservoir entrance, a rescue truck and milling crowd are present; the chain link fence, marked with a KEEP OUT sign, stands open. Below lies the reservoir. Uniformed police halt Gittes' car, to whom he presents a card from Yelburton, retrieved from his handkerchief pocket. Allowed past the guards, Gittes proceeds through the gate and along the reservoir before stopping and exiting his vehicle.\n\nGittes notices both a police car and an unmarked one. Several men, one conversing quietly, have their backs to him, their focus on the reservoir where others in small skiffs are dredging. One man, recognizing Gittes, reacts with visible shock. As Loach attempts to guide Gittes away, a man speaking with two boys in swimming trunks at the channel's edge turns at the sound of a raised voice. Both Gittes and Escobar display considerable surprise upon seeing each other, creating unease among the surrounding men. They take a few steps together, with Gittes pulling out his cigarette case, to which Escobar nods and eventually smiles, under the watchful eyes of two plainclothesmen and a uniformed officer.\n\nEscobar points to the reservoir, where men using poles with hooks are searching the water. They successfully hook something, and, upon pulling, reveal the soaking back of a man's coat. As they drag the body into the skiff, it becomes evident that it is Mulwray's body. Escobar draws back the sheet covering the body and then drops it again. Evelyn, nodding, joins Escobar as they move a few feet aside to whisper, almost as if avoiding the corpse's hearing. They slowly proceed toward the door, with Evelyn looking at Escobar, unsure of how to respond to his queries. Escobar nods once more. Throughout this, Gittes sits on a wooden bench, smoking and listening to the unfolding events.",
    "63": "At the sound of the question, he stands and peers through the doorway. Escobar spots him but chooses to ignore his presence. Evelyn, upon lifting her gaze, finds Gittes mere feet away, standing in the doorway. She freezes in her tracks. Directly behind her stands Escobar. For a prolonged moment, their eyes lock in a silent exchange. Gittes remains silent throughout. Evelyn resumes her task, her eyes eventually meeting Gittes's with a look of pleading. A slight nod from Evelyn is punctuated by Escobar's cough. Gittes then grasps the sheet and pulls it away, revealing a face that is severely cut and bruised, with open eyes staring blankly. As they start to move away at a leisurely pace, they must sidestep as another body is wheeled out from a coroner's cubicle. Morty, assisted by another, brings in a new body. He removes the sheet and brushes sand off the man's face, chuckling. As he attempts to store the body in the refrigerator, he's overtaken by a severe coughing fit. Morty simply shrugs. The Boy, when addressed, does not reply but later nods in acknowledgment. Nearby, a horse snorts as The Boy continues his slow journey.\n\nGittes, climbing the embankment near Hollenbeck Bridge, observes the direction of the storm drain, which points toward the Hollywood Hills where the sun is setting. He proceeds along the flood channel, which now lies in darkness. Using his car's spotlight, Gittes navigates a dirt road surrounded by dense clusters of oak and eucalyptus trees. After a turn, a panoramic view of a lake of lights in the city below appears over the road. He takes a fork in the road that allows him to keep tracking the flood channel, which becomes narrower, prompting him to drive more cautiously. A chain-link fence stretches over and into the channel, blocking access. Gittes reverses, switches off the car's motor, lights, and spotlight. The only light comes from a single bulb hanging on overhead tension wires. He exits the vehicle and forcefully strikes the fence near the flood channel. Lights from a higher reservoir are visible. Carefully, Gittes navigates through thick foliage toward a larger second chain-link fence. He then plunges into the flood control channel, about four feet deep and six feet wide, and conceals himself among the ivy. Attempting to ascertain his direction, he raises his head but is suddenly overwhelmed by a surge of water. The torrent sweeps him down the channel, stripping his hat away and causing him to collide with the banks as he struggles to cling to the overgrowth for escape. The relentless current propels him until he is abruptly halted by another chain-link fence.",
    "67": "In the quiet morning, a dog yawns and shakes its head before standing up and wagging its tail enthusiastically. Meanwhile, a phone receiver is forcefully returned to its cradle. In a dimly lit room, a rumpled figure slowly rises from the bed, sits motionless for a moment, musses his hair, and then stands. Identified as Dante, he briefly wrestles with the dog before it laps water from the toilet. Dante, wrapped in a towel, opens the refrigerator, peers inside, and grabs a half-empty gallon of milk, closing the door afterward. He proceeds to measure out four scoops of chocolate milk mix into a tumbler and gulps down his breakfast.\n\nDante then reaches for keys atop a VCR, and shortly after, a car pulls up with a screech. Feet step out onto the ground from the open car door. Keys are forcefully inserted into a lock, popping it open. Dante lifts a metal shutter, revealing the entrance to a convenience store. As the lights are switched on, the store's well-stocked interior is gloriously illuminated. Dante passes by a cat that glances at him as he moves past the camera. A paper bundle is expertly snapped open with scissors, and Dante grabs two bundles of papers, flinging them into the store. He fills the newspaper racks, leaving one conspicuously empty.\n\nIn the store, a coffee filter is carefully placed into a metal pot, followed by ground coffee, and the assembly is pushed into the coffeemaker. The switch is flicked, bringing the machine to life. The empty rack labeled ASBURY PARK PRESS stands out among the others, causing Dante to look puzzled and annoyed. Realization dawns on him as he rolls his eyes.\n\nDante steps back to retrieve a coin, opens the cash register to extract a quarter, and through the murky glass and thin metal grating, we watch him approach the Asbury Park Press vending machine. He pauses to drop the quarter into the slot, pulls the door down, and reaches inside to grab a stack of newspapers. Struggling to hold them in one hand, he lets the door slam shut. The sound of the quarter dropping into the change slot halts him momentarily, but he resumes walking away as the newspapers are placed into the previously empty rack with a flop, and the quarter returns to the register drawer.\n\nOutside again, Dante attempts to insert a key into the window shutter lock, but finds it obstructed by gum or a similar substance. Frustrated, he examines the lock, looks around, and kicks the shutter in anger.",
    "71": "As the movie unfolds, a smoker enters the scene, immediately drawing the attention of Dante, who pauses his examination of an oddity labeled O.C. to search for cigarettes. The smoker's gaze shifts from Randal to the O.C. oddity, then back to Randal. Meanwhile, an odd man delicately covers an egg on the floor with a handkerchief, only to swiftly remove it, revealing the egg still intact on the floor. This peculiar action captures the attention of Dante, Randal, and the smoker, who all stare at the O.C. man. The scene shifts as a young girl, no older than five, enters with a smile, clutching money in her hand.\n\nThe atmosphere changes when a female customer briskly places items on the counter and stands silently, waiting to be served. Dante rings her up, but the moment is disrupted when Randal flamboyantly opens a magazine to a provocative centerfold, causing the customer to quickly leave as Dante offers frantic apologies. Randal then wistfully examines the centerfold.\n\nThe focus shifts to a woman who meticulously searches through a cooler for the perfect gallon of milk. The narrative then transitions to a series of people addressing the camera with absurd questions, followed by more individuals posing equally foolish inquiries from various spots in the convenience store.\n\nTension builds as Dante shoves Randal to silence him. The entrance of Veronica, carrying books and a foil-covered dish, is met with Dante's immediate attention as he takes the books from her. Randal, in a disruptive mood, makes loud slurping noises off-camera and pats Veronica on the head as he walks past, eventually exiting the store, followed by Veronica.\n\nRandal then engages with potential customers, recommending titles, but his disruptive nature persists as he re-enters the store with another loud slurping sound before hanging up his phone. Dante, frustrated, shakes his head and picks up the phone again, rolling his eyes in exasperation. Randal returns, adding to the ongoing commotion.\n\nThe scene shifts to preparations for a hockey game: tape is wrapped around the top of a stick, an orange ball is hit back and forth with a blade, and laces are pulled tight. Randal enters, fully equipped for the game, as hockey players flood into the convenience store. Sanford makes a dramatic entrance, skating in and skidding to a halt.\n\nOn the roof, the players, including Dante, skate and pass the ball. They climb up a ladder adjacent to the door, one after the other. From across the street, the bizarre sight of men skating around on the roof of the store is fully appreciated. Some players sit on the floor or lean against coolers, all preparing or practicing for the game. On the roof, Randal, donning his mask and slapping his glove, encourages a shot. Sanford skates in and takes a shot, which Randal blocks.\n\nThe movie concludes with an unconventional transaction as Jay and Silent Bob deal to one of the players; the player drops money over the ledge, and Jay tosses up a dime bag in return.",
    "72": "Dante, gripping a ball, stands assertively at the center of the court. Meanwhile, Redding stretches leisurely, leaning against a nearby sign. Dante then skids rapidly to the sidelines, followed by a smooth skate to his side. He skids back to address a customer waiting there.\n\nBelow this scene, a woman struggles with a door, her face pressed against the glass as she peers into the store. She steps back, shielding her eyes to gaze towards the roof.\n\nBack on the court, a new face-off ensues as Dante confronts the customer. The customer, winding up, unleashes a hard shot. The ball soars off the court, through the air, and lands in a distant yard. Amidst this, the ball drops between Dante and another player, leading to Dante being forcefully flattened. Panicked, Dante scrambles to the court's edge and calls out in distress. Hyperventilating, he looks around frantically and calls to the sidelines once more. Sanford skates up to him in response, and soon after, Dante skates away.\n\nLater, Dante is seen atop a ladder, diligently replacing a fluorescent light. An old man joins him at the ladder's base, watching as Dante finishes the task, descends the ladder, and closes it. Dante glances over, visibly reacting to something, as the old man walks away. Dante heads back to the counter but is visibly taken aback when the old man returns.\n\nIn another scene, Dante and Randal are in a car, their backs to the camera, enveloped in absolute silence. Dante glares at Randal tensely. Outside the car, a massive crowd gathers in front of a store. Dante and Randal then walk solemnly up a path to a funeral parlor. Suddenly, car locks are slammed down as they run from the front door, pursued by a small, angry crowd of mourners. Their car speeds away, leaving the pursuing crowd in the middle of the street, shaking their fists and throwing objects.\n\nUpon arriving at another location, Dante and Randal exit the car to find absolutely nobody outside. Jay then enters the frame beside Randal, cheekily aiming his butt at him and letting out a fart. Dante, reacting quickly, grabs Randal as Randal lunges for Jay. A kid tugs at Jay's shirt during this scuffle. Eventually, Dante and Randal head back to the counter.\n\nShaking his head, Dante walks away. At the counter, he puts up cigarettes, while a customer absorbs the situation before storming out in a huff. Another customer leans in, and Randal, in a mischievous act, spits a mist of water at him, soaking the man. The drenched customer reacts violently, attempting to grab Randal over the counter, but Dante intervenes, blocking him. Randal, though targeted, remains untouched and casually salutes his attacker before the soaked customer leaves, wiping his face. Randal then exits.\n\nDante, now serving another customer named Trainer, lifts a gallon of milk into a paper bag with a slight grunt. A female customer, Heather, leans casually in the doorway. A suited man carrying a notebook approaches the counter and scribbles in it before tearing out a piece of paper and handing it to Dante. As the suited man exits, Dante attempts to follow him.",
    "76": "John adjusts his oar, steering the skiff through moonlit, turbulent water. They navigate toward the shore, eventually reaching the top of the bank. In the background, a corner of a barn is visible with a lighted window. Near the window, a wire bird-cage hangs close to the shade, its silhouette distinct. Inside the cage, a canary perches quietly.\n\nAfter a brief pause, children enter the scene, their backs to the viewer, and stop to gaze at the sight before them. The light from the window illuminates their faces as the canary's song fades. The man vanishes into the distance beyond some trees, his singing becoming fainter. He then awakens someone, and as he disappears again, sounds of children scurrying in hay can be heard off-screen, alongside the quieting of dogs and the fading of his song.\n\nHand in hand, John and the children rush out of the barn, moving along its side towards the river, which is out of sight. The skiff, with the children asleep inside, glides across calm water, passing fully beneath the viewer before the water turns blank again, accompanied by the distant barking of a fox. The skiff approaches a sandbar, and its prow gently scrapes against the sand.\n\nThe camera tilts upward as roosters crow in the distance, moving from a distant view to a closer one. John turns his gaze towards Pearl, who is busy picking daisies. Beyond a nearby fence, Rachel Cooper emerges, carrying a berry basket on her arm.\n\nSuddenly, John scrambles to his feet, grabs an oar, and holds it defensively. Pearl freezes, and both hesitate before Rachel, breaking off a switch and advancing through the mud towards them. She herds them like geese up the bank and across a meadow, their movement resembling a scene from a nursery frieze. As she nears Pearl's calves with her switch, John turns in response.\n\nIn another part of the scene, three figures crouch to pick tomatoes beyond a low white fence, with Rachel's house visible in the background. Ruby, thirteen, Clary, eleven, and Mary, four, each pop up like targets on a rifle range. Rachel firmly grips John and Pearl by their napes, inspecting baskets of tomatoes carried by the three girls as they enter, their backs to the viewer.\n\nRachel opens the gate, ushering the Harper children through before shutting it and walking between them, her back still to the viewer. The children hesitate once more, prompting Rachel to turn, stop, and look them over critically. If her face were visible, her lips would be seen pursed and moving with anger.\n\nJohn's eyes lower to Rachel's feet, initiating a slow upward examination of her figure, revealing her as the story's heroine. From John's perspective, the camera slowly tilts up, taking in her mud-heavy man's shoes, rough skirt, shapeless sweater, and an old man's hat on her head. She is in her mid-sixties, and her face expresses a profound sense of familiarity to John, who suddenly feels as if he has come home.\n\nRachel begins to scrub John mercilessly, a task he clearly dislikes, while Ruby gently washes Pearl with a cloth. John, hating the scrubbing, breaks away and dodges behind a bush, with Rachel in hot pursuit.",
    "77": "Rachel's head emerges above a bush, and the sound of a female hand lightly spanking a child can be heard. Everyone in the group is carrying a basket as Rachel leads the procession forward. A cattle dealer casually walks in the opposite direction, and Rachel continues her march. The group walks on in silence.\n\nA waitress rushes away from the scene, deftly dodging a passing car. Rachel's gaze follows the waitress and then shifts to a pair of lovers in a car, absorbing their presence. Frustrated with herself and other women, Rachel sighs and turns away.\n\nThe scene shifts to the entrance of a grocery store where the grocer stands on his doorstep. Rachel enters the store with him, and they approach the counter together. Amidst wolf whistles heard off-screen, Rachel stands with her market basket, her eyes searching the world around her.\n\nRuby signals Rachel's proximity with a gesture, and with a nod, he turns and walks away. Ruby, keeping an eye on the first loafer, follows him. In the background, John enters the scene. Pearl clutches a doll close to her as John quietly moves to her side. They stand together, a familiar sight.\n\nAs John turns, Rachel continues her routine, setting aside a book and picking up her mending. She works on it for a few moments. John moves behind her, heading towards the door. He approaches with two apples in hand and gently offers one to Rachel. In a tender moment, John reaches out and places his fingers softly on Rachel's knuckles.\n\nRachel, feeling grateful but restrained, speaks gruffly, unable to express her thanks openly. Though John doesn't notice, the gratitude in Rachel's eyes is evident.\n\nRachel walks down a neon-lit street, drugstores and loafers visible in the background, with jazz music filling the air. Two loafers lounge on a bench as Ruby approaches. He rises and moves towards Ruby, who catches his eye. Ruby turns to a magazine stand, casually flipping through lurid and tawdry fan and pin-up magazines as she waits for the loafer to approach in the background.\n\nA preacher steps between Ruby and the loafer, turning to face Ruby in a close shot. The loafer pauses behind them. Ruby looks up at the preacher with admiration before glancing at the loafers and then back to the preacher. Ruby is finishing her soda, a familiar signal to the preacher. She nods in acknowledgment.\n\nThe preacher slides something into his knife pocket. Ruby watches him go, clutching a magazine under her chin as her hero strides away into the darkness, her gaze lingering after him.\n\nOvercome with emotion, Ruby collapses face down on Rachel's lap, sobbing. They weep together. Rachel begins styling Ruby's hair, transforming it to that of a young woman. Ruby responds with a nod and a shrug.\n\nStartled by the sight of the preacher, Ruby drops two eggs. The preacher tethers his horse and walks to the bottom of the steps, with Ruby appearing at the side of the shot. Beyond the preacher, Rachel is seen standing behind her screen door, her hands folded under her apron.",
    "78": "From Rachel's perspective through the screen, the Preacher's face twitches with emotion before he breaks into profound sobs of gratitude. Ruby delicately makes her way around the side of the house, and the Preacher, wiping tears away with his left hand, watches her intently. He then raises his right hand as all the children enter from around the corner of the house. As they approach, Rachel responds, standing now on the top step with John, who grips her skirt as if to draw her close, his gaze locked with hers. All the children, including Pearl who lies just beyond John, freeze in place.\n\nJohn, still fixated on Rachel, looks deep into her eyes, seeking clarity. The realization hits Rachel that John has sold her. Turning her attention to the Preacher off-screen, she watches as he rises to his feet, an open knife in his hand, which he lightly bounces as he backs towards his horse. His gun-barrel twitches as he mounts the horse. Rachel sits in profile on a big bed, her gun across her knees, while Ruby, sitting up in bed, listens to a song from outside. The camera pans to show the Preacher, hunched on a stump outside, seen through the window. After a moment, Ruby, perhaps seeking comfort or trying to drown out the Preacher's voice, joins in the hymn being sung by Rachel and the Preacher off-screen.\n\nA candle moves past a window as Rachel and the Preacher's voices sing, then the song ends. Ruby enters, carrying a candle, whose light momentarily darkens the window-glass. Rachel, looking up, blows out the candle and, as she approaches the window, notices that the Preacher has gone. She stands, then walks back to her chair, the children's eyes following her with complete trust. Her eyes glitter as she turns to face the camera. The clock begins to strike three, and Rachel turns towards an off-screen sound. In the mirror, a shadow ducks, prompting Rachel to rise with her gun at the ready, facing into the darkness. Bending low, she instructs the children who scatter out of view, except for Ruby, who remains in a trance.\n\nRachel continues to watch into the darkness as the Preacher's satanic face and his hand lifting the open knife suddenly rise from the floor. She fires her gun, hitting the Preacher who staggers out and runs into the barn, yelping in pain. The children huddle on the stairs in a respectful silence. Rachel, with her gun sportily slung under one arm, speaks into a wall phone within the box stairway. Later, she sits awake on the screened porch, her gun on her knees, while John sleeps on the floor, his head resting against her.",
    "83": "Reluctantly, they begin their journey. Willa heads towards the river, while Icey moves towards a group. We follow Icey as she walks, and a preacher approaches her. Icey playfully shoves him towards Willa with a coy smile. Icey then joins other women who are busy making fudge.\n\nJohn and Pearl approach the scene. From John's perspective, he sees Willa and the preacher engaged in a formal courtship, surrounded by hefty figures, creating a decorous tableau. John and Pearl sit by the water under drooping willows, the setting almost mocking a romantic scene. John tilts his head and smiles strangely as he watches his mother intently, with Pearl holding his hand. In the background, Walt looks sheepish as everyone's attention turns towards Willa, who stands and gestures for John to come to her. John and Pearl, along with a doll, shyly approach her. Willa appears radiant.\n\nJohn struggles to hide his feelings, believing Ben has betrayed him, and quickly masks his new emotions. Willa warmly touches the preacher's hand before walking over to Icey and the other women. John positions himself in front of the preacher, and Pearl stands beside him with the doll. From John's eye level, the preacher is seen busy with his hands off-screen, Pearl with her doll, and Willa in the background. Suddenly, Willa runs quickly towards Icey, who approaches with open arms. Behind them, the group of women watches, and nearby, Birdie sits by his open door, strumming a guitar and singing under the soft glow of lamplight.\n\nIn the foreground, Ben's skiff rests upside down on trestles. At the beginning of the scene, only John's feet are visible as he examines the skiff from underneath. After singing a few lines, John emerges, leaning against the skiff and tracing a tarry seam with his finger. Throughout the scene, Birdie continues to play his guitar lazily. John then exits the frame.\n\nAs John runs past Spoon's, his curiosity draws him to look inside. Meanwhile, Icey either embraces or waltzes Willa around, with Walt watching approvingly. John hurries towards home. In the otherwise dark house, one window glows with light. John enters the frame with his back to us, hesitates upon seeing the illuminated window, and listens silently. After a pause, he cautiously walks towards us.\n\nThe scene shifts to a tall, narrow shooting frame with the right and left thirds of the screen obscured. We view from inside a screen door as John crosses the porch, gently opens the door, and tiptoes inside, pausing close to us in the dark hallway. He listens intently, feeling a mix of relief and confusion, before tiptoeing further down the hallway as the camera pulls away.",
    "88": "Jerry Lundegaard, clad in a parka and a red plaid Elmer Fudd hat, enters through the kitchen door. He's carrying a bag of groceries, which he promptly places on the kitchen counter, pulling off his plaid cap as he does so. Meanwhile, Wade Gustafson, a vigorous man in his mid-sixties with a full head of gray hair, is introduced.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to an aerial view of a two-lane highway flanked by snowfields. A single car moves along this road, driven by Carl Showalter with Gaear Grimsrud beside him, giving Carl a sour look after a long pause, his blank stare lingering.\n\nBack in the dealership, Jerry sits in his glassed-in salesman's cubicle adjacent to the showroom floor. Across from him, an irate customer and his wife express their frustrations. Jerry, feeling the weight of the moment, rises from his seat and moves to a nearby cubicle, leaving the couple to watch him go. He sits back down, staring at his lap, lost in thought.\n\nElsewhere, Carl and Gaear find themselves in a motel room, sharing twin beds with two truck-stop hookers. The scene shifts again as a woman picks up a phone, holds it away from her to call out, and then hands it over to another person who takes the call.\n\nJerry wanders through the dealership's service area, where mechanics are at work on various cars. He pauses near an Indian mechanic in blue jeans, who is examining the underside of a car elevated on a hydraulic lift, a cage light illuminating the car's innards.\n\nBack on the road, Carl drives while Gaear stares out the front window, later seen smoking and gazing out into the distance. Carl continues to drive while simultaneously handling a phone call.\n\nOn a morning show, a host dressed in an apron stands behind a kitchen set counter. In another setting, Jean sets down her coffee cup and rises just as two men, Carl and Gaear, enter a room, the door slamming shut behind them. Jean, now sobbing, frantically attempts to call for help on a princess phone, but it slips from her grasp, jangling across the tile floor, smashing against the door, and bouncing away with its cord ripped free. Desperate, Jean crosses to a high window above the toilet, opens it, and climbs onto the toilet seat and then the tank, glancing back nervously.\n\nThe sound of a door being forced open breaks the tense silence; the wood around the knob splinters and the knob falls to the floor. The door creaks as it swings fully open, allowing Carl and Gaear to enter the room. They find it empty except for the open window. Carl immediately strides to the window, hoists himself out, and begins the pursuit. Inside, Gaear, meanwhile, opens the medicine cabinet, delicately tapping aside various bottles and tubes in search of the right unguent. He finds a salve but sets it down upon noticing something in the mirror.\n\nThe tension culminates as Gaear reaches for the shower curtain, which suddenly explodes outward, driven by thrashing limbs. Jean, screaming and tangled in the curtain, tears it off its rings and stumbles out into the bedroom, her escape attempt now in full swing.",
    "89": "In a frantic escape, Jean, shrouded by a shower curtain, rushes toward the door but struggles to free herself from the obstructing fabric. Her struggle continues as she crashes into the upstairs railing, stumbles over the curtain, and tumbles down the stairs with a series of jarring thumps. Grimsrud, unfazed, follows her descent and trots down after her.\n\nMeanwhile, in a tense office meeting, Wade sits sternly behind his desk as another man, Stan Grossman, rises to greet Jerry upon his entrance. Stan shakes Jerry's hand, while Wade's scowl deepens as he watches the interaction, clearly displeased.\n\nThe scene shifts to the parking lot of the office building, viewed from above. Jerry emerges, bundled tightly in a parka, his arms awkwardly protruding from the sides as his breath turns to vapor in the cold air. He proceeds to his car, opens the front door, retrieves a red plastic scraper, and begins to meticulously remove a thin layer of ice from his windshield. The scraping sound echoes crisply in the chilly atmosphere. Suddenly, Jerry erupts into a frenzy, vigorously banging the scraper against the windshield and the car's hood. Once his outburst subsides, he resumes his task, the scraping resuming its steady rhythm.\n\nBack at his home, Jerry enters cautiously with a grocery sack in hand, closing the door behind him. He immediately notices the shower curtain lying on the floor. Standing still, hands on hips, he gazes down at a telephone. After a moment of hesitation, he picks it up and dials a number.\n\nThe focus shifts to a rural scene where a flannel-shirted woodsman, carrying a double-edged axe over his shoulder, stands on a pedestal. The distant rumble of an approaching car is heard as the camera pans down his body to the pedestal itself. A sweep of headlights briefly illuminates a sign on the pedestal before the car passes by and fades into the background, leaving the two-lane highway empty.\n\nInside the moving vehicle, Carl drives while Jean, bound and curled beneath a tarpaulin, lies whimpering in the back seat. Grimsrud, seated beside Carl, smokes casually and gazes out the window. He turns to look at something, then shifts his gaze back to the window. A sudden loud WHOOP startles Carl, prompting him to glance back through the rear window. A state trooper, fifty yards behind, has activated his lights. Carl checks the rear-view mirror, and Grimsrud watches him closely. Both vehicles come to a stop on the gravel shoulder. Carl looks into the back seat as the car slows and bounces. The trooper, positioned just behind them, begins writing in his citation book while Carl observes. Grimsrud maintains his calm demeanor, smoking and staring out the window as the trooper approaches, his hand resting lightly on his holster, breath steaming in the cold night air. Carl rolls down his window as the trooper reaches them and begins to scan the car's interior, taking his time.",
    "90": "As he reaches for his wallet, he forces a laugh. The policeman thoughtfully tucks the fifty into the billfold before handing it back into the car. Carl's nervous smile fades away as a whimpering sound emerges. The policeman, hesitating, leans forward into the car to listen more closely. Suddenly, Grimsrud reaches over Carl, grabs the trooper by the hair, and forcefully slams his head down onto the car door. With his free hand, Grimsrud opens the glove compartment, retrieves a gun, stretches over Carl, and shoots the trooper in the back of the head. Jean lets out a piercing scream as Grimsrud releases the policeman, whose head slides out the window, his body collapsing onto the street.\n\nCarl, observing the fallen cop in the road, exits the vehicle and attempts to lift the body. However, headlights emerge, signaling an approaching car. Grimsrud notices the oncoming vehicle, which slows down as it nears. Caught in the headlights, Carl stands frozen with the trooper's body halfway hoisted. The silhouettes of two occupants are barely discernible in the approaching car. Grimsrud quickly slides into the driver's seat, accelerates, and roars past and away. He executes a screeching U-turn, the driver's door slamming shut amidst his swift maneuver. Grimsrud removes a cigarette from his mouth and stubs it out in the ashtray. Up ahead, small red tail lights fishtail.\n\nFrom the back seat, Jean begins to scream as the red tail lights ahead start to turn. A distant crunching sound accompanies their disappearance, leaving the headlights to illuminate only an empty road as the car begins to turn. Grimsrud, not gaining on the tail lights, frowns and slows down. The wrecked car's headlights shine off into a snowfield beside the highway. Grimsrud applies the brakes, causing Jean to slide off the back seat and thump into the leg well. His headlights reveal the car ahead, off the road and crumpled around a telephone pole, having failed to negotiate a turn.\n\nGrimsrud grabs his gun from the front seat, opens his door, and steps out. A young man in a down parka limps across the snowfield, away from the wrecked car. Grimsrud, striding calmly after the injured boy, raises his gun and fires. A poof of feathers marks a hole opening in the boy's back, and he falls forward into the snow. Approaching the wreck, Grimsrud peers inside its half-open door, where a young woman is trapped in the twisted wreckage, injured. Grimsrud raises his gun and fires again.\n\nIn a stark contrast, a blue-winged teal flies over a swampy marshland. The room in which this image hangs is shrouded in darkness. A continuing track through the room reveals a couple sleeping in bed. The man, in his forties and wearing pajamas, is large and big-bellied, his mouth agape as he snores loudly. His arms are draped over a woman in her thirties, clad in a nightie, her mouth also open but silent in sleep.",
    "93": "Jerry, an Asian-American with a broad, friendly demeanor, is seated at a booth in a bustling restaurant. A waitress approaches their table, and he smoothly slides out of his seat to sit next to Marge. Marge clinks her glass in a toast. As they glance around, the scene captures a distant stage where Jose Feliciano, appearing diminutive under the spotlight, performs on a stool, though the acoustics are notably poor. Carl, another patron, grimaces at the sound.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts as Carl is later seen engaging intimately with an escort. Suddenly, the escort is forcefully thrown from the bed. Shep intervenes violently, delivering a hard slap to Carl's face both forehand and backhand. He pulls Carl up, hits him repeatedly, and then yanks Carl's belt from his pants, using it to strangle him. Carl gurgles in distress as Shep continues the assault, kneeing him repeatedly before discarding him onto the floor and whipping him with the belt's buckle end. Carl's face is left deeply bruised and cut.\n\nThe scene transitions to Jerry at a kitchen phone, with Wade in the dining room picking up an extension. Their conversation is cut short as the line goes dead, followed by the sound of a door slamming off-screen. Wade, carrying a briefcase, quickly enters his Cadillac, slams the door, and speeds away. As he drives, he mumbles to himself. Jerry follows in another car, pulling up next to Wade's idling vehicle. He approaches and fires a gun into Wade's abdomen.\n\nThe camera then shows a broken wooden gate at an exit, indicating a forced departure. Jerry drives past an empty booth, briefly glancing at it. Inside, a leg of a body, awkwardly angled and still, is visible. Jerry continues driving, pulling into a driveway and entering a house. He sits on a foyer chair to remove his galoshes.\n\nIn another scene, Carl, now in his parked car, presses a rag to his injured jaw. He stares at something on the front seat beside him—a container filled with a substantial amount of money. He takes out a bank-wrapped wad and examines it closely.\n\nMarge, meanwhile, drives along a road, eventually pulling into a lot where she leans out her open window to order and then sits to eat a breakfast sandwich.\n\nBack at his desk, Jerry uses a blunt pencil to painstakingly enter numbers onto a form, checking a carbon copy beneath which shows thick, smudged, and illegible entries. As he works, he looks up to see Marge entering the room. Jerry freezes, his mouth agape and brow furrowed with concern. Marge settles into the chair opposite him with a sigh of relief. A silent beat passes, and Jerry trails off into silence.",
    "96": "Forrest gently places Tex on the riverbank and sprints back into the dense jungle. He then drops another wounded soldier beside Tex and dashes back toward the jungle. Seizing a third wounded soldier from the ground, he turns him over to reveal it is Dallas. With Lt. Dan hoisted over his shoulder, Forrest charges through the jungle until he stumbles and falls. Rising to his feet as Lt. Dan shouts, Forrest drags him away while Lt. Dan fires his pistol at the unseen enemy. Forrest then deposits Lt. Dan next to the other wounded soldiers on the riverbank. Grabbing Forrest's shirt in anger, Lt. Dan lets go as Forrest rises and runs back into the jungle, with Lt. Dan's shouts echoing behind him.\n\nForrest navigates through the jungle in search of Bubba, eventually slowing down to scan his surroundings more carefully. Lying on the ground, Bubba lifts his gaze, holding a palm frond over his grievous wound. Forrest removes the frond to inspect the injury, revealing that Bubba's chest has been severely damaged. As the voices of the enemy grow nearer, Forrest hefts Bubba onto his shoulders and carries him through the jungle.\n\nThe sound of approaching planes soon fills the air, their roar becoming overwhelming. Forrest glances upward in fear just as three planes swoop down, unleashing napalm that sets the jungle ablaze with massive fireballs. Carrying Bubba, Forrest runs with the fireballs exploding dangerously close behind him. The entire jungle is engulfed in flames as he finally reaches the riverbank, where Lt. Dan and the other wounded soldiers await a rescue helicopter. As Forrest looks down at Bubba, a soldier releases a smoke canister to signal the arriving helicopter overhead.\n\nTransitioning to his life story, Forrest finds himself next to a man on a bus bench. He is later seen holding two ice cream cones while being wheeled on a rolling stretcher, his bandaged buttocks comically sticking up. As he lies on his stomach, he is wheeled to his bed and observes Lt. Dan in another bed. Forrest extends an ice cream cone towards Lt. Dan, who, visibly annoyed, accepts it only to drop it into his bedpan. Forrest maneuvers himself onto his bed as a nurse reaches out to Lt. Dan. A male nurse assists Lt. Dan, whose legs have been amputated, by placing his hands on a pull-up bar and then lifting him onto a rolling bed positioned underneath by another nurse.\n\nAmidst this, a soldier reads names from a pile of letters. As Lt. Dan is wheeled away, Forrest watches him go and is handed a large stack of letters, which he examines closely.",
    "98": "Forrest continues speaking into the microphone as the crowd grows increasingly restless. Suddenly, Hilary plugs in the correct patch cord, and Forrest surveys the massive, now silent crowd. Abbie Hoffman approaches Forrest, patting him on the shoulder before raising his fist triumphantly into the air, prompting the crowd to erupt in cheers. Abbie then steps away from Forrest.\n\nIn a poignant moment, Jenny wades into the reflection pool, waving her hand in the air. Recognizing her, Forrest dashes off the stage, leaping into the crowd and running towards her. Jenny, smiling, attempts to run through the water as the crowd parts for Forrest, who splashes into the pool. Jenny rushes toward him, and the massive crowd cheers as the couple embraces in the water.\n\nAfterward, Forrest and Jenny stroll past protesters camping on the lawn. At an open window, Forrest gazes at the White House until a Black Panther named Ruben steps over and pulls down the shades. Another Black Panther, Masai, approaches Forrest, patting him down. Tension rises as Jenny pulls Forrest away from Wesley. As Wesley moans on the floor, Jenny tries to help but he knocks her hand away and stands up, clutching his bloody lip. Jenny exits as Forrest retrieves his hat, both under the stern glares of the Black Panthers. Forrest then leaves the room.\n\nOutside, protesters hold a candlelight vigil as Forrest and Jenny walk silently past the White House. Jenny touches Forrest's uniform affectionately. Later, under the rain, Jenny hitchhikes until a car stops and she, along with other girls, climbs in. Inside, a hippie offers Jenny a sugar cube of acid as they sit by a roaring fire. On the sidewalk, Jenny and two other girls sing, playing the guitar and collecting change from passersby.\n\nAs they walk through a park, Jenny, carrying a backpack, prepares to board a bus back to Berkeley. Forrest looks down at her, then removes his Medal of Honor from around his neck, placing it gently into her hand. Jenny looks up at him, and they share a heartfelt hug. Wesley waits for Jenny, who turns to join him, and they walk towards the bus entrance. Forrest smiles as Jenny glances back at him.\n\nBoarding the bus, Jenny settles into a seat and, through the window, knocks to get Forrest's attention. He turns, sees her, and she waves at him. Forrest looks up, his smile tinged with sadness. As the bus starts to pull away, Jenny gives Forrest the peace sign, and he reciprocates the gesture.",

Forrest casts a peculiar glance at John Lennon, who proceeds to light a cigarette. A guard then ushers Forrest out through a side entrance door. As Forrest steps out, he pauses, drawn by the voice of a man in a wheelchair—Lt. Dan—who appears disheveled with long hair. As Lt. Dan's wheelchair starts to slide uncontrollably down a ramp and spins on the icy ground, Forrest watches in horror as Lt. Dan crashes at the ramp's base.\n\nNavigating through bustling streets filled with taxi cabs, Forrest pushes Lt. Dan along the sidewalk.

Standing on his boat, Forrest is captivated by a deep orange and red sunset.\n\nForrest runs tirelessly along a highway, his journey reflected in a lake showing the mountains and sky. His run continues along a desert highway, bathed in the morning light's orange glow. Inside, Jenny looks out the window, her gaze meeting Forrest's as she reaches over and tenderly takes his hand.\n\nUnder the old oak tree, where Jenny is buried, Forrest struggles to hold back his tears. He watches, heart heavy, as Jenny's dad's house is demolished by a bulldozer. The focus shifts to Jenny's grave marker, which poignantly reads: JENNY GUMP July 16, 1945 -- March 22, 1982 Beloved Mother, Wife and Friend. Nearby, Forrest Jr. reads a book to Forrest, who sits next to him, but soon Forrest looks down, sobbing quietly.\n\nIn a lighter moment, Forrest attempts to teach Forrest Jr. how to play ping-pong, but the ball is served by Forrest Jr., causing Forrest to dive and miss it amusingly. They then sit together on a log by the river, fishing peacefully. Forrest's gaze returns to the grave marker, where he places a letter and fresh flowers, stepping back to look down at the grave. As he walks away, a flock of birds flies overhead and lands in the tree, prompting Forrest to turn and watch.\n\nA bus approaches them, and Forrest looks at the book in his hands. Unexpectedly, a feather from the movie's beginning drops out unnoticed. The bus stops, the door opens, and Forrest Jr. walks towards it. Forrest stands, watching as Forrest Jr. looks into the bus and at the bus driver, who is the same driver, now older, who once drove Forrest to school. Forrest Jr. looks over and waves to his father, receiving an approving nod from Forrest before he boards the bus, which then pulls away.\n\nLeft alone, Forrest stands next to the mailbox before sitting down. The camera cranes down, revealing the feather lying at Forrest's feet, which a gust of wind then picks up and carries away.",
    "106": "As Jenny places her hand gently on Forrest's, he nods, immersed in memories of their past. Continuing his conversation with the black woman, who momentarily looks up from her magazine, Forrest recalls walking with Jenny. Suddenly, a dirt clod strikes the back of Forrest's head. Jenny watches as he rubs the spot, and three young boys dismount their bikes, grabbing more rocks. Another dirt clod hits Forrest in the eye, causing him to fall backward onto the ground under the menacing glares of the boys. Jenny quickly helps him up, but the assault continues as Boy #1 and Boy #2 hurl more dirt clods, one striking Forrest in the arm.\n\nAttempting to escape, Forrest tries to run along the road, hindered by his leg braces, hobbling awkwardly as Jenny calls out to him. The bullies, Boy #1 and Boy #2, return to their bikes and join the chase after Forrest. Jenny stands helplessly watching as Forrest struggles down the dirt road. Glancing fearfully over his shoulder, Forrest pushes himself to run faster despite the braces, with the boys gaining on him. Blood begins to trickle from a cut on his head as he continues his desperate escape, the boys pedaling furiously behind him.\n\nIn a moment of breakthrough, Forrest's braces suddenly shatter, sending pieces of steel and plastic flying. Astonished, Forrest looks down at his now free legs and begins to accelerate. As he leaves the remains of his braces behind for the boys to ride over, Forrest smiles, recalling the liberation of that moment. Now far ahead, he outruns the disbelieving boys, sprinting down a driveway toward Jenny's modest house. Knocking on her door, Forrest scans the nearby field, spots Jenny, and runs to her. She grabs his hand, and together they dash into the field.\n\nJenny's father, visibly intoxicated and clutching a liquor bottle, emerges onto the porch and shouts, then staggers toward the field in pursuit. Leading Forrest deeper into a thick tobacco field, Jenny evades her father's drunken search. They transition into a corn field, with Jenny's dad still trailing behind. Desperate, Jenny drops to her knees, pulling Forrest down with her to hide from her pursuing, inebriated father.",
    "107": "Jenny is escorted by a police officer to her grandmother's trailer, where her grandmother greets her warmly and guides her inside. Jenny scales a second-floor railing to enter the house and settles into bed beside young Forrest, embracing him tenderly.\n\nAs teenagers, Forrest and Jenny stroll along a road lined with oak trees. Suddenly, a rock strikes Forrest's back, prompting them to turn. A teenage boy launches another rock as a pickup truck arrives, and he quickly jumps into the truck's bed with another boy. The truck accelerates, chasing Forrest who drops his books and dashes down the road. Jenny smartly steps aside as Forrest vaults over a five-foot fence to evade his pursuers. \n\nNarrating his life story, Forrest continues running along the road in front of the high school, still pursued by the truck with the boys pounding its roof. Forrest dashes under the field goal post and through the end zone as the crowd erupts in cheers, a football kickoff taking place simultaneously. Football players scatter across the field as Forrest, now in a University of Alabama uniform, glances up at the cheering crowd. A teammate receives the kickoff, rushes over to Forrest, and hands him the ball. The football coach, his assistants, and the Alabama team rally around Forrest, cheering as he sprints across the field, skillfully dodging and outrunning the opposing players. The coach yells and runs along the sidelines, directing Forrest towards the end zone. As Forrest makes a sharp turn towards the sidelines, two opposing players collide and fall, enabling Forrest to race into the end zone with an opposing player diving at his feet. The referee signals a touchdown, inciting wild cheers from the crowd. Unstoppable, Forrest continues running, plowing through the band members and towards the team tunnel.\n\nLater, the football coach exchanges glances with an assistant coach as an anchorman named CHET HUNTLEY appears on television. Forrest navigates through a crowd of people, approaching a young man amidst a demonstration. He then proceeds toward a schoolhouse. Meanwhile, another football coach watches a black and white television showing a newsman reporting outside the same schoolhouse. The broadcast shifts to Governor Wallace addressing General Graham.",
    "109": "As the crowd roars in excitement, Forrest dashes across the field, evading the pursuing defenders. He continues his run down the field until he triumphantly crosses into the end zone. The spectators erupt in cheers as Forrest pauses, enveloped by the sound of their jubilation. Nearby, members of the band rush towards him, gesturing wildly for him to stop and remain in the end zone. Amidst this, a group of defending players clumsily tumble over each other in their attempt to catch up.\n\nAs the crowd's cheers grow louder, Forrest glances around, absorbing the moment. The scene shifts to President Kennedy, standing proudly with an autographed football, surrounded by the All-American Team, among whom is Forrest, dressed in a suit. The players mingle around a lavishly set table, laden with a variety of foods and numerous bottles of Dr. Pepper. Forrest approaches the buffet, selects a bottle of Dr. Pepper, and has it opened by a servant. He eagerly drinks it down, eventually setting an empty bottle next to many others on the table. Feeling the effects, Forrest holds his stomach and lets out a burp.\n\nIn black and white footage, President Kennedy is seen shaking hands with members of the All-American football team. One by one, players approach him, shake his hand, and then step away. Forrest, too, shakes hands with the President, who turns and smiles warmly. Later, Forrest is in the bathroom, where he urinates, flushes after lowering the lid, and washes his hands. His attention is drawn to an autographed photo of Marilyn Monroe and another photo featuring John and his brother Bobby.\n\nArchival footage captures President Kennedy waving and smiling from a convertible in slow motion, and Robert Kennedy standing at a podium, receiving applause. The scene then shifts back to Forrest, now sitting on a bench, shaking his head thoughtfully. At a graduation ceremony, students in caps and gowns approach the podium to receive their diplomas. When Forrest's name is called, he steps forward, accepts his diploma, and receives a vigorous handshake from the dean. Scanning the crowd, Forrest sees Mrs. Gump, who is visibly emotional. They pose for a photograph in front of a large statue.\n\nA military recruiter approaches Forrest, slapping him on the shoulder and handing him some military literature. Mrs. Gump takes the diploma from Forrest as he boards an army bus. As rain pelts the outside, the bus driver yells at Forrest. Inside, Forrest tries to sit in the first available seat, but the recruit there refuses him. He moves to the next seat, but the second recruit slides over, blocking his attempt. Forrest moves further back, his posture reminiscent of his nervous first bus ride to school years earlier.",
    "114": "Phyllis emerges from her house, closing the door behind her and gazing toward the railway tracks. She then approaches a parked car, opens its rear door, and leans inside. Inside, she uncovers a body hidden beneath a rug, her eyes fixated on the sight as she absentmindedly begins folding the rug.\n\nThe sound of hurried footsteps increases until Neff appears, breathless. He reaches Phyllis and gestures toward the tracks. He then reaches into the car and begins pulling the corpse out by the armpits. Phyllis, maintaining her composure, reaches past him to remove the hat from the deceased's head. She then turns to leave, releases the car's hand brake, and shifts it into reverse.\n\nAs the car starts moving, its headlights off, it backs up, turns around, and heads back along the dirt road from which it came. During this, Phyllis and Neff engage in a conversation, their lips moving but their words inaudible. They eventually stop talking, with Phyllis staring straight ahead.\n\nThe sedan then enters the scene and halts without pulling to the curb. Neff starts to exit the vehicle, turns back to Phyllis, who leans toward him, wrapping her arms around him for a kiss in which Neff remains passive.\n\nLater, inside a building, Neff ascends. The sounds of telephone and door bells are heard. Neff, still holding cards, removes them from their position. He then emerges from a bedroom dressed in a light grey suit, sans tie, the same outfit he wore before the murder. He buttons his jacket, surveys the room, and exits through the corridor door.\n\nOutside, fifteen to twenty cars now occupy the parking area. Charlie, the attendant, has cleaned Neff's car and is polishing its glass and metal surfaces. Spotting Neff, Charlie straightens up and begins walking up the ramp toward the garage entrance.\n\nNeff appears at the top of the ramp and starts walking down the street at a leisurely pace, with the camera preceding him. He covers about ten to fifteen yards. Initially, his footsteps are sharply audible on the sidewalk, echoing through the deserted street. However, as he continues, these sounds gradually diminish until they disappear completely. After walking a few more steps in silence, Neff becomes aware of the absence of sound. He halts abruptly, turns back to look, and the camera stops with him. He remains motionless for a moment, then faces the camera again, a look of horror now evident on his face. He resumes walking, with the camera moving ahead of him, yet his steps remain eerily silent.",
    "117": "Neff emerges from a building, briefcase in hand, alongside several others. As he strides through the anteroom, Lola, who has risen upon spotting him, intercepts him before he can pass her by unnoticed. Startled, Neff gazes at her briefly. He then courteously opens a swing door and gestures for her to proceed ahead of him. As Lola walks past, Neff's eyes narrow, his mind clouded with uneasy thoughts. He guides her towards his office, maintaining a steady pace beside her as the camera follows. At the entrance to his office, Neff again opens the door, allowing Lola to step inside first. Inside, Lou Schwartz, another salesman, is busy at his desk. After Neff and Lola enter, Neff momentarily leaves the room. Upon his return, he fixes a tense stare on Lola. She turns away, facing the window to hide her tears from him. Moved, Neff approaches her.\n\nLater, Neff and Lola are seen dining at a table on Olvera Street, surrounded by the usual bustle of street peddlers and musicians. The scene shifts to them driving along the beach near Santa Monica. Neff sports a light summer suit, starkly contrasting with Lola's somber attire. She shares a story with him, occasionally laughing, though their conversation is silent to the audience. A close shot reveals Neff at the wheel, only half-attentive to Lola's words.\n\nNeff, now without his briefcase but wearing his hat, approaches Keyes' office. His pace slows as he nears the door, a look of surprise crossing his face upon seeing a familiar figure seated nearby. It's Jackson, the man from the train's observation platform, identifiable by his Stetson hat and cigar. Engrossed in a file folder, Jackson does not notice Neff, who quickly composes himself and proceeds to enter Keyes' office. Inside, Neff closes the door behind him. Keyes, sans coat and chewing a cigar as per his habit, springs up from the couch with agility. He points a finger at Neff and then strides over to open the door, allowing Jackson to enter with the file folder. Jackson gestures towards his cigar and then the folder he's carrying. Keyes, realizing his oversight, introduces Jackson to Neff. He then picks up his desk phone and speaks into it, his voice a low murmur in the background as Jackson moves to confront Neff. Keyes eventually joins them. After their discussion, Keyes opens the door for Jackson, who exits while searching his pockets for matches to light his cigar.",
    "119": "As the cylinder continues to revolve, the voice ceases, and only the whirring of the needle on the empty record persists. Finally, he recalls to reattach the horn. Neff emerges from Keyes' office and proceeds at a leisurely pace back towards the reception room entrance. There, he pauses and gazes through the glass doors. With all the employees having departed, Neff finds himself completely alone. As he moves to exit, he suddenly halts, his face illuminating with the thrill of a new idea. He swiftly pivots and strides into his own office. \n\nCrossing over to his desk, Neff lifts the telephone and dials a number. After hanging up, he stands beside the desk, his face set in a grim expression. He retrieves a handkerchief, wiping the sweat from his forehead and palms—a gesture that symbolically seems an attempt to cleanse himself of the murder. Over his face, the commentary unfolds as the lights switch on.\n\nPhyllis descends the stairs, clad in white lounging pajamas, carrying a small, heavy object concealed within a scarf in her right hand. She reaches the front door, slightly opens it, and adjusts the catch to allow external access. She then extinguishes the porch and hall lights before moving towards the still-lit living room. Neff enters through the arch and approaches her slowly. He sits on the arm of the davenport, near her, but soon rises to his feet, pausing momentarily to listen to the music. Phyllis simply stares at him. He then proceeds to the window, quietly closing it and drawing the curtain. Advancing a few more steps towards her, he stops once more.\n\nPhyllis remains silent, her expression one of torment. Neff continues until he stands close to her. Gently, he takes the gun from her unresisting hand. Phyllis, in complete surrender, wraps her arms around him. Neff pulls her close, and as their kiss ends, a realization dawns in her eyes that this is the final moment. Suddenly, gunshots—once, then twice—ring out. Phyllis trembles in his embrace, her eyes filling with tears as her head drops limply against his shoulder. With tender care, Neff lifts her and carries her to the davenport, laying her down almost gently. The moonlight streaming through the French doors illuminates her anklet, which Neff gazes at for the last time before slowly turning away. As he does, he reaches inside his coat, pulling out a hand stained with blood.",
    "113": "Neff briskly passes the night watchman without a word, heading straight for the elevator. As Neff approaches the elevator, the night watchman secures the door behind him and follows. Once Neff steps into the elevator, he is visibly pale and haggard, yet maintains a stoic expression as the night watchman joins him and pulls the lever. The elevator doors close, and it ascends until the doors open again.\n\nStepping out, Neff finds himself in a dimly lit reception area facing the frosted glass doors marked \"PACIFIC ALL-RISK INSURANCE COMPANY - FOUNDED 1906 - MAIN OFFICE.\" A faint light glows beyond these doors. With a heavy gait, Neff crosses the reception room, pushes the doors open, and enters a balcony that encircles the area, overlooking the bustling eleventh floor filled with desks, typewriters, and various office machines.\n\nThe twelfth floor remains dark, illuminated only by the light filtering up from below. Two women are busy cleaning; one sweeps the floor while the other rearranges chairs. Neff, with a faint smile, moves away from the balcony railing and proceeds past several offices toward a glass door labeled \"27\" and bearing the names HENRY B. ANDERSON, WALTER NEFF, LOUIS L. SCHWARTZ. He opens the door and enters an office containing three desks, filing cabinets, a typewriter on a stand, a dictaphone on a fixed stand with a record rack underneath, and telephones on each desk.\n\nInside, Neff turns on a desk lamp. Overcome by exhaustion, he leans back in his chair, eyes closing and cold sweat beading on his face. After a moment, he slowly opens his eyes and looks at his left shoulder. With effort, he adjusts his overcoat, unbuttons his jacket, and loosens his tie and shirt. He pauses to catch his breath, eyes closed, then reaches into his shirt pocket for a pack of cigarettes. Upon extracting it, he notices blood on the pack. Rolling back to his desk, he empties the cigarettes onto the surface; some are stained with blood, others are clean. Selecting a clean one, he places it between his lips, lights it, and takes a deep drag, exhaling through his nose.\n\nStill seated in the swivel chair, Neff pulls himself over to the dictaphone. He lifts the horn from its bracket, and the device emits a low buzzing sound. After pressing the button switch, the buzzing stops and the record begins to revolve. Neff starts to speak into the dictaphone but soon pauses, setting the horn down on the desk.",
    "121": "In the opening scene, a man retrieves his smoldering cigarette from an ashtray, inhales a few times, and then extinguishes it decisively. He then lifts a horn to his lips once more. As his monologue continues, the scene gradually transitions to a different setting.\n\nThe new location features a street lined with palm trees, surrounded by middle-class residences, primarily in Spanish architectural style. The neighborhood buzzes with activity: children engage in a game of catch, tossing a baseball between two front lawns, while an ice cream wagon leisurely rolls down the block. Amidst this scene, Neff's coupe maneuvers past the ice cream wagon and pulls up in front of one of the Spanish-style homes. Neff exits the vehicle, briefcase in hand, his hat casually tilted back on his head, moving with a confident and energetic stride. He approaches the house, verifies the address, ascends the front porch, and rings the bell.\n\nUpon entering the home, Neff finds himself amidst decor that embodies the Spanish craperoo style, consistent throughout the house. A striking wrought-iron staircase spirals down from the upper floor, adorned by a fringed Mexican shawl draped over the landing. A large tapestry adorns one of the walls. As Neff surveys his surroundings, his gaze lifts to find Phyllis Dietrichson peering down at him from above. In her early thirties, Phyllis stands wrapped in a large bath-towel that clings to her enticing figure, ending just above her knees, with no other garments visible. Observing her, Neff removes his hat. Phyllis, aware of her unconventional attire, quickly assesses her towel costume before turning away with an effortless grace.\n\nAs Phyllis disappears from view, Neff, still looking upward, exchanges words with the maid before moving through an archway. The maid departs in the opposite direction. In the next room, Neff tosses his briefcase onto a plush davenport, followed by his hat. He scans the room, then approaches a baby grand piano, over which a sleazy Spanish shawl is draped, and where two cabinet photographs stand slightly offset from each other. He examines the photos: one of Mr. Dietrichson, a robust man in his early fifties, sporting glasses and an air of a Rotarian, and the other of Lola Dietrichson, a nineteen-year-old in a sheer party dress, her eyes reflecting a longing expression. Neff then paces back and forth across the rug, his attention catching on a wrinkled corner. With his back to the archway, the sound of high heels clicking on the staircase catches his ear. Turning toward the sound, he looks through the arch to see Phyllis Dietrichson descending the stairs. Initially, only her feet come into view, adorned with pom-pom slippers and a gold anklet on her left ankle. As she continues down, the camera pulls back to reveal her fully, now clad in a pale blue summer dress. Neff moves to the davenport, retrieves some policies from his briefcase, while Phyllis, having turned away from a mirror, settles into a large chair, her legs curled up to the side, the anklet prominently displayed.",
    "122": "Phyllis offers a faint smile and discreetly conceals her anklet beneath her dress. She then stands up, pacing back and forth, gradually losing focus. Meanwhile, he reviews the documents in his grasp. Phyllis halts her pacing and resumes her seat in the original position. His gaze once again settles on the anklet. Neff grabs his hat and briefcase, and together they proceed toward the archway. He exits, handing over his hat and briefcase to her before continuing onward to a door marked with a sign, which he opens with a grin and steps inside.\n\nThe office Neff enters is a minor executive space, not particularly neat, featuring a large desk in one corner, a quality carpet, multiple chairs, a filing cabinet along a wall, and a dictaphone perched on the desk's edge. Across the desk, Sam Gorlopis, a towering and somewhat brutish man standing at six feet three, clad in a dirty work shirt and corduroy pants, with untidy hair and a broad face accentuated by small, piggish eyes, sits. He clutches a sweat-soaked hat on his knee with a hairy hand. Noticing Neff at the doorway, Gorlopis cautiously shifts his gaze sideways to Keyes. He then forcefully strikes his stomach, causing Gorlopis to recoil from the blow. A blank form is placed before him, and after a moment's hesitation, Gorlopis signs it laboriously. He leaves, shutting the door behind him. Keyes removes a cigar stub from his mouth, turning it slowly in the flame of a lit match, then turns his attention to Neff, who exits still wearing a grin.\n\nNeff departs from Keyes' office, making his way back along the balcony amidst the bustling activity of secretaries moving in and out of various doors. He enters his own office, where Anderson, a salesman, is seated at a desk, diligently filling out a report. Neff proceeds to his desk, briefly scanning some mail before sitting and flipping through his desk calendar.\n\nThe camera follows Phyllis Dietrichson's feet and ankles as she descends the stairs, the sound of her high heels clicking against the tiles. Her anklet sparkles on her leg with each step. As she reaches the entrance hall and continues towards the front door, her full figure comes into view. She is dressed in a vibrant print dress cinched at the hips with a wide sash. She opens the door to find Neff standing outside, dressed in a sport coat and flannel slacks. He removes his hat and offers a slight smile before entering. Phyllis leads him toward the living room, and they pass through the archway. She then moves to a low tea table positioned in front of a davenport, set with tall glasses, ice cubes, lemon, and a teapot. She pours herself a glass of tea.",
    "123": "As Neff scans the room, the woman prepares a glass of tea for him. She then passes the tea to him, and he retrieves his hat before heading out the door. She watches him leave, and Neff forcefully closes the front door, briskly walks to his car, and drives away. At a drive-in, a car hop attaches a tray to Neff's car door and serves him a bottle of beer while he sits behind the wheel.\n\nLater, Neff is seen at a bowling alley. Although he attempts to focus as he releases the bowling ball, his thoughts are clearly elsewhere. The scene shifts to a six-story building located in the Normandie-Wilshire district, which includes a basement garage. As light rain begins to fall, the camera pans up the building's facade to the top floor windows.\n\nInside one of the top-floor apartments, Neff stands by a window, his coat removed and tie loosened, as raindrops patter against the glass. Growing impatient, he turns away, paces back and forth, and grabs a golf club from a nearby caddy bag. He swings it a few times, tosses it onto the couch, and continues his pacing. He then approaches the door and opens it.\n\nA woman, carrying only a handbag, stands before him. Neff silently observes her, his gaze dropping to her empty hands. She enters, and he shuts the door, then switches on a standing lamp. She begins to remove her coat, which Neff takes and drapes over a chair. Phyllis, now moving to the window, gazes out through the rain-streaked glass. Neff gently takes her wrist, draws her close, and kisses her. Her arms encircle him tightly. After a moment, he pulls back slightly, still holding her near, then releases her and moves towards the dinette area.\n\nThe dinette is small, featuring a table and chairs, with a low glass-and-china cabinet separating it from the kitchen, which is typical for an apartment house, containing a stove, ice-box, sink, and other standard appliances. Neff goes to the ice-box, followed by Phyllis. He gestures towards the china closet, retrieves a tray of ice cubes from the refrigerator, and runs them under hot water. Phyllis now holds the glasses, handing them to him. He adds ice to the glasses and reaches for a whiskey bottle atop the china closet. Neff then passes a filled glass to Phyllis, and they head back to the living room.\n\nReaching the davenport, they sit close to each other. Neff wraps his arms around Phyllis and kisses her, holding her tightly. Their heads touch, side by side, as the camera slowly begins to pull back.",
    "130": "As the narrative unfolds, a man's authoritative voice compels others to descend, initiating a powerful scene of resistance. Gandhi, suddenly inspired, pivots and shouts with conviction as the thunderous approach of horses grows louder. Miners follow suit, some lying face-up with hands shielding their eyes, others pressing their faces into the ground and covering their heads, all in anticipation of the advancing cavalry.\n\nFrom the sergeant's perspective, the camera closes in rapidly, reaching the miners lying prone. A focused shot reveals Gandhi, arms crossed defensively over his face, eyes fixed upward, a mix of fear and determination etched on his features. The horses, confronted by the human barrier, falter; they rear up, veer off course, and refuse to trample the protesters. Amidst this chaos, the sergeant is thrown from his horse, landing with a heavy thud. He scrambles to his feet, seething with anger, and chases after his mount. Upon remounting, he is further infuriated by the sound of mocking laughter around him.\n\nHis command, though filled with anger, resonates powerfully due to his influence, causing the miners to lower themselves once more. The sergeant, directing his horse, charges directly at Gandhi. With a deliberate and resigned demeanor, Gandhi kneels and then lies flat, hands protectively covering his head, bracing for the impact of the horse's hooves. Close-up footage captures the horse's head, its eyes wild as it swerves yet again, unable to comply with the sergeant's furious commands to charge.\n\nIn a wider shot, the sergeant, still mounted and angry, surveys the scene of the sprawling miners and his own mounted police, who mill uncertainly before them. Frustrated, he turns his horse sharply and gallops back towards the factories. Gandhi, alongside Singh and Tyeb Mohammed, watches the horses retreat. In the distance, a car with a civilian returns, and as it approaches, the sergeant maneuvers past it, his police realigning themselves across the road.\n\nThe miners, undeterred, resume their march, their chants echoing with renewed vigor. Meanwhile, in a contrasting setting, a congregation listens to Charlie with evident disapproval and murmurs of agreement to his detractors. Seated under the pulpit, the clergyman who allowed Charlie to speak remains embarrassed yet firm in his decision. As Charlie presses on, more members of the congregation stand and leave the church in protest, though a few remain staunchly in their seats.\n\nThe scene shifts again, this time to Gandhi, who is seen navigating through a line of prisoners waiting for soup. The line meanders through a sea of inmates, some holding bowls and eating, others still trying to join the queue. As Gandhi approaches two stone blocks supporting large barrels of soup, he recognizes Khan distributing the soup from one of them.",
    "132": "As the movie unfolds, an officer commanding and the Guard of Honor stand ready, awaiting the arrival of a significant figure. A young Englishman observes them with a quizzical expression. Nearby, the General, having taken the salute, proceeds to inspect the troops, accompanied by the stirring music of a military band. Amidst this, the young Englishman becomes aware of a well-dressed Indian who appears to be half-listening to their conversation. When their eyes meet, the Indian nods slightly and then moves away discreetly. Another Englishman, witnessing this interaction, grimaces and looks away.\n\nThe scene shifts to a less opulent gangplank extending from the ship's aft section, where Third Class passengers disembark and are greeted by a large, excited crowd of Indians on shore, separated from the rest by a wire fence. The crowd's excitement is palpable, directed at an unseen figure descending the gangplank. Meanwhile, the young Englishman cautiously glances back at the well-dressed Indian.\n\nThe focus then turns to Gandhi, who, smiling amidst the crowd, tries to move forward but is engaged by an Indian journalist. His speech carries an uncertainty, a tentativeness he hadn't shown in South Africa, overwhelmed as he is by the warm reception. An English journalist catches him as he turns, and an exuberant woman places a garland around his shoulders. Behind him, an Indian reporter has cornered Ba, who joins her hands in acknowledgment of a garland placed around her neck before following Gandhi, guided by Charlie.\n\nThe young Nehru, visibly amused by the surrounding excitement, leads Gandhi through the crowd to a flower-covered platform adorned with a banner proclaiming \"THE CONGRESS PARTY.\" As they reach the first step, another garland is draped over Gandhi's shoulders, and, somewhat embarrassed, he ascends the platform. The crowd erupts in cheers, yet the sound of the distant military band signals the troops preparing to march off. Gandhi surveys the crowd before finally speaking, performing the pranam, and descending the steps. Despite the crowd's slight disappointment, they cheer and applaud.\n\nNehru stands next to a heavy-set, well-dressed man named Patel. He then slams the door of a gleaming, top-down Rolls Royce touring car after seating Gandhi beside Patel, taking Gandhi's knapsack. An Indian chauffeur sits in front as the crowd still swarms around them. Gandhi looks back apprehensively for Ba, while Nehru grins boyishly, partly to comfort and partly amused by Gandhi's evident confusion. With Gandhi still looking back anxiously, the car starts moving.\n\nAs the car drives along the street, Gandhi, surprised to see the crowds cheering for him, waves tentatively. Patel, seated next to him, also waves but watches Gandhi with a critical eye.",
    "134": "The camera swiftly follows a train racing along a river's edge, with sunlight reflecting and shimmering on the train's windows. High in the sky, the sun oversees the train, which has come to a halt by the river. From the Second Class coaches, an English clergyman cautiously dips his toe into the water, while children of British enlisted soldiers frolic nearby, their faces glowing with joy as they splash around. On the opposite side of the river, near the Third Class coaches, a group of Indian women squat at the water's edge, diligently washing clothes. Some of these women have infants secured on their backs, and a few small children stand close by, observing. As they continue their washing ritual, their attention shifts to the train's passengers.\n\nAmong the Third Class passengers, Gandhi stands with Ba and Charlie. Charlie, with his trousers rolled up, engages in a playful splashing game with a slender Indian boy. Meanwhile, Gandhi is seen soaking a large white head cloth in the river, but his gaze is drawn to the women across the river. Their bodies are emaciated, and their clothes, which seemed ordinary from afar, are revealed to be tattered rags, layered one over another. Gandhi's stare lingers on them for a moment, a poignant pause.\n\nThe scene shifts to the train climbing through verdant, hilly terrain, intercut with views of a boy and a buffalo running a massive grinding wheel, and farmers working in terraced fields as the train accelerates. Gandhi leans out of a window in a Third Class coach, observing as other passengers ahead also look out; some have already disembarked. As they approach, it becomes clear that a military train consisting of an engine and two cars has derailed in front of them. A small cavalry troop, British and led by a viciously angry commander, advances slowly towards Gandhi's train.\n\nElsewhere, Nehru accepts an iced drink from a servant and shakes his head with a wistful expression. The camera then captures the train as it moves past to the Third Class section, which appears overwhelmed by people. Individuals cling to the outside of each door, while many others sit on the central wooden planks on the roofs of the two coaches. Gandhi and Charlie, holding onto the outside of the coach through the door, seem to thoroughly enjoy the experience, though Ba, cramped inside the coach, finds no humor in the situation as she grips one of Gandhi's arms.\n\nThe camera shifts focus, zooming in on Jinnah, whose passionate speech captivates the audience, eliciting cheers from them. Newspaper cameramen swarm around the platform, capturing photos of Jinnah, as Patel steps forward from the back of the platform, clapping in approval.",
    "148": "In the courtroom, Gandhi steps onto the prisoner's stand, his gaze sweeping the room with a mix of surprise and emotion stirred by the ongoing demonstration. His eyes lift to meet the judge's, and for a fleeting moment, they hold each other's gaze. The judge acknowledges Gandhi with a subtle bow, which Gandhi returns before the judge takes his seat. Amidst this, reporters exchange incredulous shrugs as they settle back into their seats.\n\nThe Advocate General begins his address, reading from a folded journal, causing a ripple of shock through the courtroom. He flashes a smile tinged with disdain before turning to the judge, who nods in acknowledgment. The Advocate General then turns his attention to the empty defense table and then to Gandhi, presenting what seems like a cruel challenge to the evidently humane Broomfield. As this unfolds, reporters continue to scribble, their eyes occasionally flicking to the judge, whose expression of doubt subtly reflects the broader British stance on India.\n\nThe judge removes his glasses with a sober air, momentarily staring at them before looking up at Gandhi, his respect for the man palpably evident. A collective gasp fills the courtroom, followed by silence as the clerk writes the sentence in his notebook. The judge then lowers his gaze, meticulously folding and refolding his glasses before rising without making eye contact with anyone. The court stands as he walks stiffly to his chambers. Once there, he stares at Broomfield, his face now displaying the respect he holds for him.\n\nYears later, from a vantage point high above the hills, we see an early 1930s Morris Minor traveling along a road. Inside the car, a now-older reporter from the New York Times, first seen as a young man in South Africa, turns to look back at the scene with intrigue. From his perspective, we see an Indian woman leading a tall camel laden with sacks of produce. Accompanying her are two young girls in tattered saris and an eight-year-old boy leading a smaller camel, all of them watching the car pass by. Collins, also in the car, glances at the reporter in surprise as he maneuvers the vehicle around another group of camels heading toward the port, his eyes fixed straight ahead.\n\nIn the cool, shadowy interior of a temple, Walker and Collins sit alone, captivated by the scene unfolding before them. Gandhi and Ba are repeating their marriage ceremony, drawing closer to each other before the temple's altar. As they do, Walker occasionally jots notes, yet his eyes remain fixed on the couple, who are partly lost in the memories and echoes of a moment significant only to them.",
    "150": "Irwin, having listened intently, begins to grasp the situation. The principal secretary pales visibly. Irwin exchanges a glance with his aide-de-camp, then starts pacing, deep in thought. After a moment of contemplation, it's the general who breaks the silence. Irwin turns toward him, and this interaction solidifies his decision. He is both concerned to the point of anger yet certain enough to remain dogmatic.\n\nSuddenly, a throng of people emerges from behind an embankment at the top of the steps leading up from the river. The camera subtly rises with their motion, revealing these individuals as the vanguard of a long stream of humanity that stretches back across the river to the distant city outskirts. Around the ashram, numerous fires burn as people cook breakfast, some pack knapsacks for the journey, and others scatter leaves along the path leading from the ashram. A quiet buzz of activity emanates from outside the building.\n\nGandhi, grinning, catches the eye of Mirabehn who is massaging his legs. He then smiles warmly and turns toward his bungalow. Ba and Mirabehn, along with Desai, stand watching. Gandhi holds their gaze for a moment before turning and starting forward. Pyarelal quickly joins him, and the marchers follow suit. The crowd along the path is thinner here. On one side, two police cars are parked, and near them stand several policemen: a British officer, a British sergeant, and four Indian constables. As Gandhi approaches, Walker moves up beside him. Some newspaper photographers jog behind to capture the moment of Gandhi's arrest. Among the reporters, Collins is visible.\n\nFocusing on Gandhi and Walker, with Pyarelal just behind them, they all glance ahead at the nearing police. Walker manages an uneasy smile as they come close to the police. Gandhi nods amiably to the officers as he passes by them. Walker, keeping an eye on the police, begins to realize they may not act. He hastens to rejoin Gandhi, still watching the police. Gandhi glances at him. Walker, also carrying a knapsack, nods politely to the British police officer at the end of the line. Walker stops, allowing the procession to pass him as he observes the British officer and scribbles notes in his notebook. Collins pauses beside him.\n\nA dusty path leads to a small village. Lining both sides of the track are peasants holding flower petals and leaves, all looking eagerly down the road. Behind them, the village is adorned with the green, white, and saffron colors of Independence. At the forefront, two large policemen stand with arms akimbo, their stance imposing and threatening, though somewhat undermined by the children weaving around them.",
    "153": "A young and vigorous man, swirling on the ground as if preparing to retaliate, faces an attack from Nehru. Nehru lunges at him, only to be met with a brutal strike from a lathi across his head. Feeling the side of his head, Nehru discovers blood soaking his hand. Struggling to his feet, he confronts the policeman responsible for the assault.\n\nMeanwhile, the Viceroy contemplates the situation with a favorable disposition. The senior police officer is struck by the chilling directness of the unfolding events. He glances uncertainly at Irwin and the principal secretary before turning to leave, only to be halted by Irwin's almost offhand comment. The senior police officer then fixes his gaze on Irwin.\n\nThe scene shifts to the entrance of the Dharasana Salt Works, marked by a stockade-like structure surrounded by barbed wire. Six British and two Indian police officers lead a large troop of Indian policemen, standing tensely before their opposition. The camera pans across a sloping dip to reveal a massive group of volunteers, lined up and equally tense, ready to confront the police. Off to one side, Walker climbs onto the back of Collins' car, watching the two groups with near terror at the impending clash. Collins, leaning against the car nearby, shares Walker's appalled anticipation. Two other reporters stand close by.\n\nFrom Walker's perspective, Mirabehn and some Indian women are seen quietly setting up stretchers and bandage tables near a group of tents where the volunteers are housed. Walker's attention returns to the two opposing groups at the Salt Works entrance, the air thick with tension.\n\nA man approaches the chief police officer politely, then proceeds down the dip towards the gate where the police, armed with lathis, await. A series of shots show Azad leading the first row of volunteers down and up the dip. Intercut scenes capture Walker, frozen in place, watching the inevitable onslaught as the British police commanding officer, struggling to control his emotions, gives the first order.\n\nBack in shadows, Irwin sits behind his desk, still in shock, staring at Gandhi. He faces Gandhi stiffly.\n\nThe sound of a camera whirring transitions to a wide, slightly under-cranked screen reminiscent of old newsreels. Gandhi, Mirabehn, and Gandhi's secretary, Desai, are seen waving goodbye from the deck of their departing ship. Mirabehn holds the tether of a goat, and all three smile at the camera, embodying the spirit of voyagers everywhere.",
    "154": "In the East End of London, a jubilant crowd greets Mahatma Gandhi as he stands on the steps of Kingsley Hall. By his side, the gray-haired Charlie Andrews radiates a possessive pride. Transitioning scenes, Gandhi, clad in his traditional dhoti, waves to a smaller crowd while entering the gates of Buckingham Palace. He then takes his place at a conference table surrounded by formally and elaborately dressed delegates, including some Maharajahs. The session begins with the sound of a gavel, followed by Ramsay MacDonald's opening address in his white suit and black-ribboned pince-nez.\n\nIn another setting, Gandhi sits in a wicker chair with Nehru and Patel leaning against a railing, while Azad and Kripalani sit on the floor as Gandhi does. As the meeting concludes, Gandhi rises and begins to move towards the steps. He pauses to exchange a wry, gentle smile with Patel before looking over at Jinnah and shrugging dismissively. Jinnah, visibly less philosophical, watches with burning anger as Gandhi approaches a young girl with an injured goat.\n\nThe scene shifts to Gandhi walking amidst a stream of passengers exiting the Third Class section of a train. Struggling behind him are Ba and Mirabehn, with Desai and Pyarelal completing their small group. At the station, a British captain stands before a platoon of Indian troops. As Gandhi nears, a British Lt. Colonel and his Adjutant, a Captain, step forward from the ranks. Gandhi, looking up at them and then at the troops, shakes his head with a weary grin. The Colonel signals to his troops, and as a detail approaches, the adjutant speaks gently to Ba, who responds with a belligerent stare, leaving the adjutant flummoxed.\n\nThe Colonel and his adjutant then stride toward the station's exit, followed by a detail of six soldiers accompanying Gandhi. The camera follows, revealing another detail of six soldiers accompanying Ba, and yet another with Mirabehn.\n\nSwitching scenes, a jeep driven by an American lieutenant with Margaret Bourke-White, dressed in an American War Correspondent's uniform, bounces along a road. As they pass the camera, it pans to reveal the walls of a palace ahead. Bourke-White absorbs the sight, her gaze intense, driven by both professional curiosity and personal sensitivity.\n\nThe final scene shows Gandhi seated by a window, its grillwork substituting for bars, spinning in a shaft of light. His focus drifts as the sound of a camera clicking and the rustle of movement are heard. His hair, once half-gray in London, is now fully white, marking the passage of time and the weight of his experiences.",
    "158": "Gandhi, accompanied by Nehru and Azad, advances forward with Pyarelal closely following behind them. Earlier, Azad and Pyarelal had emerged onto the porch behind Nehru. As Gandhi approaches a car, a Hindu youth brandishing a black flag calls out to him. The group is struck with awe and a sense of timidity in Gandhi's presence, transforming the atmosphere of their gathering entirely. Gandhi's gaze sweeps over the youth and the line of others standing there, his stern look betraying his fatigue and strain. Lowering his head, he proceeds to the car where Kallenbach is ready at the door to assist him, followed by Nehru, Azad, and Pyarelal. As they enter the vehicle, the car is parked next to two trucks that had transported the youths. In the back seat, two men are visible, one of them being Prakash, who would later be present at Gandhi's assassination.\n\nMeanwhile, Jinnah stands on a small balcony of a grand room, gazing down slightly superciliously. He is, as always, impeccably dressed. From his vantage point, he observes Gandhi sitting on the floor of a spacious room, just lifting his head from prayer. Nearby, Nehru, Patel, and Azad also occupy the same side of the room as Gandhi and rise from their prayers as Jinnah descends the steps toward them. Gandhi hesitates before starting to speak, while Jinnah straightens himself, his vanity visibly stirred by the prospect. Jinnah studies Gandhi momentarily to gauge his sincerity, and once convinced, he slowly turns his attention to Nehru, Patel, and Azad. Nehru exchanges a glance with Patel, both surprised by the offer and lacking the sentiment that Gandhi holds. Nehru looks hesitantly at Gandhi, the truth of the situation undeniable. Gandhi’s eyes droop in despair, reflecting the collapse of his last hope and faith.\n\nThe scene shifts to a platform where Mountbatten and Nehru stand in the foreground. A band plays the Indian National Anthem with vigor as a massive crowd roars in response to the raising of India's green, white, and saffron flag on the flagpole. On another occasion, Jinnah and a British plenipotentiary are on a platform, with a band playing Pakistan's new national anthem loudly. The crowd responds with thunderous applause as Pakistan's flag, white and green with a white crescent, is hoisted up the flagpole. Later, a small flagpole stands empty, its rope dangling and flapping loosely.\n\nGandhi is seen sitting alone on the porch of his bungalow, engrossed in spinning. The gentle hum of his spinning wheel fills the air. Inside the house, Mirabehn can just be seen, also spinning, but the rest of the ashram appears deserted, leaving Gandhi in solitude.",
    "161": "The camera sweeps over a large, lively crowd, passing by loudspeakers mounted on poles. Amidst the throng, groups of surly, young rowdies linger at the edges, while the camera glides over the heads of the attentive audience towards a stage where Nehru is delivering a speech. Seated on the floor behind him are Azad, Suhrawardy, and others.\n\nIn another scene, Suhrawardy, a prominent Muslim leader, is seen leaning against a wall, his body tense as he observes an unseen action with evident strain. Nearby, five men, dressed in black trousers and vests, confront Gandhi. Their muscular arms are adorned with thongs, accentuating their strength, and despite the dirtiness of their attire and themselves, they lay down their weapons—knives and guns—at Gandhi's feet. From a rooftop, Mirabehn, Azad, Pyarelal, the doctor, and others watch this unfolding event, a mix of fascination and fear evident on their faces.\n\nGandhi, intensely focused, scrutinizes these men, refusing to accept any superficial gestures. As the men, known as Goondas, stand to leave, they glance towards Suhrawardy, who offers them a tight smile. They begin to depart, but one man, Nahari, hesitates. Suddenly, Nahari lunges towards Gandhi, pulling a piece of flat Indian bread (chapati) from his trousers and forcefully throwing it at Gandhi. Mirabehn and Azad instinctively move towards Nahari, who appears incredibly strong and unpredictably unstable. However, Gandhi, with a trembling hand, signals them to stop.\n\nNahari's face is a twisted mask of emotion, blending anger and a childlike fear, yet there's an undeniable menacing instability in his demeanor. Gandhi, seemingly understanding Nahari's inner turmoil, stares at him breathlessly, as if Nahari has revealed a deep, self-inflicted wound. Reflexively, Gandhi gestures to the height of his son, then locks eyes with Suhrawardy before returning his gaze to Nahari, who is now sobbing angrily, as if contemplating harming Gandhi in revenge. For a long moment, Gandhi confronts Nahari's pain and rage.\n\nDespite sneering, a flicker of desperate curiosity crosses Nahari's face. Gandhi responds by raising his hand to the height Nahari had indicated for his son. Nahari listens, his face showing a brief moment of possible redemption, though it does not fully dispel his inner darkness. Light now focuses on Nahari, whose face stiffens as he struggles to suppress his emotions. He turns to leave but manages only a step before turning back, collapsing to his knees, and sobbing uncontrollably as he bows his head to Gandhi's feet in a traditional Hindu gesture symbolizing a son's respect for his father. Gandhi, after a moment, reaches out and touches the top of Nahari's head in a gesture of acceptance and peace.\n\nMeanwhile, nearby, trucks filled with riot squads equipped with shields and truncheons are present but remain passive, simply waiting.",
    "164": "In the midst of a tumultuous scene, a woman struggles to break free, but a constable grips her firmly. Amidst the chaos, the sergeant turns his attention away from the disturbance to witness Gandhi, blood trickling from his head, struggling back to his knees. Gandhi reaches for another card, and the crowd, along with a newspaper reporter, watches intently. Ba, overwhelmed with anguish, observes as Gandhi lifts the card. The sergeant, though visibly angry, manages to keep his emotions somewhat under control, yet after a brief hesitation, Gandhi drops the card into a basket. Despite nearly stopping, the sergeant strikes Gandhi again, a flicker of distaste at his own actions crossing his face as Gandhi sags. Ba's tears flow freely, reflecting her deep distress, while the reporter continues to observe without jotting down notes. Khan, positioned near the paddy wagon, watches in awe. Gandhi, now bleeding profusely from his head, rises to his knees once more, gasping for breath, and fumbles for another card. His fingers finally grasp one. The sergeant, his face a mask of confusion and uncertainty, watches as Gandhi, with painful effort, lifts the card and holds it over the fire before dropping it into the basket. The sergeant reluctantly strikes again with his billy club, showing a clear hesitation. The crowd holds its breath, and the reporter remains fixated. The sergeant, taking a deep breath while gripping the club, bites his lip as he sees Gandhi, feebly lifting his head, his trembling hands stained with his own blood, reaching for yet another card.\n\nLater, in a gas-lit, overly furnished Victorian room, Ba gently helps Gandhi remove his suit coat, her eyes filled with fear as she looks at the bandages on his head and along the side of his face. Gandhi sits cautiously on the bed, where several newspapers, some in English, are spread out. Ba reaches out tenderly to touch the bandages on Gandhi's head. Before Gandhi can respond, there's a knock at the door. A proud, small, round ayah enters, leading Gandhi's sons—Harilal (ten), Manilal (six), and Ramdas (two)—into the room. All the boys are dressed in European suits, complete with ties and stiff collars. They approach Gandhi one by one, performing the pranam, a Hindu greeting, and then bend to touch his feet in traditional filial respect. Gandhi smiles warmly at them. Ramdas rushes to him, and Gandhi bends down to kiss him as the young boy wraps his arms around his neck. The boys, accustomed to household discipline, bow and exit the room in an orderly fashion. The ayah closes the door behind them, and their chatter can be heard fading down the hall. Gandhi stretches out on the bed and picks up another newspaper. Ba sits beside him, adjusting her position to attend to his bandage.",
    "167": "In a tense moment, a man and a woman lock eyes, their mutual anger palpable. As she attempts to stand, he seizes her arm, only for her to break free assertively. She speaks to him with derision, her words striking him deeply, though he remains conscious of another man's presence and struggles to control his temper. Defiantly, she settles back into her seat. They exchange resentful stares before he suddenly reaches for her arm again, yanking her to her feet with force. In a hushed yet violent confrontation, he drags her towards the rear door, opens it, and tries to push her out as she resists fiercely. Following this, he gazes at her breathlessly, his anger giving way to dazed remorse. He then sinks onto a stool, overwhelmed, cradling his head in his hands. Observing him, she sighs as her own anger and breath calm down. She moves to kneel before him, soothingly stroking the top of his head, embodying the nurturing role of a mother and wife. He looks up at her, his expression blank and filled with regret. A weak grin crosses his face, which she returns with a warmer, less conflicted smile. He sighs, embracing her as she leans into him, their heads touching in a moment of reconciliation. He holds her at arm's length to look at her directly, meeting her steady, warm gaze devoid of a smile.\n\nThe scene shifts to a theater bustling with an audience. The front rows are occupied by wealthy Muslim merchants, while small traders, peddlers, and artisans of various faiths including Muslim, Hindu, Parsee, and Sikh fill the back of the stalls. The gallery overflows with indentured laborers, predominantly Hindu, contributing to a restless and belligerent atmosphere. As the protagonist steps forward, he signals for silence with a raised hand. On the stage sit Khan, Singh, and three other leaders from the Indian community, with Charlie Andrews and Herman Kallenbach at the end of the row of chairs. From his viewpoint, the protagonist surveys the packed audience, his gaze landing on two conspicuous plainclothes European policemen seated at the end of the front row, accompanied by a uniformed officer. A buzz fills the air, erupting into loud, defiant applause. As it fades, the protagonist fixes his gaze on the policemen. The audience erupts into applause once more, but the policemen remain impassive, seemingly unaffected by the rhetoric. A rhythmic pounding from the gallery, signaling anger and protest, spreads throughout the hall. Amidst this, the police maintain an imperturbable stare. Khan leans towards Singh, acknowledging the protagonist's presence with a nod, and Singh responds with a smile at the subtlety of the gesture. The protagonist again raises his hand, quieting the hall. Suddenly, a large, powerful merchant in the third row stands up, indicating a violent response is imminent.",
    "170": "The film begins at a vibrant strip before transitioning to the bustling Mesas Casino. The scene then shifts to Epcot Center where the protagonist, Chili, stands alongside Fay. Inside an office, Chili sits across from Dick Allen, who is adorned in lots of jewelry with a giant neon cowgirl visible through the window behind him. Dick returns a snapshot to Chili, who then turns his attention to a minivan outside, staring at it intently. \n\nAmidst the rain, Chili gives the bus driver a stern look before exiting the vehicle. Left standing in the downpour, his seat gets wet as he has nowhere to go. The camera pans to a house where all the lights are off except for the blue glow of a television emanating from a downstairs room. Inside, a figure stirs and rolls over, revealing Harry Zimm, a balding, overweight movie producer. Harry sits up, grunts, and gets out of bed. A woman nearby looks at him as he peers out the window and begins searching the room for his clothes. \n\nA familiar voice catches Harry's attention, prompting him to listen at the door. He then crosses the entry hall of his nice home, drawn towards the flickering light of the television from another room. As Harry steps into the glow of a large Sony TV, the rest of the room remains shrouded in darkness. On the screen, Dave is interviewing actor Martin Weir until suddenly the screen goes black and the desk lamp illuminates the room, causing Harry to jump in surprise.\n\nChili emerges from the shadows, leaning into the light and speaking quietly and calmly. Harry, startled, presses a hand against his chest, then slides it down over his belly, taking his time to show he has regained composure. He stares back at Chili, trying to figure out who he is. Chili nods, almost smiles, as Harry slowly brings his hand down. Harry reaches for the phone, dialing '0', but Chili leans forward, hangs up the phone with his index finger, and casually reaches for the receiver. \n\nHarry sits down and starts to take another drink but pauses, looking at Chili, who shakes his head with a more thoughtful and curious expression. Chili nods again and leans forward on the desk. Their conversation escalates in volume as Karen descends the stairs. Chili and Harry are now seated at a butcher block table with a bottle of Dewars and glasses between them. \n\nAs Chili turns around, he spots Karen standing in the doorway, her arms folded across her chest and wearing a Lakers T-shirt that barely covers her crotch. The atmosphere becomes tense as Leo grows visibly uncomfortable. As Leo motions for another drink, a plane taxis past the window behind him, and his head drops to the table. A massive fireball erupts in the background.\n\nThe scene shifts to Fay, who reacts dramatically as an FFA guy points to a little green hat on one of the tables. She grabs the hat, clutches it to her chest, and pretends to faint.",
    "171": "As Karen reluctantly listens, a man escalates a deal from three hundred thousand to half a million dollars. Chili begins to speak, but Harry interrupts him. Harry then turns back to Chili, who notices Karen staring at him with a patient gaze. Karen shifts her attention to the two men sitting together as both Harry and Chili look at her. She meets Chili's gaze briefly before turning away and exiting the room, with Chili watching her departure. Harry nods thoughtfully before glancing at Chili again.\n\nThe camera pans up to show a young child engrossed with a walkman. Harry gestures toward the Cafe Med across the street, where a red Ferrari convertible is parked. Inside the cafe, Martin Weir and a woman with jet-black hair sit at a table, observed by Harry and Chili for a moment. As they continue their journey, Harry starts driving again.\n\nIn another scene, Chili peruses old photographs of Karen and a younger, blonde version of her with Harry. Amidst the clutter on the desk, Harry hands a movie script to Chili, who examines it curiously—it's his first time handling such a document. He flips it open to the middle and then tosses it back onto the desk, moving between a pair of plush red leather chairs. As Harry steps away from the window, he tugs on a string to lower the blinds behind the desk.\n\nThe sound of Ronnie singing fills the air just as the door opens, revealing Bo Catlett and Ronnie entering the office, guided by the Bear. Chili watches from behind the desk as they approach, with Catlett entering first. Ronnie takes a seat in one of the worn red leather chairs facing the desk, nonchalantly hooking one leg over the armrest and swinging it, clearly under the influence of some substance. Harry ushers them into their seats, but Chili, sitting down, ignores Harry's nod. Harry, seemingly forgetting his earlier instructions, leaves Chili in disbelief. Another man also fixates on Chili, who shakes his head, stunned at what he's hearing. Outside, men in a long black stretch limo nod at Chili, who returns the gesture while attempting to catch Harry's eye. Ronnie and Bo Catlett notice the exchange.\n\nTension mounts as Catlett locks eyes with Chili again, the situation intensifying between them. A man scrutinizes Chili, contemplating his next move, when Harry intervenes, reaching over the desk to pick up the script. Chili looks at Harry, pondering if there's a way to silence him without resorting to violence.",
    "173": "He pauses, gazing at her intently before resuming his walk. They halt at her car, and he remains there, observing as she drives off. A plane descends onto the runway as he stands before a row of lockers, fixated on one in particular. The camera moves in closer, and he starts towards it but then shifts his attention elsewhere.\n\nThe camera swiftly focuses downward to reveal a bulge near a woman's ankle, dressed casually in slacks and a blouse, tapping to an inaudible beat, with a similar bulge noticeable near a man's ankle. He ignites a cigarette, his gaze freezing as it drifts off-screen.\n\nYayo, drenched in sweat, leans against a railing and exchanges a confident, accomplished glance with the Bear. Bo Catlett, leaning on the same railing, looks down at Yayo once more. Bear's eyes meet his.\n\nChili indicates a star on a map. Both turn their attention to the entrance where a tall, slender woman with wild, jet-black hair stands. As Karen begins to respond, Nicki briskly ushers Chili inside, where he examines the photographs adorning the walls, predominantly featuring Martin. A vast backyard is visible in the distance, and this sight somehow eases Karen's tension. Chili follows her line of sight, and they watch as someone hugs her tightly, leaving Nicki and Chili awkwardly standing aside. Karen struggles to suppress a smile while Nicki nods gravely. Meanwhile, a gardener is busy clearing leaves.\n\nThe walls are lined with Martin's extensive photography collection, displayed in cracked oils. Martin, Karen, and Chili sit on white couches. Martin scrutinizes Karen and nods thoughtfully before withdrawing his hand, lost in contemplation. Karen looks nauseated, on the verge of giving up, yet Martin amuses himself with his own antics. Karen and Chili join in the laughter, with Karen leaning closer to Chili. Chili observes as the movie star adopts a hunched posture and narrows his shoulders, yet his gaze remains fixed on Martin.\n\nKaren shakes her head, her gaze briefly turning away as she fights a smile. She watches Martin, whose expression slowly shifts to a deadpan, sleepy look directed at Chili. Martin nods and gives Chili a chilling, emotionless stare. Chili shares a meaningful look with Karen, who relaxes back into her seat, clearly entertained by Chili's adept manipulation of Martin. Chili leans back, and Karen, increasingly amused by Chili's handling of the situation, looks from Martin to Chili and back to Martin, shaking her head once more. Martin's attention then shifts to Chili.\n\nFinally, Harry looks up to see Bo Catlett, impeccably dressed as always, standing alongside the Bear, who sports a Hawaiian shirt.",
    "175": "The movie opens with the Black Guy holding his open I.D. folder. As Ray Bones exits, another gate reveals two large men in sunglasses escorting a smaller, older individual. The smaller man glances back, offering a smile to someone behind him. Meanwhile, two agents exchange a glance, maintaining a neutral expression. Chili ascends from the stairwell, prompting the man to stand up straighter as Chili approaches. Chili sizes up the man, sensing either ignorance or an attempt at casual talk. The Bear, maintaining a silent gaze, watches Chili intently, his stare unbroken even as he nods, his eyes briefly closing and reopening.\n\nHarry, roused from sleep with his hair tousled, is startled as Ray Bones enters his office. Quickly sitting up, Harry nearly loses control of his bladder as Bones saunters in. Trying to regain composure using Chili's advice, Harry gestures towards the red leather chair across his desk. As Ray Bones takes a seat, Harry moves to the blinds and pulls them open, only to find no glare due to the setting sun. Ray comments on the beautiful red sunset, and Harry, feeling the situation deteriorating, forces a smile as he sits at his desk, anticipating further trouble.\n\nIn another scene, Bo Catlett is engaged in a phone call from behind his large wooden desk. The Bear appears slightly hunched over. As a car arrives in the garage, Bo Catlett glances towards the outer office. He ends his call and rises as three men, cloaked in dark sunglasses, emerge from the vehicle. It becomes clear that one of the men, an older Latino named Mr. Escobar, is flanked by two younger bodyguards. Escobar steps confidently into Bo's office. Simultaneously, the limo's back doors close, revealing Bo Catlett seated between the two unyielding bodyguards, facing Escobar across from him. Escobar scrutinizes Bo for a moment, causing Bo to tense up slightly before shrugging nonchalantly. Bo barely acknowledges the bodyguards, flashing a gleaming smile towards Escobar.\n\nElsewhere, Ronnie maneuvers erratically through traffic, casting challenging looks at other drivers. On his carphone, Bo Catlett continues his conversation. Back in Harry's office, Ray Bones leans forward, having heard similar remarks before. With a shake of his head, Bones stands, pulling black leather gloves from his pocket and circling the desk. Seizing Harry by the hair, Bones lifts him and hurls him across the room, crashing into a wall adorned with pictures, many of which dislodge and tumble onto Harry as Bones unleashes a brutal assault.",
    "178": "Laurie stands beside the telephone, lost in thought. With a casual shrug, she turns away from the window and strides back towards Tommy and Lindsey, who are seated comfortably on the couch.\n\nIn another room, the only source of light comes from a flickering candle that casts a gentle glow over the bed sheets, which rhythmically rise and fall, swaying side to side. Empty beer cans form a trail leading from the door to this bed, where the intimate moment between Bob and Lynda suddenly halts. Lynda, with her hair disheveled and a look of frustration on her face, is pushed down onto the bed by Bob. The camera slowly pulls back from their entwined figures on the bed, retreating through the bedroom doorway, revealing THE SHAPE standing ominously in the darkness, observing them silently. Eventually, Bob and Lynda reach their climax; Bob then rolls off her. Lynda, still in bed, lights a cigarette and passes it to Bob before lighting one for herself. After a moment, Bob gets up and leaves the room, leaving Lynda to smile contentedly to herself as she leans back against the pillows.\n\nBob makes his way through the swinging doors into the kitchen. He opens the refrigerator, grabs two beers, and then gathers some food and the beers into his arms. As he surveys the kitchen, he discovers a can of peanuts in another cupboard. Bob steps to the door to check outside; the yard is deserted except for the wind rustling the trees. He closes the doors, but then freezes as he stares at them. Curiosity getting the better of him, he walks to one of the doors, opens it, and turns away. He then approaches the other door and opens it as well. Right behind this door, THE SHAPE, donning a rubber mask, lunges forward, grabbing Bob firmly around the neck. Despite Bob's attempt to break free, THE SHAPE's grip is unyielding, causing Bob to cough and gag under the pressure. With a swift motion, THE SHAPE lifts Bob off the floor, his feet dangling helplessly. A guttural sound escapes Bob as THE SHAPE's hand tightens around his windpipe. Still holding Bob up with one hand, THE SHAPE forcefully slams him against the wall, suspending him several feet off the ground. Bob struggles in vain as THE SHAPE raises his other hand, revealing a butcher knife. With a powerful thrust, THE SHAPE drives the knife deep into Bob's chest, the blade penetrating through to the other side and embedding into the wall with a resounding thud. After this brutal act, THE SHAPE steps back, leaving Bob impaled on the wall, his eyes wide open in horror, lifeless.\n\nMeanwhile, Lynda remains in bed, nonchalantly smoking another cigarette. She hears someone entering the room but doesn't bother to look up, assuming it's Bob. However, it's THE SHAPE standing in the doorway. Mistaking him for a ghost due to his mask, Lynda looks at him and tries to engage, but receives no response. She playfully slides the sheets down from her body, laughing at her own jest, but her laughter quickly dies as she notices the figure's stillness. Turning around to look more closely, she sees THE SHAPE just standing there, unmoving and silent.",
    "179": "Lynda rises from her bed, her nude form bathed in the sensuous glow of candlelight. She moves gracefully to the phone. As she begins to dial, a ghostly figure appears in the doorway and advances toward her. The shape continues its approach as Lynda presses the phone to her ear.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurie sits on the couch, engaged in knitting. She rises to answer the ringing phone. As Lynda listens, the ghost reaches her from behind and seizes the phone, disrupting the call. The ghost then violently wraps the telephone cord around Lynda's neck. She struggles fiercely, squirming and writhing as the ghost tightens the cord, cutting off her air. In desperation, Lynda gasps and attempts to scream, pulling at the sheet that covers her assailant. The sheet slips away, revealing a grotesque Halloween mask beneath. The ghost pulls the cord even tighter, and Lynda, fighting for breath, slumps forward and becomes still.\n\nOn the other end of the line, Laurie hears the disturbing sounds of squeals and rustling, which continue to echo through the phone until it suddenly goes silent. Puzzled, Laurie hangs up and crosses to the window, peering out toward the Wallace house. The street outside is quiet, dark, and windy, with Bob's car parked in front. Laurie, concerned, returns to the phone and dials Annie's number. After a moment of consideration, she finally hangs up the phone and heads upstairs. There, she checks on Tommy and Lindsey, who are sound asleep on the bed. She watches them briefly before closing the door and leaving them to their rest.\n\nElsewhere, Loomis sits silently behind a hedge, keeping watch over the Myers house. After a moment of contemplation, he rises and starts walking down the quiet residential street. As he turns away, he notices the street is nearly empty, save for a distant station wagon. A sudden thought strikes him, prompting him to look again. Frustrated, he approaches the vehicle. As he walks, the station wagon becomes more visible, and he recognizes it, breaking into a run toward it. The camera focuses on the state emblem emblazoned on its side. Standing by his car, Loomis scans the empty street, deciding quickly to move forward almost running, his eyes darting back and forth, searching the rows of houses for any sign of something amiss.",
    "181": "Laurie stands frozen, horror etched on her face as she gazes upon her deceased friend. Gradually, our vision adjusts to the dimness, revealing the silhouette of a man standing ominously behind her. This shadowy figure becomes increasingly distinct, prompting Laurie to hastily retreat from the corner. Suddenly, the shape aggressively thrusts forward towards her, brandishing a knife and lunging multiple times with menacing intent. He brandishes a piece of fabric—her blouse—rips it violently, and then slashes her arm with the blade, causing her flesh to tear as she emits a piercing scream and whirls around in panic.\n\nStumbling backward, Laurie collides with a railing, desperately attempting to evade the blade's arc. In her frantic escape, she slips over the edge of the railing, and the camera captures her terrifying descent as it crashes to the floor. Accompanied by her screams, Laurie backs away, eventually hitting the ground, rolling over, and clutching her leg in pain. The assailant, masked and wielding a gleaming butcher knife, advances from the staircase towards her.\n\nGathering her strength, Laurie pulls herself off the floor and hobbles into the living room, with the shape swiftly pursuing her down the stairs. She makes her way to the kitchen, crawling inside and slamming the door shut behind her before swiftly locking it. Spotting a window over the sink, Laurie slowly rises and limps towards the back door. Her hand fumbles with the door handle, her desperation palpable as she repeatedly tries to open it, constantly looking over her shoulder.\n\nA loud pounding erupts on the door from the other side. Suddenly, the kitchen door explodes, its middle section shattering. The shape's hand reaches through, fumbling for the lock before successfully unlatching it. He forcefully pushes the door open and leaps into the kitchen. Meanwhile, Laurie manages to open the window halfway, then three-fourths, and drags herself out, landing roughly on the ground outside.\n\nPicking herself up, Laurie, limping heavily, sprints across the backyard as the camera follows her every move. Glancing back in fear, she trips over a fallen lamp and falls to the floor. Undeterred, she scrambles past the driveway and into a neighbor's backyard, making her way to their back door. With urgency, she pounds on the door repeatedly until the back porch light flickers on. Through the glass, an elderly woman in a nightgown approaches the door.",
    "182": "An elderly woman eyes a young girl warily before turning away from the door and leaving. The girl extends her hand and touches an object. Overwhelmed, Tommy bursts into tears and races upstairs. Laurie shifts from the doorway to the phone, lifts the receiver, dials, and waits in silence before gently placing the phone back down and standing motionless. With deliberate steps, Laurie circles around the couch and gradually kneels beside it. Her fingers graze the knitting needles jutting out of her tote bag, prompting her to extract one as a wave of fear washes over her, tears streaming silently down her face.\n\nAbruptly, a menacing figure known as The Shape vaults from behind the couch, lunging at Laurie with a butcher knife. The knife embeds itself into the couch with a heavy thud. Reacting swiftly, Laurie recoils, her arm rising instinctively. Grasping the knitting needle, she plunges it into The Shape's neck. He recoils, clawing desperately at the needle before collapsing in a lifeless heap on the floor. Laurie remains seated, her gaze fixed on the still figure.\n\nMeanwhile, Loomis navigates the street until blinding headlights and a screeching police car halt beside him. Suddenly, The Shape looms before him, butcher knife poised. Nearby, two children's screams pierce the air. Laurie hurriedly ushers them into the bathroom, slamming the door shut, locking it with a decisive click, and leaving herself exposed in the bedroom. She darts around the bed as The Shape advances relentlessly, his knife gleaming ominously.\n\nSeeking refuge, Laurie dashes into a closet, seals the sliding doors, and retreats to the back. The doors shudder under The Shape's relentless pounding and eventually give way as he forces his way in, pushing aside clothes. Inside, Laurie quickly grabs a wire hanger, unwinds its top, and straightens it out. As The Shape looms over her, knife raised, Laurie, in a desperate act of self-defense, thrusts the hanger into his right eye. He staggers back in agony, dropping the butcher knife. Seizing her chance, Laurie grabs the fallen weapon with both hands and drives it deep into The Shape's abdomen, the blade sinking to the hilt.",
    "177": "The camera's perspective shifts from a Jack-O-Lantern to peer through a window into a bedroom where an 18-year-old, very attractive sister enters. Dressed in a Halloween costume and mask, Alan, also 18, bursts into the room, causing the sister to giggle. Her boyfriend, who had been wearing the mask, grabs her and kisses her passionately after removing his disguise, revealing himself as a handsome young man. She responds enthusiastically, and they share another passionate kiss.\n\nAbruptly, the camera's viewpoint, now restless and agitated, pulls away from the window and starts pacing back and forth. It then swiftly moves down the side of the house, passing the Jack-O-Lantern, and approaches a door. The door opens, and the camera glides silently into the house, making its way to the kitchen and stopping at a drawer. The drawer opens, and a large butcher knife is taken out. The viewpoint then turns and heads toward the kitchen door, looking down a hallway to the front door.\n\nThe boyfriend emerges from the bedroom, buttoning his shirt. The camera slowly enters the room, focusing on a discarded Halloween mask on the floor, which it picks up. Suddenly, the mask covers the camera's view, and we see through the eye-holes as it moves slowly down the hall to the bedroom door, peering inside. Inside, the sister, still completely nude, sits at her night-table brushing her hair. Sensing a presence, she quickly spins around, staring at the camera while covering her breasts.\n\nWithout warning, the camera lunges forward. The sister stares incredulously as, in a rapid blur, the butcher knife is driven into her chest and withdrawn almost instantly. In a wild frenzy, the knife blurs in and out of the frame, mercilessly slashing at the sister. She screams and tries to fend off the blows with her hands before collapsing out of frame onto the floor.\n\nThe camera, now viewing the sister's lifeless body, backs away, spins around, and races out of the bedroom. It speeds through the darkened house, out the front door, down the steps, and up the street. The camera continues its frenzied flight along the sidewalk, up a side alley, and through someone's backyard until it abruptly stops in front of a mother and father just exiting a neighbor's house. The father reaches up and removes the Halloween mask, revealing Michael, a calm and quiet six-year-old boy with a bright smile.",
    "184": "In a classroom, the camera focuses on Laurie as a teacher lectures monotonously at the front. Laurie, barely attentive, doodles in her notebook. Her gaze drifts to a window where she dreamily watches the street outside, spotting a station wagon parked by the sidewalk with the shadowy figure of a man standing behind it. Quickly, she turns back to her notebook and resumes doodling, but her curiosity pulls her gaze back to the window. The station wagon and the mysterious figure are no longer there, so she returns her attention to her notebook.\n\nMeanwhile, at a closed gas station beside a highway, a car is parked. The camera slowly shifts focus to a nearby phone booth where Loomis is engaged in a telephone conversation. At the high school, Annie exits the side door and calls out to Laurie and Lynda, who pause to wait for her. Suddenly, Laurie stops and looks back toward the school, then down the street where the station wagon is slowly approaching them. The figure inside isn't visible behind the windshield, but as the vehicle passes, Laurie catches a fleeting glimpse of a strange, pale face staring back at her. The shape, now close to the camera and out of focus, locks eyes with Laurie before accelerating away. The wagon speeds past the girls, stops abruptly up the street, and lingers momentarily before speeding off and disappearing around a corner. The girls resume walking.\n\nThey eventually stop in front of Lynda's modest suburban home on a quiet, tree-lined street. Lynda walks up to her house, while Annie and Laurie continue down the street. Along the sidewalk, a series of bushes catches Laurie's attention. The camera closes in on her face as she stares ahead, spotting the shadowy figure of a man, barely visible and almost blending into the dark foliage. The figure vanishes, leaving just the bushes. Annie, frustrated, strides over and kicks the bushes hard, while Laurie stands several feet away on the sidewalk. Gradually, Laurie approaches the bushes and examines them closely.",
    "188": "In the living room, Annie listens to the growling of a dog. She then turns to Lindsey, who is also in the room. Outside, the legs of a mysterious shape are visible just a few feet from the house. Next to it, Lester's legs kick and struggle helplessly in mid-air. Off screen, the shape is seen strangling the dog, which hangs lifelessly moments later, its legs dangling without movement.\n\nMeanwhile, Laurie and Tommy are seated on a couch, engrossed in a Horror-thon playing loudly on the television. Laurie extends her hand to Tommy, and they rise together, walking hand in hand into the kitchen.\n\nAnnie, dressed in a nylon robe and carrying her clothes, moves through a passageway to the laundry room. As she walks, the wind causes her robe to flutter open. The door to the laundry room creaks open, and Annie steps into the dark space. Using the light from the main house, she spots the light switch but before she can reach it, a gust of wind slams the door shut. Standing still for a moment, she then resumes her search for the switch. She turns toward the slightly ajar door, behind which the silhouette of the shape is visible. As the wind pushes the door slightly more open, Annie glances outside before stepping back inside and heading to the washing machine. She lifts the lid and tosses her clothes in.\n\nSuddenly, a strong gust of wind bursts through the window above her, causing the door to slam shut again. Annie rushes to the door and struggles to open it, pulling with all her might.\n\nIn another part of the house, Lindsey Wallace, an 8-year-old with a pretty face, is absorbed in the Horror Marathon blaring from the TV. She remains seated in front of the screen, letting the phone ring unanswered beside her.\n\nBack in the laundry room, Annie looks up at the window above the washing machine, unaware that the shape is peering in from outside. In a flash, the shape disappears. Determined to escape, Annie hurries to the washing machine, climbs atop it, and tries to squeeze through the window. She gets stuck halfway through and, despite her efforts to squirm back inside, she remains trapped until Lindsey comes to her aid, pulling on her legs until Annie slides back onto the dryer.\n\nAs they return to the house, the phone rings again. From inside, Annie hears it and sees Lindsey dash across the room to answer it. After Lindsey sets the receiver down and leaves the kitchen, Annie, giving her a disapproving look, picks up the phone.\n\nSuddenly, the shape is seen walking through the hallway between the living room and the kitchen, right behind Annie as she proceeds into the living room.",
    "190": "Loomis cautiously approaches the front porch and reaches the door with hesitant steps. He casts a glance back towards his friends standing in the street. The young boy turns to unlock the door. His perspective shifts back to Lonnie, who stands frozen at the front door, gripped by sheer terror. Suddenly, Lonnie whirls around, his eyes wide with fear as he fixates on the animated hedge. In a flash, Lonnie dashes off the porch, sprinting back to his friends with the speed of the wind. The group of boys, overwhelmed by fright, dashes down the street.\n\nHidden behind the hedge, Loomis rises silently, a smirk playing on his lips as he watches the boys flee. Unexpectedly, two hands appear in the frame and seize Loomis by the shoulders, causing him to leap and spin around in shock. Facing him is Brackett, who then turns and walks away towards the street. A car soon arrives, parking in front of the house as its lights extinguish. The sound of laughter emanates from within the vehicle. Inside, the attractive 17-year-old Bob Simms pops open a can of beer, while beside him, Lynda eagerly gulps down her own. The interior lights of the car go out. Bob opens the car door, and the pair tumbles out onto the ground. The beer can tips over, spilling onto the front seat as they embrace. Bob playfully grabs Lynda, eliciting giggles from her. He then lifts her into his arms and carries her towards the front door, where Lynda squirms playfully. As he sets her down, her foot inadvertently strikes the door, causing it to swing open. Both Bob and Lynda pause, then enter the house, finding the living room empty and dark.\n\nInside, they start flicking on the lights. Bob approaches Lynda, and they embrace once more, sharing a kiss. He guides her to the couch, turning off the light as they settle in. Unbeknownst to them, a shadow looms over them, and a man's silhouette on the stairway watches their every move. The house plunges into complete darkness, only to be pierced by an orange light drifting through the room. As it nears, it's revealed that Laurie is holding a Jack-O-Lantern, its candle casting a glow from within the pumpkin. Behind her, Lindsey and Tommy mimic spooky sounds as they all proceed through the house to the front window. Laurie positions the Jack-O-Lantern on the window sill and peers down the street, spotting Bob's car parked in front of the Wallaces' house. She then takes a seat on the couch, sighing, with Lindsey and Tommy snuggling up beside her.\n\nThe phone rings, prompting Laurie to rise and answer it. Meanwhile, Lynda, after hanging up the phone, flashes a grin at Bob, who mirrors her expression. Lynda seizes Bob's hand, pulling him up from the couch, and they briskly ascend the stairs. At the top, Lynda moves to the window and looks out.",
    "195": "In a dimly lit room, Potter lights a large cigar he has just handed to George. A goon, as usual, stands impassively next to Potter's chair. Suddenly, George drops his cigar onto his lap and frantically brushes away the sparks from his clothes. As they shake hands, George is overcome with a physical revulsion; Potter's hand feels like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of contact, George realizes he could never associate with this man. Shuddering, he drops Potter's hand and peers intently into his face. Turning away, George shouts at the goon, who remains emotionless beside Potter's wheelchair. As he exits, George yells at Mr. Potter's secretary in the outer office, which is modestly furnished with only a cheap bed, a couple of chairs, and a dresser.\n\nInside, Mary lies asleep on the bed. George enters, his mind swirling with thoughts from his past life. He removes his hat and coat, then moves to the dresser and gazes at his reflection in the mirror. His attention shifts to a picture on the nearby wall—a sketch of George lassoing the moon, first seen in Mary's living room. Mary wakes up and begins to sing their theme song. George crosses to the bed and sits on its edge, and Mary nods her head happily. Meanwhile, the voices of Joseph and Clarence in Heaven are heard over a series of shots.\n\nGeorge crosses the street toward the Building and Loan offices. In another scene, Mary sits on the floor playing with a baby, while a little boy occupies a nearby playpen. Mary is also busy hanging wallpaper and painting their old home. George, appearing tired and discouraged, enters the hall and begins to climb the stairs, only to have the banister knob come off in his hand.\n\nThe scene shifts to a group of newly drafted men marching in a camp, and Mrs. Bailey and other women in Red Cross uniforms diligently sewing. Mary serves coffee and doughnuts from a portable U.S.O. pushcart to men leaning out of a train. Sam Wainwright displays blueprints to two Army officers. Potter is wheeled to a long table surrounded by several men. Gower and Uncle Billy lead a bond rally from atop an Army tank. Bert, in uniform, cautiously advances with a fixed bayonet, with smoke and gunfire flashing in the background. Overhead, hundreds of planes fly, dropping parachutes. In the foreground, Marty beckons soldiers to follow him. Harry fastens the helmet of his flying clothes, preparing for action.",
    "201": "In the film, Clarence, an angel whose voice we've heard from Heaven, is introduced standing in water. Nearby, George sits before a wood-burning stove, his clothes drying on a line. He wears long winter underwear and sips hot coffee, his gaze fixed on the stove. Cold, gloomy, and slightly drunk, George ignores both Clarence and the tollkeeper, consumed by thoughts of his near suicide and his unresolved issues.\n\nClarence, on the other side of the stove, dons an undershirt—a ludicrous seventeenth-century garment resembling a baby's nightshirt with embroidered cuffs and collar, gathered at the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees, astonishing the tollkeeper, who sits against the wall, eyeing them suspiciously. Clarence, aware of the tollkeeper's amazement, shakes a book, prompting incredulous stares.\n\nGeorge, surprised, looks up, repeatedly attempting to spit but each time stopped by Clarence's amazing actions or words. The tollkeeper, also about to spit, is halted mid-action by Clarence's next statement. Both George and the tollkeeper react, with George casually observing the strange, smiling little man a second time. The tollkeeper grows increasingly nervous as George, leaning against the wall on his chair tipped back on two legs, brings his hand to his mouth.\n\nSuddenly, the tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash. Rising warily, he exits, his expression suggesting he's about to call the police. George, trying to clear his mind, rubs his head with his hand and looks up at Clarence standing beside him. Clarence, struggling to connect with George, paces thoughtfully across the room.\n\nAs Clarence speaks, the snow stops falling outside, and a strong wind blows open the door to the shack. Clarence rushes to close it. Meanwhile, George, more interested in his hearing than in Clarence's words, cocks his head, favoring his deaf ear, and feels it as Clarence continues talking. George then indicates his bad ear and feels his lip, surprised to find no sign of the recent cut from Welch, now thoroughly confused.\n\nGeorge touches the clothes on the line, and both start dressing. Suddenly, George interrupts himself as they find themselves on an empty street—the same one where George's car had swerved into a tree near the sidewalk. Arriving at the spot, they find no car and an undamaged tree, deepening George's bewilderment.",
    "203": "The homeowner, carrying Christmas packages under his arm, walks past. He bends down to inspect the trunk of a tree, then stands up to sniff George's breath before recoiling and continuing toward his house. George stands utterly perplexed. He then wraps his arm around Clarence, and they begin walking up the road.\n\nThey arrive at Martini's place, which is barely recognizable. The once cheerful Italian atmosphere has vanished, replaced by a rough, hard-drinking honky-tonk bar. The tables are bare, and the patrons appear tougher and more downcast. George and Clarence enter, approaching the bar, causing two patrons to leave as they draw near. Nick, the bartender, is behind the bar. As they order, Nick leans forward, thrusting his left fist menacingly close to Clarence's eye, leaving Clarence puzzled by this aggressive behavior. Nick then turns to prepare their drinks, but pauses suspiciously as he listens to their conversation, halting mid-pour with the bottle still in hand. George glances up at Nick, who then slams the bottle down onto the counter forcefully.\n\nIn the bar, a small, frail man with watery eyes and a broken-down appearance, holding his hat, enters. It's Gower, the druggist, who seems stunned by what he sees. Nick grabs a seltzer bottle and sprays Gower in the face, prompting harsh laughter from the crowd. Gower manages a weak smile as the soda drips from his face. Horrified, George jumps up and rushes to Gower's side, but the bouncers quickly eject Gower from the front door. George then returns to the bar.\n\nSuddenly, George and Clarence are thrown through the door, landing in the snow outside. Inside, Nick is seen at the cash register, ringing the bell briskly. George and Clarence lie in the snow; George wears a strange, puzzled expression. They stay as they fell for a moment, exchanging looks. George catches sight of the neon sign above the door of the building. They rise to their feet, and George points to the sign, looking at Clarence, who hangs his head in a resigned manner. George, intensely curious, approaches Clarence, pokes his arm, confirming it's flesh. Frantically, George searches his pockets for some form of identification but finds none, leaving him completely baffled. He continues to turn his pockets inside out feverishly before setting off. Clarence rises and slowly follows him, occasionally glancing upward toward Heaven.\n\nAs George walks, the camera follows him, revealing the drastic transformation of the town. What was once a quiet, orderly small town has now taken on the rough character of a frontier village. George, in surprise, heads toward the main part of town.",
    "211": "Under the glow of a full moon filtering through the trees, George abruptly rises from his chair, concluding his conversation. As another man exits the porch, heading into his house, he forcefully shuts the door behind him. Meanwhile, Mary dashes out of view, but as she does, George inadvertently stands on the belt of her bathrobe, causing it to slip off her as she moves. He then drops his bundle of clothes to retrieve her robe, scanning the surroundings in vain for Mary. From behind the foliage, Mary's face emerges, watching cautiously. George approaches the bush with the robe in hand, poised to toss it to her when a sudden thought halts him. Mary stirs restlessly within the bushes as headlights suddenly sweep the scene, revealing the old Bailey automobile rolling in with Harry driving and Uncle Billy by his side. George quickly drapes the robe over the bush and joins them in the car. As they drive away, Mary, now draped in the robe, emerges from the bush and watches the departing vehicle.\n\nIn a boardroom, around a long table sit about twelve directors, key figures of Bedford Falls including Dr. Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance agent, a real estate salesman, and others. Among them are George and Uncle Billy, with Dr. Campbell presiding as Chairman. Each director is provided with individual reports to review, surrounded by folders and papers from their discussions. Notably present is Henry F. Potter, seated prominently with his goon at his side in a wheelchair. Dr. Campbell stands, prompting George and Uncle Billy to gather their documents and prepare to exit. The room watches in astonishment as they move towards the door. At the threshold, George, coat and papers in hand, is poised to leave but pauses, provoked by Potter's remarks about his father. George returns to the table, heated, before storming out with the jubilant Uncle Billy in tow. Potter's expression hardens with animosity as the directors erupt into a noisy debate.\n\nGeorge, clearly agitated, fumbles with his bag and papers, with the ever-talkative Uncle Billy shadowing him, concerned about the potential dissolution of the Building and Loan which could disrupt his plans. The tension breaks when Ernie appears in the doorway, followed by an excited Dr. Campbell rushing out. Cheers erupt from Cousin Eustace, Cousin Tilly, and Uncle Billy. In a moment of relief, Dr. Campbell and George share a handshake.\n\nThe night sky, adorned with the same twinkling stars seen at the film's opening, now serves as a backdrop to voices from Heaven. At a bustling train station, typical activity unfolds as people await their trains. Uncle Billy, perched on a baggage wagon and snacking on peanuts, observes as George paces anxiously back and forth before him.",
    "216": "At the foot of the cross, Everett decisively cuts the last guy wire with his pincers, eliciting a sharp BOINK, prompting him and three others to dash away swiftly. As the crowd disperses in a panic, the cross hurtles down towards Big Dan, who remains motionless, his gaze fixed upward. The cross then smashes into Big Dan Teague, erupting into a spectacular cascade of sparks and embers that completely engulfs him.\n\nA vehicle rolls to a stop in front of a town hall, from which the sounds of a party spill out. Pappy O'Daniel steps out, accompanied by his entourage—Eckard, Spivey, and Junior. Amidst this, Delmar appears sullen, and Everett looks utterly shocked. As car headlights sweep by, the men quickly retreat into an alleyway. The car proceeds to the banquet hall, from which Homer Stokes and his midget companion emerge. The midget discards a crumpled white hood into the car and both don their suitcoats, then briskly ascend the stairs, the midget struggling to match Stokes's pace.\n\nMeanwhile, Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy slip in through the back door. Their blackface makeup has been removed, but they are now disguised with hastily applied, long gray beards using spirit gum. Each man clutches a case containing a musical instrument as they push their way through the bustling kitchen staff.\n\nIn the banquet hall, Penny and Waldrip sit prominently at the head table, surrounded by the Wharvey gals. Facing the audience with their backs to the stage, they are unaware as Everett, Pete, Delmar, and Tommy, now disguised as a bearded band, take their positions. Pappy O'Daniel stands close to Waldrip, whispering confidentially into his ear with an arm draped over his shoulder. Waldrip listens, sitting rigidly, his frown fixed on some distant point.\n\nSuddenly, Waldrip bursts out, while Penny shakes her head vehemently and looks down at her plate, seemingly unaffected by Everett’s ongoing pleas directed at her back. The band strikes up 'Man of Constant Sorrow,' triggering an immense reaction from the crowd. Everett, still attempting to catch Penny's eye, is taken aback by the thunderous applause. Exchanging puzzled glances, Everett and his bandmates dive deeper into their performance with renewed vigor. Everett then breaks into an impromptu buck-and-wing dance, escalating the crowd's excitement to feverish levels.\n\nHomer Stokes, observing the band, wears a scowl. The audience, in turn, watches him with stony expressions. Undeterred, Stokes continues his speech, but a tomato soon strikes him, followed by a barrage of food. Attempting to shield himself, he roars into the microphone.\n\nElsewhere, an old couple, hunched over a crystal set, listens intently to the tinny broadcast. They exchange silent glances, then refocus on the device. Back at the event, the band's music nearly drowns out Stokes's words, while his midget companion watches with growing concern. The situation escalates when an audience member pulls out the microphone plug, leaving Stokes to mouth words that no one can hear.",
    "219": "The four men sit around, attentively listening to the sounds emanating from a large box radio. Wash resumes whittling, Everett meticulously applies pomade from a jar to his hair using a comb, Pete picks at his teeth with a toothpick, and Delmar rhythmically waves a hand, lost in the music. Clearing his throat, Everett then carefully screws the lid back onto the pomade jar.\n\nLater, they find themselves sleeping in a hayloft, where Everett sports a hairnet to protect his carefully styled hair. Suddenly, a spotlight sweeps across the hayloft ceiling and a loud voice booms out. Startled awake, the men sit up. From an aerial view, a lawman, bullhorn in hand and surrounded by armed deputies, appears foreshortened. Beside him stands a sheriff, his tin star glinting, watching through mirrored sunglasses with a drooling bloodhound at his side.\n\nPete shouts down from the hayport. Amidst the sudden sound of gunfire, Everett yanks Pete down as bullets from a tommy gun rip through the hayloft. Infuriated, Pete seizes a flaming faggot and throws it down at the group of deputies below, where it lands harmlessly amidst scattered straw. A drum begins to spin, flames start to crawl up the outside of a van, and bullet holes riddle its body. Men scatter as the vehicle shakes under the barrage of multiple tommy guns. Tires burst and hiss, doors fly open, and glass shatters. Pete, Everett, and Delmar jump into the van, slamming the doors shut. A boy, his feet extended by strapped-on wood blocks to reach the pedals and sitting on a Sears Roebuck catalogue for visibility, shifts into gear. The car accelerates toward a flaming wall and crashes through it.\n\nThe Hogwallop boy walks unsteadily down the middle of a deserted road, still wearing the wood blocks. Turning to face the camera, he lets out a shout. In the foreground, Pete enters and tosses a dirt clod at the boy, missing his target and yelling. The camera then pans to show Pete walking over to the shoulder where their car sits, hood up, with Everett and Delmar examining the engine.\n\nIn a small gesture, Everett slides a tin across a counter, leaving him momentarily stunned before he picks it up. On a wooded hillside, the men gather around a twig fire, roasting a small animal on a spit. A figure stalks into the scene and drops down by the fire in disgust, shaking his head with grim resignation. Everett scrapes the remaining pomade onto his comb and begins to groom his hair. Reaching into his pocket, Everett pulls out a gold watch and tosses it to Pete, who looks at it with puzzlement before opening it to read the inscription inside.",
    "221": "As Pappy brushes past them, Junior attempts to coax him, only to receive a swift slap from Pappy's hat. Pappy then dramatically waves his hat at the radio building where singers, clad in faux hillbilly outfits and carrying various musical instrument cases, emerge from a second car. In the background, Tommy plays and sings a soulful slow blues.\n\nMeanwhile, three convicts sit by a fire, holding coffee cups and gazing into the flames. One of them, Pete, thoughtfully swishes his coffee while murmuring softly. Suddenly, the three men tense up as Pete begins to shovel dirt onto the fire. Delmar and Everett scramble to peek over a nearby low ridge. From their vantage point, they spot a lone barn with their car parked beside it. Various police vehicles are positioned facing the barn, their armed occupants taking cover behind the cars and aiming their guns at the structure. A man with a bullhorn continues to direct his comments towards the distant barn. The convicts notice the sheriff standing impassively next to the man with the bullhorn, holding a leash to which a straining bloodhound is attached.\n\nThe three men then shuffle down a dusty road, their attention broken by the sound of a speeding car approaching. The car comes into view, cornering sharply on two wheels before crashing back onto all four. As it speeds along, dollar bills flutter and snap out of its windows. The car roars up to the three men, and Delmar optimistically sticks out his thumb. The vehicle screeches to a halt, revealing a young driver in a sharp suit with a round, babylike face, who leans over to call through the passenger window.\n\nDelmar plucks a fluttering dollar bill from the air, examining it with wonder. He stretches the bill between his hands, brings the sides together, and gives it an appraising pop. Enchanted by the wafting currency, Delmar looks around and yanks another bill out of the air, reminiscent of a child captivated by soap bubbles.\n\nThe three men quickly climb into the car, which then squeals away. The driver glances up at the rearview mirror as the sound of sirens grows louder. He reaches inside his coat but stops short of drawing a gun, instead appraising his new passengers. Delmar, reacting to the paper currency fluttering inside the car, opens his door and steps onto the running board, giving Everett a casual nudge. Startled, Everett slides over.\n\nOutside, George Nelson, now fully out of the car and facing the pursuit vehicles, has one hand clamped on the car roof while waving to Delmar with the other. Nelson then sends a spray of bullets back at the pursuing cars, firing wildly as they gain on him, returning fire.",
    "223": "In a rain-soaked scene, Everett, Pete, and Delmar seek refuge under the dripping eave of a barn, their coats clutched tightly at the neck as they gaze despondently at the downpour. They soon trek along a red dirt road that winds through a bayou before settling around a campfire. There, Everett captivates Pete and Delmar with an animated ghost story, his audience wide-eyed and enthralled from their lower seats.\n\nContinuing their journey, the trio passes a cotton field, the landscape peppered with burst pods. Amidst this, a sad-faced woman in a calico dress, visibly crestfallen, speaks to a clerk.\n\nThe narrative shifts as Pete eagerly exits a car before it fully stops, stumbling down a bank toward a river. Everett and Delmar follow at a more leisurely pace, with Everett chuckling lightly. The scene is filled with unearthly singing, emanating full volume from three beautiful yet otherworldly women who are washing clothes in the stream, rhythmically dunking and beating them against rocks. Pete, visibly smitten, awkwardly smiles with deep, intense eyes. Despite his attempts to engage them, the laundresses do not respond verbally, though they smile at him as they keep singing. Pete persists, even reaching into their laundry basket, maintaining his gaze on the women and hissing whispers out of the corner of his mouth, while Everett laughs softly. One of the women, still singing, offers Everett a jug marked with three Xes, but none of them verbally respond.\n\nThe scene takes a surreal turn as Delmar, horrified, notices rhythmic movement in a pile of clothes—a spot on a shirt rising and falling. Everett joins him to investigate, and they watch as the movement migrates up the shirt until a large yellow toad emerges from under the collar. Delmar keens in response, and Everett appears bewildered. The toad then hops down the river bank, ending up in Delmar's lap as he whimpers while petting it. The frog croaks, and Delmar's whimpering continues, with Everett squinting and shaking his head in confusion.\n\nIn a more formal setting, a table is set with linen, where Delmar and Everett sit deep in conversation, a shoebox between them. Everett points a knife at the shoebox, adding intensity to their discussion.\n\nThe perspective shifts to a broad-shouldered man in a cream-colored suit and a shirt with a powder-blue collar, who is deeply engrossed in a large plate of steak and eggs. Sensing something, he looks up, cocks his head, and slowly turns, revealing a cream-colored eyepatch with powder-blue trim. His good eye fixes intently on Everett and Delmar, who are still arguing out of earshot, just as a waitress arrives to take their order.",
    "225": "He enters the car, which then sputters and chugs away down the road. Delmar, struggling to stand, makes his way over to the dead frog, tears streaming down his face. His arms, stretched high and bound to a tree limb, are in full view. His interrogator brandishes a bullwhip. Another strike, another cry of pain. A third man steps into the torchlight, followed by a drooling hound. This man is Cooley, the sheriff we recognize from earlier barn confrontations, wearing his signature mirrored sunglasses. The two men step back from Pete in acknowledgment. The soft patter of rain begins to quicken its pace. Cooley glances up, then down at Pete, shrugs, and looks away. Gazing upward into the darkness, a rope is thrown up, disappearing into the night before dropping back down, a noose swinging at its end. The two henchmen slip the noose over Pete's neck. Delmar, stubbornly, shakes his head.\n\nFrom a distance, the sound of picks striking and men chanting reaches them. Everett, with hollow eyes, tries to reassure both Delmar and himself, though his voice fades as he watches the road. They pass a group of chained men in prison stripes and duck-billed caps, wielding pickaxes and shovels by the roadside. As Everett attempts to continue his thought, he stares at the line of men, who appear ghostly in the haze of heat and dust. Everett is visibly haunted. The last man in the line swings his pick, then looks up as he grows smaller in the distance. Everett, staring back at him, receives a slack-jawed gaze until the man is obscured by heat waves and the truck's dusty trail. Blinking, Everett shakes his head as if to clear it, and the truck continues rattling on.\n\nOn a stage adorned with bunting, a man with round rimless glasses and a slender neck speaks to a crowd of rural folk. Identified on posters as 'Homer Stokes, Friend of the Little Man,' he energetically shakes a broom overhead. A midget in overalls stands beside him, waving a small broom in sync with Stokes' gestures. Amidst the cheers, he smiles broadly as three girls in gingham dresses rush to join him on stage; the eldest is around ten years old. Everett forcefully makes his way through the crowd toward the stage, with a puzzled Delmar following closely. A man wearing a straw boater hat joins them. Everett sniffs the air, squints, and then takes a wild swing at Waldrip, who nimbly dodges it. Adopting a Marquess of Queensbury stance, Waldrip dances around, landing sharp punches on Everett's nose, leaving him stunned and outmatched. Eventually, Everett is thrown out of the establishment, its glass doors swinging open, and he lands face-first in the street dust.",
    "226": "As romantic tunes play softly through a tinny speaker, Everett slumps in his seat, his irritation evident as he hisses angrily, watching alongside Delmar in the dimly lit and quiet theater. The sparse audience, including Everett and Delmar, shifts restlessly in their seats. Suddenly, a man armed with a shotgun strides into the auditorium, halting several rows behind them after walking halfway down the aisle. He surveys the room before raising a whistle to his lips. At the sound of his whistle, the back doors burst open, and a line of chained men marches in briskly, filling one row and then the next with a cacophony of clanking chains. They stand silently until the first guard, accompanied by two others, scans the theater and blows his whistle once more, prompting the men to sit. Another whistle cues the film to resume its speed.\n\nFrom behind, a hissing whisper catches Everett and Delmar's attention. Everett's jaw drops, his expression frozen in a mix of horror and disbelief, as if he's seen a ghost. Delmar, initially mirroring Everett's shock, gradually accepts the reality of Pete's presence among the convicts. Pete, squinting and tilting his head in confusion, struggles to understand Delmar's slow, exaggeratedly mouthed whisper. Despite Pete's overarticulated response indicating he still didn't catch it, the scene shifts to Pappy O'Daniel on the veranda of the Governor's Mansion. As the sun sets, Pappy sips bourbon and smokes a cigar, his mood turning quizzical upon hearing a whisper. He looks back and forth between the whisperers, his expression one of mild boredom, his cigar drooping in his mouth forming an 'O'.\n\nLater, Everett emerges over the edge of his bed, his face blackened and his stance unsteady as if on a boat. He wields a large, long-armed, short-nosed pincering tool, using it to lock onto Pete's chain and lever it free with a chinking sound. Despite his newly gained freedom, Pete's eyes burn into Everett's, his head shaking in misery before he breaks down in tears. He embraces a stunned Delmar and then an uncomfortable Everett. The scene shifts abruptly as Pete, now stunned himself, and Delmar turn their attention to Everett. Delmar's mood lifts momentarily.\n\nTension escalates when Pete lunges at Everett, tackling him to the ground and wrapping his hands around Everett's throat. As they roll through some brush, they find themselves halfway into a clearing where they suddenly stop. Their gaze falls upon a great open field where men in bedsheets march in formation before a massive, fiery cross. Realizing the danger, Pete and Everett quickly crabwalk back into the bushes, soon joined by Delmar as they push their way through to safety.",
    "229": "Szpilman meticulously logs the tools each worker borrows at the construction site. A worker briefly peeks into the storage area. Jewish workers begin to gather on the site in disorganized lines as an SS Captain confidently strides in. With a jovial demeanor and an array of jokes, the SS Captain leaps onto the scaffolding, standing tall and beaming as he surveys the workers. A quick, meaningful look passes between Szpilman and Majorek. The SS Captain's broad smile fills the air, yet the workers remain unresponsive. He rubs his thumb and forefinger together, leering at them, but still no reaction; his smile fades away. Snow starts to fall.\n\nMajorek pulls a barrow across the site, guided by a rope attached to its shaft. The barrow carries five sacks. He maneuvers it over to where Szpilman is waiting. Majorek, previously asleep, snaps awake. He accepts a piece of paper from Szpilman but keeps silent. Turning over, Majorek drifts back to sleep. Szpilman heads back to his bunk. He has unloaded the potato sacks into a corner and is kneeling, preparing to untie the string on the smallest sack when a sound catches his attention. He glances around.\n\nAn SS Lieutenant enters the storage room, sucking his bleeding finger. Szpilman swiftly moves to a cupboard, retrieves a First Aid tin, and hands a plaster to the SS Lieutenant. He gestures towards the sacks with a nod. Trembling with fear, Szpilman struggles to untie the string and fails. The SS Lieutenant forcefully pushes him aside, draws a dagger from his belt, and slices the string open. He reaches into the sack, pulling out a handful of long yellow beans, then oatmeal, which he flings into Szpilman's face. With a vicious kick, he sends Szpilman reeling and storms off. Gasping for air, Szpilman reaches into the bottom of the sack, uncovering a pistol and ammunition, which he quickly conceals under his clothing. The air turns bitingly cold.\n\nThe Jewish workers, clutching bundles of potatoes and bread, trudge back towards the ghetto gates under the watch of two Polish policemen. One of the policemen takes a swig of vodka and locks eyes with Szpilman. With a glassy stare, he confronts Szpilman, who is petrified and desperately tries to shield his concealed package. In a tense moment, Zick-Zack seizes Szpilman by the coat. Both policemen find this amusing, recovering from their laughter as the column resumes its march. A brief silence is broken by a lone voice singing from the back, \"Children of Warsaw will go to fight!\" Szpilman turns to see Majorek leading the song. A smile crosses Szpilman's face, and Majorek acknowledges it with a nod. Szpilman joins the song, and soon the others follow, their voices growing stronger as they march on, singing with vigor. Later, Szpilman lies in a steaming bath, his eyes closed, seemingly in a trance.",
    "231": "In the quiet apartment, Gebczynski approaches from behind and closes the cupboard. He then heads towards the front door but pauses. Handing over a scrap of paper, he shakes Szpilman's hand and departs hastily. Left alone, Szpilman stands momentarily disoriented before removing his shoe and tucking the piece of paper inside it. As he does this, his gaze falls upon the divan bed. He approaches it, removes his other shoe, and lies down, testing the bed's springiness with his body. A beatific smile graces his face before he closes his eyes and drifts into immediate sleep.\n\nThe sound of voices rouses Szpilman from his slumber. He opens his eyes, momentarily uncertain of his surroundings, and hears the voices again from the neighboring apartment. Intrigued, he gets up, moves closer to the wall, presses his ear against it, and listens intently. Szpilman finds himself enjoying the moment until the sound of a piano fills the air, played with deep emotion yet filled with errors. The piano music abruptly halts, followed by the sound of a door slamming.\n\nA woman hands Szpilman a parcel. He takes it to the small kitchen and unpacks it while Janina looks out the window. She turns her gaze back outside. Outside, the building is engulfed in flames, with corpses scattered across the pavement. German soldiers stand around, chatting and laughing. A group of Jewish fighters is lined up and executed. The sun blazes down on the now burned-out shells of the ghetto buildings, the street desolate. Autumn leaves fall and swirl in the wind.\n\nSzpilman gazes out the window as snow falls, and ice forms on the windows. The sound of a key turning in the door catches his attention. He turns as the door opens and Gebczynski enters, visibly distraught. Gebczynski quickly lights a cigarette while speaking in hushed, rapid tones before leaving. Szpilman listens to Gebczynski's footsteps fading down the stairs. He notices the cigarette stub, picks it up, lights it, and smokes awkwardly, coughing as he does so.\n\nThe screech of brakes and a car engine alert Szpilman. He tenses up as German voices shout and heavy footsteps ascend the stairs. Szpilman moves to the window, opens it, and places a chair sideways in front of it to use as a step, contemplating the best way to jump. He then leans against the wall near the door, waiting. The sounds of slamming doors, German shouts, and a scream fill the air. Szpilman prepares himself to leap from the window. The footsteps on the stairs begin to descend, and another door slams. Cautiously, Szpilman approaches the window and looks out to see SS men escorting two prisoners and shoving them into a car, which then speeds away, leaving the street empty.\n\nSnow continues to fall, accompanied by howling wind. Szpilman lies on the divan, cold, unshaven, his hair long and dirty. Despite his condition, he manages to rise.",
    "227": "In a bustling crowd, a man turns to find a strikingly beautiful young woman gazing at him with adoration, both caught in the surge of jostling people. His eyes brighten in response. Suddenly, JUREK wedges himself between them, seizing the woman's arm, and forcefully navigates his way down the stairs, dragging her with him. The man, caught in the tide of the crowd, is swept into the lobby where debris is scattered everywhere. Amidst this chaos, Szpilman struggles towards the main door, but another bomb detonates, sending a cloud of dust and debris into the air, momentarily obscuring everyone.\n\nIn a state of panic, the Szpilman family rushes through their tastefully decorated bourgeois apartment. They move frantically between rooms, hurriedly packing clothes and belongings into open suitcases and a trunk. The living room, lined with books and paintings, features a boudoir grand piano, silver platters, and candlesticks. Amidst the chaos, one family member sits by the radio, ear pressed to the speaker, trying to find a clear station. The father, clutching a silver-framed photograph, approaches the mother. He then retreats to his room. Overwhelmed, the mother barely holds back tears before rushing into the kitchen just as Szpilman enters the apartment, bewildered by the flurry of activity. She dashes out of the kitchen and begins to search. Meanwhile, the others continue their hurried packing. They gather around as one family member strikes the radio in frustration. The father pours liqueur into glasses. Seated at the dining table, the family has just finished their meal, the table laden with the remnants of their dinner. They clink their glasses and drink together.\n\nThe scene shifts to a street where buildings lay in ruins, smoke still rising. Onlookers, including Szpilman, Henryk, and their father who strains to see, stand on the sidewalk. They watch expressionlessly as a column of German soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, marches into view.\n\nBack in the apartment, Regina opens and closes a window, carefully examining the frame with her fingers. At the other end, the father counts a dwindling stack of notes and coins. Henryk is lost in thought while Szpilman fiddles with his father's violin. The apartment now has less furniture, and the silver is gone. All eyes turn to the dining table, now marred with stains and its veneer peeling away at one corner. As they watch, the veneer snaps, revealing the bare wood beneath. Quickly, they begin to hide their possessions.\n\nSzpilman stands at a public telephone, waiting anxiously for his call to be answered. Later, he and Dorota walk along a tree-lined street amidst bombed-out buildings and rubble. Dorota steals admiring, almost loving glances at Szpilman as they converse and stroll. He responds with a smile, visibly touched by her affection, while she becomes embarrassed and starts to laugh. Their laughter grows until they are clinging to each other, almost helpless. Amidst their joyous moment, Szpilman tenderly takes Dorota's hand and kisses it.\n\nThe family reconvenes around the dining table, where the father reads aloud from the newspaper, keeping everyone informed and united in the face of uncertainty.",
    "237": "The film opens with a scene of a man joyfully dashing to join his family, a smile lighting up his face. As he briefly looks back, Dorota vanishes from view, yet the procession they are part of moves forward relentlessly. Upon arriving at their new home, the Szpilman family begins to unpack their possessions in a quiet and reflective manner. The father momentarily pauses, assessing their new environment, before they all move to the window to observe the street below. They see men constructing a wall that cuts across the street, amidst the slush and flurry of activity. The street is alive with vendors selling an array of goods—shoes, clothing, carpets, curtains, and food. Amidst this, a woman is seen offering cakes beneath a makeshift cover of barbed wire, contributing to the noisy and bustling atmosphere.\n\nNavigating through the throng of traders, Henryk, now slightly more worn in appearance, stands with a basket at his feet filled with books. He is actively trying to engage passersby with a couple of volumes he holds. Szpilman, also showing signs of wear, maneuvers through the crowd of sellers, buyers, beggars, and pedestrians to reach Henryk. Together, they place the books back into the basket and lift it by its handles, setting off on their journey. As they carry the basket, they pass by beggars and children seeking food. Suddenly, their path is blocked by a woman adorned in bright rouge, heavy eyebrows, and an old green velvet curtain, topped with a straw hat sporting an unsteady mauve ostrich feather. After a brief confrontation, she wanders off, and Szpilman and Henryk continue their way.\n\nThe scene shifts as a street band starts to play a waltz. German soldiers and Jewish policemen begin to clear a space, pushing people, including Szpilman, Henryk, and a nervous man, aside. Other soldiers join in to further clear the area. From the crowd, two German soldiers pull out a tall woman and a short man, forcing them into the cleared space to dance to the band’s waltz. In an act of cruel amusement, the soldiers continue to select increasingly mismatched couples—a fat woman with a painfully thin man, a young boy paired with an elderly woman, two men together, and two cripples—to dance. The soldiers find various levels of amusement in this spectacle, with one soldier laughing uncontrollably. The forced dancers move as quickly as they can under duress, until one of the cripples is kicked by a soldier for faltering. The tense scene is interrupted by a whistle, signaling a policeman to halt the traffic, and a barrier opens, allowing a surge of people to cross in both directions.\n\nSzpilman and Henryk enter a new setting and pause. At a table, they find their mother and father seated with a young man in uniform, Yitzchak Heller, who sports red hair and a Hitler moustache, contributing to his unusual appearance. Heller, remaining seated, merely nods at the brothers, creating an awkward silence. The tension in the room builds until the conversation runs dry. Nearby, Benek gestures towards a customer who implores Szpilman with a desperate look. Responding to the cue, Szpilman stops playing, marking a poignant end to the scene.",
    "238": "In a dimly lit establishment, a customer meticulously drops coins onto a marble surface, one at a time, under the watchful eye of a friend. The customer leans in closely, listening intently to the sound each coin makes. He discards a couple that fail to meet his standard, but his face lights up with a smile when the coins produce a clear, pure tone, which he then keeps.\n\nAs the customer nods appreciatively, the pianist, Szpilman, catches the eye of an attractive woman who flirts with him from across the room. Satisfied, the customer beams and nods his thanks to Szpilman, who then resumes his piano performance.\n\nSzpilman proceeds to walk through the streets, passing by emaciated children and beggars. He carefully steps over the lifeless bodies strewn across the sidewalk. A towering wall bisects the street, narrowing its path and separating it into two halves; buildings crowd one side, while the wall dominates the other. Szpilman continues along this divided street.\n\nSuddenly, a sharp whistle pierces the air from the Aryan side, causing Szpilman to halt. Two women emerge from a doorway, approach the wall, and look upward as two or three packages are hurled over from the Aryan side. The women quickly snatch the packages and vanish from sight.\n\nAs Szpilman walks on, he observes a child emerging through a small hole at ground level. The child squeezes through, then turns to pull a package after him before darting away. Continuing his journey, Szpilman hears a sound and turns to see another child attempting to wriggle through the same hole, but this child becomes stuck.\n\nFrom the Aryan side, angry German voices echo. Szpilman rushes to assist the trapped child, pulling with all his strength, but the boy remains jammed in the hole. From the other side of the wall, the harsh voice of a German and the violent stomping of a boot against the boy can be heard. The boy's screams of agony fill the air as Szpilman continues his desperate efforts to free him.\n\nThe relentless stomping continues, accompanied by the boy's increasingly weak and desperate screams. With each thud, the boy's cries become more pained. Szpilman, exerting all his effort, finally manages to pull the boy free from the hole. The boy, now lying on the ground, moans softly, his head lolling to the side and his jaw sagging; he is dead. Overwhelmed, Szpilman quickly rises and hurries away.\n\nSzpilman approaches a house through a neglected yard. Inside, the sound of a mimeograph machine is heard. A jovial, large man, perpetually smoking a cigarette, laughs and coughs as he sorts through papers in a room cluttered from floor to ceiling with old papers and miscellaneous items. The atmosphere is dark and run-down.\n\nOne of the man's sons, Symche, operates the mimeograph machine, while the other, Dolek, sorts the freshly printed sheets. Their mother, Mrs. Zyskind, holds a toddler as she cooks at a small stove. A distinct knock at the door causes Szpilman to tense, but Jehuda, the large man, beams in anticipation. Symche opens the door to reveal a short, tidy man named Majorek.",
    "239": "In the midst of their quiet evening, he pauses upon spotting Szpilman, who responds with a mere shrug. Nearby, Jehuda, enjoying the moment, bursts into laughter, only to be interrupted by a harsh cough. Around the modest table, the family gathers as Mother brings a saucepan of soup, beginning to serve amidst the warm glow of their home.\n\nHis laughter fills the room, drawing the eyes of the others to him. Suddenly, the family rushes to the windows, drawn by the sound of a Gestapo vehicle that has screeched to a halt on their street. From it emerge helmeted, jackbooted SS men, led by an NCO, who quickly pour out and storm into the building opposite.\n\nThe Szpilmans, with Regina quickly turning off the lights, gather at their open window to watch, hearts pounding with terror. Their view offers a clear sight of the opposite building as the SS men ascend, their heavy boots echoing on the stairs, lights flicking on floor by floor.\n\nDirectly across, a family—a businessman, his wife, three young people, and an old man in a wheelchair—are caught at their dining table when the SS men burst in, machine pistols ready. The family, frozen in horror, remains seated until the NCO scans their faces, prompting them to rise quickly, except for the old man, who struggles futilely to stand from his wheelchair.\n\nWithout hesitation, the SS men seize the wheelchair with the old man still in it and carry him out onto the balcony. The Szpilman family, watching in horror, sees Mother scream, Father recoil, while Halina and Regina offer comfort. From Szpilman and Henryk's viewpoint, the SS men brutally throw the old man and his wheelchair over the balcony. He seems to float for a moment before plummeting out of sight, the sound of his body hitting the pavement followed by the clatter of the wheelchair.\n\nMother's sobs fill the room as the others remain stunned. The night is shattered by the sound of gunfire, slamming doors, and screams. From another window, they see SS men herding dozens of prisoners from the opposite building, forcing them to stand under the harsh beams of their vehicle's headlights.\n\nPanic ensues as the prisoners start to run, and the SS men open fire with a mounted machine gun. Screams erupt from the building opposite as the prisoners are mercilessly shot down, some lifted into the air by bullets, performing grim somersaults before falling lifelessly. Amidst the chaos, one man manages to break away, running back in the opposite direction, out of the light, his silhouette fading into the distance as he exerts every ounce of strength to escape the relentless SS men.",
    "245": "Zed, engrossed in a silent melody, moves his finger from left to right before abruptly stopping. The camera then shifts right, focusing on Marsellus. Rising from his seat, Zed seizes Marsellus' chair and forcefully drags him into Russell's old room. As Marsellus is pulled away, his gaze locks with Butch just before he vanishes behind the door.\n\nButch, turning his attention to The Gimp, observes him giggling uncontrollably beneath his mask. Meanwhile, Zed's hand stealthily approaches a weapon, prompting Butch to grip his sword more firmly. The tension between Zed and Butch escalates as they study each other intensely. Suddenly, Butch steps aside, revealing Marsellus, now armed with Maynard's pump-action shotgun. Marsellus fires, blasting Zed in the groin, sending him to the ground in agonizing screams. As Zed writhes in pain, Marsellus ejects the spent shell from the shotgun, his gaze fixed on his whimpering assailant. Butch, sword lowered, hangs back before exiting through the red curtains of Russell's old room.\n\nOutside, Fabienne cautiously approaches a motorcycle. Butch, watching her, sees her start to cry. He turns off the bike's engine, reaches out to take her hand, and helps her climb on. With a rev, they speed away.\n\nThe scene shifts to the bathroom of a Hollywood apartment where the Fourth Man paces anxiously, gripping a large silver .357 Magnum. Overhearing conversations through the door, he panics, throwing himself against the back wall, gun ready, fear plastered across his face. Convinced of his next move, he bursts through the door, firing six thunderous shots from his revolver.\n\nThe focus then shifts to Jules and Vincent. As Vincent prepares to leave, they move to their car with Jules driving, Vincent in the passenger seat, and Marvin in the back. Vincent, casually holding a .45, turns to the backseat, inadvertently firing a shot that strikes Marvin in the upper chest. Marvin gurgles and shakes as blood spills from his wound.\n\nLater, in a different bathroom, Jules washes his bloody hands at a sink, with Vincent waiting behind him. After Jules dries his hands and steps away, Vincent takes his turn at the sink. Once finished, Vincent dries his hands on a white towel, which ends up stained red.\n\nFinally, the scene moves to Jimmie's kitchen where three men stand, each sipping from a mug of coffee.",
    "247": "Brett remains unable to speak as Jules, in a sudden burst of fury, violently overturns the card table, eliminating the last physical barrier between them. Now, Brett is seated alone in a chair, positioned before Jules much like a political prisoner facing an interrogator. Jules aggressively presses the barrel of his .45 hard against Brett's cheek, causing the already frightened man to regress further. Jules momentarily glances at Vincent, who smirks; in response, Jules rolls his eyes and fires a shot into Brett's shoulder. Both Jules and Vincent then unleash a barrage of gunfire, emptying their weapons simultaneously into the defenseless Brett.\n\nThe scene shifts to Butch Coolidge, a 26-year-old white prizefighter, who is seen sitting at a table adorned in a striking red and blue high school athletic jacket. Off-screen, the voice of their mutual employer, Marsellus Wallace, converses with him. An envelope stuffed with cash is placed on the table before Butch, which he promptly picks up.\n\nIn a different setting, Vincent Vega exudes coolness as he drives a 1964 cherry red Chevy Malibu convertible. He approaches a building where the front entrance is unlocked, revealing English Dave inside. Vincent, carrying the iconic black briefcase, steps inside, but English Dave quickly slams the door shut. The club, spacious and typically bustling, stands empty at this hour. English Dave moves to the bar with Vincent in tow.\n\nMeanwhile, Butch shakes hands with an imposing figure whose back is turned to the camera, later revealed to be the notorious and still unseen Marsellus. English Dave, sporting a private smile, serves Vincent his coffee at the bar. As Vincent begins to walk away, Butch slowly turns to face him but is ignored as Vincent moves out of frame, continuing toward Marsellus, whom he greets warmly with a hug and a kiss. Realizing Vincent's close ties to Marsellus, Butch wisely decides to let any potential conflict slide for the time being, distracted from his combative thoughts. After settling his bill with English Dave, Butch exits the scene.\n\nIn another segment, a woman with an evident love for body piercings is showcased; both her ears are pierced five times, and she also wears rings in her lips, eyebrows, and nose. This woman, Jody, is seated at a kitchen table in a suburban Echo Park house along with Vincent and another young woman named Trudi. Vincent, who has been largely disengaged from the conversation, perks up at Jody's last comment. Jody looks at him, stating something she considers utterly obvious, before resuming her discussion with Trudi, leaving Vincent to reflect on the truth of her words. He then pulls out an enormous roll of cash and his drug paraphernalia, proceeding to prepare his heroin for use.",

Inside, Mia moves her mouth close to a microphone as Vincent turns and walks, eventually finding an intercom mounted on the wall.\n\nOutside, Vincent's Malibu arrives at a restaurant, overshadowed by a towering neon sign of a cartoon cat in a red windbreaker. Inside, Mia frames a square with her hands, prompting dotted lines to appear and form a square on the screen before they disperse. Buddy leaves momentarily, allowing Vincent to survey the bustling scene: yuppies dancing, diners enjoying their large, juicy hamburgers, and various icons fulfilling their roles.\n\nVincent hands Mia a rolled cigarette, which she takes and places between her lips. Suddenly, Vincent produces a Zippo lighter and ignites it for her before beginning to roll one for himself. The diner suddenly fills with the sound of a subway car, causing everything to shake and rattle. Amidst this, Marilyn Monroe dashes to a square vent in the floor, eliciting applause from the entire restaurant. Buddy returns with their drinks, and Mia sips her shake through a straw as Vincent smiles, takes a sip himself, and then slides the shake back to her.\n\nIn the bathroom, Mia indulges in a large line of cocaine off the sink, her head jerking back from the rush. Returning to their table, Vincent savors his Douglas Sirk steak, his eyes scanning the eclectic, Hellsapopinish decor of the restaurant. Mia points out Marilyn Monroe in a white dress serving a table, and then gestures towards a blonde waitress in a tight sweater and capri pants taking orders from film geeks, causing both her and Vincent to smile.\n\nVincent, slow to respond, watches as patrons cheer for Ed Sullivan and Marilyn Monroe, who holds a trophy. Mia reaches for her hand as Vincent reacts. The two then make their way to the dance floor, heading towards Ed Sullivan amidst more cheering from the patrons. They approach the microphone and begin dancing, their movements forming shapes in the air.\n\nThe front door flings open, and Mia and Vincent, still in their dance, enter the house in a tango style.

    "254": "Two pedestrians assist the shaken Butch in extricating himself from the wreckage of a vehicle. Nearby, a disoriented Marsellus struggles to his feet. As Marsellus follows the direction indicated by a Gawker's finger, he spots Butch Coolidge down the street, looking disheveled. The imposing figure of Marsellus then draws a .45 Automatic, prompting the Gawkers to retreat. With determination, Marsellus starts advancing towards Butch.\n\nButch, spotting Marsellus' unsteady approach, quickly assesses the situation and positions himself next to a door. Just as Maynard is about to complete his threat, Marsellus charges into the scene. However, his momentum causes him to lose footing, and he crashes to the ground. Seizing the moment, Butch leaps onto Marsellus, delivering two more punches to his face. He then disarms Marsellus of the gun and grabs his middle finger forcefully.\n\nThe confrontation is abruptly halted when Maynard aims a pump-action shotgun at both Butch and Marsellus. Overwhelmed, Marsellus loses consciousness. When they regain consciousness, both men find themselves bound to separate chairs, gagged with S&M-style ball gags, belts circling their heads with little red balls lodged in their mouths. Maynard enters, wielding a fire extinguisher, and sprays them until they are fully alert and drenched.\n\nAs the captives glance up at their captors, Maynard stands before them, holding the fire extinguisher in one hand and the shotgun in the other, with Marsellus' .45 tucked into his belt. Without uttering another word, Maynard ascends the stairs, leaving Butch and Marsellus to survey their surroundings. In their shared predicament, all traces of animosity between the two vanish, replaced by mutual terror at their dire situation.\n\nSoon, Maynard and Zed, two hillbilly brothers, emerge through the curtains. Zed positions himself in front of the captives, inspecting them meticulously before speaking, to which Butch offers no response. Maynard then opens a trap door in the floor, reaches in, and pulls out a leash. With a harsh tug, he brings up a figure known as The Gimp, completely clad in black leather bondage gear adorned with zippers, buckles, and studs, his head encased in a mask featuring eye holes and a zipped mouth.\n\nZed places a chair in front of the prisoners, takes a seat, and receives The Gimp's leash from Maynard, who then steps back. The Gimp kneels down as Zed scrutinizes Butch and Marsellus, who are filled with terror. Maynard shifts his gaze between the victims while The Gimp's eyes move from one to the other behind the mask.",
    "257": "A man drives into a convenience store parking lot and parks his car, leaving it running as he steps out. Inside the store, a hand reaches for a package of L'Eggs pantyhose from a rack and another for a large carton of disposable diapers from a shelf. A young, acne-covered cashier, wearing a paper 7-Eleven cap, glances up from a dirty magazine in horror at the approaching figure. The man, later identified as Hi, moves towards the checkout with a gun in one hand and the carton of Huggies under the other. His face is obscured by the L'Eggs stocking he has pulled over his head.\n\nThe cashier subtly activates a silent alarm under his counter. Meanwhile, in another scene, Ed reads to their son Nathan Jr. from a large picture book. She pauses, faintly hearing a distant siren. Resuming her reading, her voice drifts off as the siren becomes more distinct and closer. Ed, now more alert, turns to look behind her car, then forward, spotting indistinct figures at the store's checkout through the semi-reflective glass, one pointing something at the other. As the siren grows louder, Ed unstraps herself and exits the vehicle.\n\nInside the store, Hi watches the cashier hurriedly stuffing bills into a grocery bag. Outside, Ed moves around the front of the car, her shout muffled by the glass. Hi, noticing her, turns to the cashier, but Ed has already slipped into the driver's seat and slams the door shut. With the siren now very loud, Ed drives the car out of the lot with a squeal of tires. A squad car appears over a rise, bouncing into view with its siren wailing.\n\nHi bursts out of the store, still wearing the stocking and carrying the Huggies, shouting after his departing car in hopeful despair. Bewildered, he scans the parking lot. The siren's wail grows painfully loud. Turning, Hi sees a bullet hole in the store's plate-glass front. Through the glass, the young cashier, having ducked behind the counter, rises and aims a massive .44 Magnum with both hands, firing another shot that smacks into the glass. Hi takes off running as the squad car screeches into the lot. An officer rolls out of the passenger side before the car stops, quickly assumes a half-kneeling shooting stance, and aims.",
    "262": "Hi advances purposefully toward Evelle, his jaw set and teeth clenched in determination. Just then, Gale steps in front of Hi, blocking his path. Gale, still talking, snaps the chamber of his .38 shut and exits the frame. Moments later, he reenters, now equipped with an automatic handgun in addition to the .38. He loads a clip into the automatic with a decisive click. Meanwhile, Hi exits the frame again, his voice heard rummaging offscreen as he continues speaking. He soon returns, both handguns tucked into his belt, and grips a pump-action shotgun. With a swift motion, Hi primes the shotgun, the sound echoing: WHOOSH-CLACK.\n\nThe scene shifts to an automobile's front bumper. A beautiful expanse of desert stretches endlessly to the horizon as the road rushes beneath the camera. Inside the car, Gale drives, his eyes fixed on the road ahead, while Evelle cradles Nathan Jr., gently bouncing the baby. Evelle, contemplative, shifts Nathan Jr. in his lap. Gale glances over just as Evelle, his face beaming with joy, looks up from the baby to meet Gale's gaze.\n\nIn a small mom-and-pop store, a carton of diapers lands on the checkout counter. Evelle stands opposite the cashier, a late-middle-aged man possibly the store's proprietor. Scattered across the counter are Evelle's various baby purchases - diapers, baby food, and more. As the cashier begins ringing up the items, Evelle, still looking around, grabs a plastic-covered squirt gun from a display rack and adds it to his pile. He then unhooks a bag of balloons from the impulse purchase display by the register. Suddenly, Evelle pulls a gun from his belt, and the cashier drops out of sight onto the floor.\n\nBack in the car, Gale drives while Evelle sorts through his purchases. Gale looks around, confusion evident on his face. Both men exchange a glance, then their heads snap to the back seat in unison. Their eyes widen in horror as they simultaneously remember something vital. Both look up at the car's roof, their faces reflecting panic. Gale eases off the accelerator, and a scream pierces the air as he watches the foot. Choked up, Gale speaks in a low, unsteady voice.\n\nThe scene transitions to Ed driving, with Hi beside her. Both stare ahead at the road in silence, Hi appearing glum yet trying to maintain kindness. He nods to himself, a gesture that cuts off any further words from him. After a moment, Hi clears his throat, the sound breaking the quiet.\n\nThe frame fills with a huge, rumbling, rippling red ball. The sound of footfalls on concrete steps is heard as Smalls comes into view, climbing a stoop. The sun behind him casts him in silhouette, the extreme telephoto lens flattening his figure against the bright backdrop. Heat waves shimmer between the camera and Smalls, causing his silhouette to waver slightly.",
    "264": "Gale and Evelle, drenched in blue paint, are consumed by rage, fear, and confusion as they scream wildly. Inside their car, blue dollar bills whirl chaotically. Gale, driving blindly, causes the vehicle to swerve erratically across the road, its windshield obscured by blue paint. He stretches forward, frantically wiping away a patch of the blue paint. As the smear clears, they spot Hi and Ed's car parked sideways, blocking their path.\n\nHi and Ed stand in front of their vehicle; Hi grips a scatter gun, while Ed holds a revolver at the ready. Ed dashes to Gale and Evelle's car, flings open the back door in a desperate search for the baby, but only retrieves Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care book. Meanwhile, Evelle, stunned and disoriented, staggers around, staring incredulously at his blue-painted body. Hi and Ed quickly jump back into their car and speed off.\n\nA serene scene unfolds with Nathan Jr. calmly seated in his car seat, positioned in the middle of the road in front of a bank. The camera pans up to reveal the deserted street beyond the baby. Suddenly, the silence is shattered by the sound of gunfire and screeching brakes, culminating in a deafening explosion that abruptly ends the wail of a police siren. The police car is obliterated, evidenced by a fireball erupting over the road ahead.\n\nThe echoes of the explosion fade, replaced by the deep rumble of an approaching engine. Over the horizon, Lenny Smalls rides his motorcycle into view, silhouetted against the backdrop of fire and smoke, heading straight for the camera and towards the baby. As Lenny crests a hill, the camera focuses on Nathan Jr. still sitting in the road, with Lenny rapidly closing the distance from behind.\n\nA low, wide shot captures the speed of Lenny's bike as it races towards Nathan Jr.'s car seat. The sound of clanking chains accompanies Lenny's hand, poised and tense, as it drops into the frame to scoop up the car seat just as they reach it. In a swift motion, Lenny grabs Nathan Jr. and lifts him out of the frame as he continues his roaring path forward. He skillfully hooks the car seat onto his handlebars and continues his approach.\n\nLenny then draws a shotgun from his back holster, aims it at the oncoming car, and fires. The shotgun blasts orange flame, shattering the car's windshield. As he speeds past, the baby remains secure on the handlebars with the road blurring by in the background. The motorcycle takes a sharp turn, and the camera, positioned through the shattered windshield of the halted car, captures the end of the skid as the vehicle rocks to a stop.",
    "266": "Ed gently places his hand over Hi's, and Hi responds by laying his other hand on top of Ed's. Hi then removes a ring from his finger and tenderly slides it onto Ed's. Meanwhile, the surly Mopping Con has advanced to the foreground, observing as Hi is escorted past him towards his cell. Midway down the corridor, Hi casually points at the floor, prompting the Mopping Con to watch him as he moves further away. The camera begins to focus closely on Hi, who stares blankly ahead, his expression distant. As Moses' voice fades away and he exits the frame, the camera tightens further on Hi, his stare intensifying.\n\nSuddenly, the underside of the top bunk is illuminated by a bright flash, which fades to reveal an image of Ed smiling behind her camera, gently superimposed on the bunk. Hi, lying on his pillow, turns his head in weary profile and closes his eyes, only to be illuminated by another flash.\n\nIn the familiar booking room, Hi and three officers are present. Ed, having just photographed another suspect against a hatched wall, looks up from her camera. Hi points at the suspect with a cocked finger. Meanwhile, Ed, dressed in a white bridal gown, nervously adjusts her attire in front of a mirror, her gaze earnest as she looks into the camera. Behind her, the congregation is seated, divided by the bride's side in police blues and the groom's side in Hawaiian shirts, all staring into the camera. Over their shoulders, the minister can be seen. The focus shifts to the newlyweds, first smiling at the camera and then at each other, their profiles to the camera.\n\nThe scene transitions to a vast desert where Hi operates a drill press, wearing goggles and sweat-stained overalls. Nearby, Bud, a shop veteran with a grimy face and goggles pushed up on his forehead, stands idly. Hi scowls at his paycheck, while behind a barred window, a fat cashier grins.\n\nLater, Hi sits in a lawn chair in front of the trailer, both he and Ed wearing sunglasses as they watch the setting sun. The scene is bathed in a warm yellow light, gradually shifting to amber as the sun descends. Hi and Ed's heads follow the sun's slow downward arc until it sets, the light turning to a neutral dusky hue. They continue to stare at the point where the sun disappeared, the dusk slipping into darkness until the scene is pitch black, filled with the sound of crickets chirping from the darkness.\n\nBack at home, Ed marks off the last day on the calendar before a day circled in red. Hi enters, weary from a long day at work and clutching his lunchpail, only for Ed to leap into his arms and cover him with kisses.",
    "273": "As Ed and two men approach the couch, Ed hesitantly speaks up. She wrinkles her nose apologetically while one of the men gazes at the baby. Gale, Evelle, and Hi, struck dumb, look up at Ed. After a pause, she glances at Hi. Gale, showing sincere concern, leans close to Hi and whispers something. An awkward silence fills the room as she exits, slamming the bedroom door. Inside, Gale examines his thumbnail meticulously while Evelle fixates on the ceiling, still focused on his thumb.\n\nLater, Hi tiptoes into the room where Ed lies facing the wall, only the back of her head visible. Sitting carefully on the bed's edge, Hi smiles and playfully pokes a finger through the crib bars to engage with the baby. The faint sound of the TV from the living room reaches them. Startled briefly, Hi continues to play with the baby until Ed finally turns to face him, followed by Hi turning to meet her gaze. The scene shifts to a downward view of Hi asleep in bed.\n\nThe camera cranes down, briefly showing a roaring wall of flames. The descent continues as the flames and their roar become more intense. As the National Anthem fades out, the sound of a test pattern's WEEEEEEEE emerges, drowned out by the ongoing roaring. Suddenly, a huge low-rider motorcycle bursts through the flames with an even louder roar, driven by a massive, leather-clad biker. The chains on the Biker clank ominously as he rides out of view, then roars back into frame, his rear tire leaving a trail of fire. He speeds along a desert highway, the camera tracking and zooming in from behind.\n\nReaching for two sawed-off shotguns strapped across his back, the Biker levels them while the camera pulls back, revealing a jack-rabbit running alongside in the foreground. The first shotgun fires, and the rabbit falls. Swinging the second gun, the Biker targets a desert lizard sunning itself on a rock in the foreground, which is then shot from a distance. The camera pans across the empty desert road stretching into the distance, where a lone desert flower blooms in the foreground. As the Biker roars into and then away from the frame, the flower bends with the draft before bursting into flame. The camera, still booming down from behind, approaches the crest of a rise.",
    "276": "The movie begins with a low, wide shot focusing on a BIKER, visible only from the shins down, as he stands in front of a gas station. The Biker takes a moment to pause, lost in thought or emotion. Suddenly, the tranquility is shattered as he dramatically bursts through the bathroom door on his motorcycle, flooding the room with bright daylight. This daylight not only reveals his silhouette but also illuminates the motes of dust dancing in the shafts of light that stream in.\n\nAttention then shifts to a jar of hair jelly, which sits prominently on a shelf under a mirror, before an extreme close-up reveals the Biker's nostrils flaring as he sniffs, intrigued by an unseen scent.\n\nThe scene transitions to a more domestic setting where Ed, in a living room surrounded by the rumpled sheets and blankets left by house guests, is bottle-feeding Nathan Jr. Nearby, Gale and another man, Evelle, are intently eating cornflakes while staring offscreen. Amidst the quiet crunching, a bead of milk dribbles down Nathan Jr.'s chin. Gale, taking a moment from his meal, sets down his spoon, picks up a cigarette that has been smoldering in an ashtray next to him, and takes a thoughtful puff while studying Ed. He then blows out the smoke, picks his spoon back up, and resumes eating his cornflakes.\n\nHi enters the room, yawning, holding a box of cornflakes mid-air. He looks over at Ed, who subtly motions towards Gale and Evelle with her eyes. Gale and Evelle, appearing somewhat confused, shift their gazes between Ed and Hi. Hi, feeling Ed's pleading look, turns his attention back to his breakfast.\n\nIn a more relaxed moment, Gale leans back and blows smoke towards the ceiling.\n\nThe scene then shifts as Hi, with Ed by his side, opens the door to welcome a young couple. Glen, a short, stocky blond man in his early thirties wearing Bermuda shorts, and Dot, dressed in slacks, heels, and a scarf over her hair, enter. Suddenly, Glen energetically smacks Dot on the backside, prompting her to spin around and slap him across the face with her purse. Dot, clenching her teeth, muffles her next shriek with her own hand before tiptoeing into the trailer, her hand still covering her mouth. Meanwhile, Glen, rubbing his cheek, seems to be more upset with himself than with Dot. He then turns towards the yard from the top of the stoop, where a group of children, aged two to seven, are seen playing energetically over Hi's car. Some are hitting it with a stick, while another sits on the hood, playing with a windshield wiper.\n\nAs Ed and Dot enter another room, they approach a crib, with Ed beaming. Ed, overwhelmed by emotion, puts her hand to her forehead as if about to faint at the sight of the baby. Overcome, she hides her face in her hands, turning away as if blinded by her feelings, before sneaking a peek through her fingers.",
    "285": "Dressed in a Kelly Green suit, she sits at her dressing table. Jeff, looking down, smiles subtly to himself. He then turns and lifts a long-focus camera to his eye. Through the lens, Miss Lonely Hearts is magnified, revealing previously unseen details. She wears ill-fitting horn-rimmed glasses perched halfway down her nose, tilting her head back to apply lipstick with their help. Pleased with the result, she removes the glasses and squints at her overall appearance.\n\nHer middle-aged appearance is accentuated by her hairstyle. Despite her faded beauty and decent clothing, she desperately needs advice on her hairdo. She reaches for a tall glass of liquor beside her, taking a long sip. After setting the glass down, she checks if her lipstick has smudged, but unable to see clearly, she puts her glasses back on, slightly touches up her lips, and then places the glasses into her handbag. She stands to turn off the lights, walks into the living room while finishing her drink. The long-focus lens follows her movement. She heads directly to a liquor bottle, pours herself a final neat shot, and downs it quickly. With a determined air, she exits the apartment, turning off the lights behind her.\n\nJeff lowers the long-focus lens and turns his head to the right upon hearing the initial notes of a melody that the songwriter has been struggling to complete. Dressed in black tie and readying his apartment for guests, Jeff watches as an attractive girl arranges trays of canapés, glasses, ice, and liquor. She pauses mid-stride, carrying a tray of food, to listen to the songwriter's melody. She shares her thoughts with the songwriter, prompting him to play the melody again, this time more fully. Her face reveals that the music touches her deeply, stirring romantic feelings within her.\n\nJeff's attention shifts again. Miss Torso and a previously unseen male partner are practicing a pas de deux. Their dance is interrupted by the introduction of modern orchestral ballet music, which competes with the piano's melody. The male dancer, tall with flowing hair, moves with a grace that exceeds typical male ability. They pause during their performance to listen to feedback from a woman who, by her gestures, is clearly a professional choreographer.\n\nThe camera then pans from the scene to the street outside, where a figure dressed in Kelly Green stands on the sidewalk, scanning the street up and down.",
    "286": "A woman, seemingly uncertain, contemplates her next move or destination. She casts nervous glances at a couple of men passing by. Suddenly, a man swiftly raises a long-focus camera to his eye. The camera adjusts to a waist-high shot, focusing on a figure identified as Miss Lonely Hearts. \n\nGetting no response, she crosses the street and settles at an unoccupied table outside a cafe. She orders a drink. Her presence is abruptly obscured by a man, Thorwald, entering the frame from the left, carrying a lightweight cardboard box. The camera follows him as he moves to the right until he disappears behind a building. Being closer to the camera on this side of the street, Thorwald appears slightly out of focus.\n\nThe man behind the camera, Jeff, lowers the lens, his eyes tracking Thorwald's imagined path across the screen. Sharpening his focus, Jeff picks up the long-focus lens again, cautiously repositioning himself to observe Thorwald more closely. Thorwald approaches his apartment door, fumbling with the keys. As he pauses, the cardboard box he carries reveals a laundry name printed on it.\n\nEntering his apartment, Thorwald switches on the living room lights. He moves to the bedroom, illuminating it as well. On the bed lies an orderly stack of suits and topcoats. Thorwald removes laundry from the box, placing it beside the suits. Instead of storing the laundry, he begins emptying the dresser drawers of pajamas, shirts, socks, and more, piling them onto the bed.\n\nJeff quickly lowers his camera. He grabs the phone, dials a number, and keeps a watchful eye on Thorwald. The phone rings faintly before being answered by a woman. A look of desperation briefly crosses Jeff's face. As he talks, he thoughtfully removes jewelry from a handbag—rings, a diamond wristwatch, a brooch, pearls, and more—pondering over each piece as if trying to reach a decision.\n\nLeaning forward in his chair, Jeff tries to overhear Thorwald's conversation but soon abandons the effort. He lifts the long-focus lens to his eyes once more.\n\nMeanwhile, the first four guests of a songwriter arrive at his door, welcomed by his girlfriend. The songwriter bursts into a loud, welcoming tune on the piano before rising to serve drinks. Jeff, however, refocuses his attention on Thorwald.",
    "290": "In the tense atmosphere of Jeff's apartment, Doyle casts a scathing glance at Lisa. Jeff boldly challenges Doyle, prompting a cold response from Lisa. Doyle, momentarily hesitant, lets his gaze drift to the overnight case containing Lisa's lingerie before his eyes return to Jeff. Jeff replies sharply, leaving Lisa puzzled as she looks down at him. Meanwhile, Doyle casually wipes his coat lapels with a handkerchief, showing no hint of warmth toward Jeff or Lisa, whose faces remain cold and set. Despite the chill in the room, Doyle maintains a pleasant demeanor as he prepares to leave, picking up his hat and moving toward the door with a relaxed air. Before exiting, he snaps his fingers, puts on his hat with a smile, and quietly closes the door behind him.\n\nOnce Doyle leaves, Jeff turns his chair to look out at the neighborhood, with Lisa standing glumly behind him. The contrast between their somber mood and the lively, crowded song-writer's party nearby is stark. The party exudes happiness and gaiety, yet none of this cheer reaches Lisa and Jeff. In another apartment, Miss Torso exercises on her divan, her legs swinging in arcs to the rhythm of record music, while her door remains closed.\n\nThroughout this time, Lisa's gaze remains fixed on Thorwald's apartment, not aligned with Jeff's direction. She murmurs to him, and then her focus shifts to the apartment below. Jeff follows her gaze, only to witness Miss Lonely Hearts' surprising return with a much younger, eager lover. As Miss Lonely Hearts sips her drink coyly, her companion quickly downs his with nervous excitement. He approaches her cautiously, initiating a long kiss and caressing her cheek, ear, and neck.\n\nSuddenly, Miss Lonely Hearts fiercely pushes him away and slaps him across the face. Stunned, he recoils as she vehemently orders him to leave. His face flushes with anger and embarrassment, and he retorts with harsh words before storming out, slamming the door. Left alone, Miss Lonely Hearts attempts to clean up the spilled liquor, but soon collapses onto the rug, her body shaking with sobs.\n\nBack in Jeff's apartment, Lisa, feeling the weight of the evening, turns from Jeff's chair to fetch a cigarette from the table.",
    "291": "Jeff sits in a wheelchair by the bar, a drink in his hand. As he begins to sip, Lisa emerges from the kitchen, an ethereal vision in a sheer peach nightgown, gracefully covered by a matching gossamer kimono. She turns before him with elegance, prompting Jeff to lower his drink.\n\nMeanwhile, at a nearby apartment, a woman, affected by recent news, momentarily stops sobbing. Her hands grip the fire escape's railing fiercely. Guests from a songwriter's party quietly retreat back to the studio apartment, moving from their balconies indoors. The woman, now agitated, almost screams at the returning crowd as she gazes up at the apartment.\n\nElsewhere, a husband leans over the fire escape, signaling Miss Lonely Hearts to place a dog into a basket already hanging there. She complies, watching intently as the husband carefully pulls the basket up, hand over hand, until the dog nears the fire escape. Gently, he removes the dog from the basket. Overcome with emotion, Miss Lonely Hearts returns to her apartment, her sobs fading into the distance.\n\nThe newlyweds, seeking privacy, draw their shades again. The landlord steps away from the window, and both Miss Torso and Miss Hearing Aid retreat to their respective apartments, the latter turning down the volume of her hearing aid.\n\nBack at Jeff's apartment, he and Lisa stand by the window, his hand clasping hers. Jeff speaks without lifting his gaze. Their attention shifts to Thorwald's apartment, where the only visible light is the faint glow of a cigar, suggesting Thorwald sits quietly on his sofa, smoking. Lisa glances at Jeff, who nods solemnly before they both return their focus to the dark apartment, the cigar's glow the only unchanged element.\n\nJoined by Stella, Jeff, Lisa, and she group at the window, observed from behind by the camera. Jeff peers through a long-focus lens, focusing on Thorwald's activities in the bathroom, where he meticulously wipes the enameled wall with a damp cloth, paying close attention to specific spots. The view shifts to the upper part of Thorwald's bedroom window, with the lower part obscured by a wall. Over this scene, sounds are heard.\n\nJeff lowers the camera, and their faces come into view. Neither he nor Lisa offers any comments, maintaining a silent watch over the unfolding events.",
    "292": "In a tense moment, Stella suddenly blurts out, interrupting Lisa as she turns away from the window. Meanwhile, Jeff, still fixated on the view outside, wears an expression of sudden realization. He quickly calls out, turning halfway around to point, while Lisa moves behind him toward the shelf. As he continues speaking, he turns back to the window, extending his right hand to the side, anticipating the arrival of the box and viewer. Lisa approaches, places the items in his hand, and Jeff opens the box to reveal color slides. He examines one or two slides up to the light, as Lisa watches him with curiosity and Stella steps forward from the background. Squinting through the viewer and then without it, Jeff hands the viewer to Lisa, who raises it to her eye. Through the viewer, the scene outside the window appears identical, but when she lowers it, a slight breeze stirs the foliage, making the scene less static. Jeff looks up at a puzzled Lisa, and all three of them ease back in awe. As Lisa continues to look out the window and speaks, Stella begins to chuckle, her face sobering as she answers their unspoken question. Jeff's attention shifts to Stella, but he interrupts Lisa's speech to speak himself.\n\nSuddenly, Lisa appears at the ground floor door below Thorwald's apartment. Tensely pressing back against the wall, she hides as Thorwald, frustrated, returns in the corridor above and comes out onto the fire escape directly above her. Aware of his presence, Lisa immediately retreats into the doorway and disappears down the lower corridor while Thorwald searches his fire escape. A sigh of relief escapes both of them. Jeff hands something to her, and Stella, noticing something, knits her brow, reaching for the long focus lens and lifting it to her eye.\n\nIn Miss Lonely Hearts' apartment, a candle burns in a holder, accompanied by other lamps lighting the space. Dressed in sedate street clothes and appearing quite at peace, Miss Lonely Hearts sits at her little table, its white tablecloth adorned with four red capsules she has taken from a small brown bottle. By the candle's light, she opens a black-covered book with fine print and begins reading. She briefly bends over the book, glances at the capsules, and returns to reading. Meanwhile, Stella and Jeff's voices can be heard. Lisa then comes down the stairs and approaches them.",
    "295": "Thorwald unlocks his apartment door with his key and enters, prompting Lisa to hurriedly retreat into the bedroom, narrowly escaping his sight. Meanwhile, Stella gazes out the window, her body tense and fear evident in her eyes. A policeman, displaying irritation over the phone, repeats his instructions. Suddenly, Stella's expression shifts as she turns her gaze slightly left.\n\nThe lead policeman instructs Lisa to accompany him, while he directs the second officer to obtain a statement from Thorwald regarding the attempted burglary. The second policeman then examines the jewelry Thorwald holds. In the brief moment the officers converse, Lisa subtly begins waving her left hand behind her back, a movement captured more closely by the camera. She then ceases waving, spreading her fingers and using her other hand to indicate the wedding ring on her left hand.\n\nThrough the lens of Jeff's camera, which pans upward and across to frame Thorwald's profile, Thorwald notices Lisa's actions and turns to stare directly into the camera, realizing she is signaling to an observer. Jeff and Stella, caught in this tense moment, react swiftly; Jeff drops the camera into his lap, and Stella rushes from the window, extinguishing the lights as Jeff rolls his chair back into the room.\n\nAs Thorwald turns his attention back to the second policeman to continue answering questions, the first policeman escorts Lisa out of the apartment. Jeff, from his position, directs Stella to a drawer in the wall cabinets. With the last light off, Stella, breathless, turns to Jeff after retrieving a billfold from the drawer and handing it to him. Jeff counts the money inside, glancing sharply at Stella before resuming without comment, as she makes her observations and retrieves her purse.\n\nObserving through his camera, Jeff sees Thorwald exit his apartment and proceed down the corridor. Stella approaches the door, pausing momentarily, as Jeff picks up the phone and hangs up just as he notices Thorwald's now darkened apartment. Thorwald becomes slightly visible at the top of the stairs, and Jeff, puzzled yet silent, steps forward, gripping the flash holder more tightly, ready to use it. Thorwald, advancing to the middle of the room, locks eyes with Jeff, his hands clenching in an effort to control his evident anger.",
    "296": "The movie begins as a man takes a step forward. Thorwald then descends two steps and pauses at the bottom. Meanwhile, Miss Lonely Hearts stands in the yard outside her apartment, gazing up at Miss Torso's porch. A tense struggle ensues between Thorwald and Jeff, where Thorwald tries to break Jeff's hold. The camera focuses on Jeff’s face, revealing his strain and the agony inflicted by Thorwald's assault. Doyle, in a separate scene, pulls himself to the top of a wall. From Doyle's perspective, Jeff is seen precariously hanging out of a window as Thorwald relentlessly hammers at his hands and arms with his bare fists. Their struggle continues unabated. As Doyle reaches the top of the wall, he looks up at Jeff, who, despite Thorwald's relentless attack, manages to hold on. Jeff's grip begins to weaken.\n\nLisa appears, her face pale and gripped by fear. Jeff opens his eyes, wincing in pain. Doyle, now at the top of the wall, shifts his gaze upward to a detective. Nearby, Stella pulls at Doyle's arm, rising on tiptoe to whisper something into his ear, prompting Doyle to look at her quizzically. The camera then pans from right to left around the neighborhood, starting at Jeff's window thermometer. In the songwriter's apartment, Miss Lonely Hearts is a guest. The songwriter plays the first recording of his new song on a record player for her to hear. She appears happy and well-adjusted in both dress and demeanor, as the full symphonic arrangement plays.\n\nThorwald's apartment is now empty, stripped of all its furnishings, with two painters busy repainting the walls. Elsewhere, the siffleuse and her husband are on their fire escape, training their new white dog to ride in their basket. Miss Torso, dressed in a white leotard, resumes her ballet practice. Her routine is interrupted by a knock at the door. She cautiously opens it a slight crack but upon seeing the visitor, she flings the door wide open. An unremarkable, slightly shy army private enters, carrying a barracks bag over one shoulder. After closing the door, Miss Torso kisses him affectionately. He then drops his bag, tosses his hat onto a chair, and with the ease of familiarity, heads to the icebox to check for food.\n\nThe newlyweds are seen arguing. The camera pans past Jeff, who is asleep in his wheelchair facing away from the window. The camera then moves down to show both of Jeff's legs now encased in casts. It lifts slightly to reveal Lisa sitting on a nearby sofa. She is dressed in Levis and a plaid cotton shirt, immersed in a travel book. She glances up at Jeff briefly, and seeing he is asleep, she sets the travel book aside and picks up the latest issue of Harper's Bazaar.",
    "300": "As the scene unfolds, Carl emerges from the kitchen, his hands occupied with an empty warming oven which he carefully sets down. Nearby, Lisa grapples with a corkscrew, struggling to open a bottle of wine. With a casual motion, Carl pockets some money without even glancing at it before picking up the warming oven again.\n\nLisa, with a playful laugh tinged with a hint of reproach, momentarily breaks away from her efforts and directs a glance towards Jeff. She then sips her drink and speaks, placing her glass back on the table with a gentle clink. She glides along the window seat closer to him, her movement captured by the camera which zooms in, intensifying the moment. Looking up at Jeff with a candid seriousness, she awaits his reaction, which comes as a short chuckle. Jeff's relief is palpable as he exhales deeply, his gaze lowering to his legs in contemplation.\n\nBehind him, Lisa is seen preparing a card table, draping it with a cloth. Meanwhile, Jeff's focus shifts beyond his immediate surroundings, seemingly shaking off his concerns to survey the happenings in his neighborhood through the window.\n\nHis attention is drawn to an apartment he hasn't noticed before, belonging to a solitary woman around forty years old, who lives by herself. At that moment, she's seen applying makeup in front of her bedroom mirror, her attire a somewhat unflattering dress that hangs loosely on her flat chest, as if she's readying herself for a social encounter.\n\nJeff's curiosity piques, leaning forward to watch more intently. The camera pans slightly to reveal the woman's living room window, offering a clearer, more personal view of her. A thin, unattractive spinster enters the room with a smile, heading towards a small, candle-lit table set for two. She approaches the door, opens it, and mimes welcoming an imaginary guest. In her pantomime, she lightly kisses him, takes his hat, and places it on a chair. She then guides him to sit at the table, momentarily disappears into the kitchen, and returns with a bottle and two glasses.\n\nShe takes her seat, pours two drinks, and raises her glass in a toast to her unseen companion across the table. Jeff, witnessing this from his window, offers a faint, sympathetic smile and subconsciously lifts his own glass in response, taking a sip while his eyes remain fixed on the scene. As he drinks, his gaze shifts slightly.\n\nAcross the way, the woman starts to sip her drink, smiling at her imaginary guest. However, her smile soon fades, and her head drops in a moment of melancholy as she sets her glass back on the table.",
    "302": "In the early morning, the newlyweds' apartment remains shrouded in darkness with the shades drawn, yet a faint light glows from within. Jeff, observing from a distance, wears a gentle, warm smile as he gazes at the covered window. His attention then shifts, his eyes scanning the neighborhood to his right, his expression turning somber at the sights he encounters until something catches his interest, compelling him to fix his gaze.\n\nMeanwhile, in the salesman's apartment, a scene unfolds across both the living room and bedroom. The salesman, having prepared a dinner tray, moves it from the kitchen through the living room and into the bedroom, where he places it on his wife's lap as she sits up in bed. He thoughtfully arranges a couple of pillows behind her to enhance her comfort. Despite his efforts, her demeanor reflects dissatisfaction, and she begins to criticize him. He initially responds but quickly reconsiders, opting instead to leave the room. Reluctantly, the wife starts to eat the meal he has brought her.\n\nIn another part of the apartment, the husband quietly lifts the phone from its cradle and dials a number. Sensing something amiss, the wife shifts the tray aside, gets out of bed, and stealthily moves to the bedroom door to eavesdrop. The husband, meanwhile, heads to the kitchen, reaches up to a wall cabinet, retrieves a bottle, and pours himself a drink. Back in the bedroom, his wife becomes aware of the phone call, and his demeanor shifts noticeably as he waits for the connection to be made. He relaxes, a warm smile spreading across his face as he converses softly, occasionally casting a wary glance towards the bedroom door.\n\nFully engrossed by the unfolding drama, Jeff leans forward slightly. The wall partially obstructs the view, but suddenly, the wife's arm bursts into the living room, pointing accusingly at her husband and the telephone. Reacting swiftly, the salesman speaks into the phone before hanging up, his face flushing with anger as he marches toward the bedroom. Inside, his wife, now walking back to the bed, is followed by her furious husband. Her laughter only fuels his anger, escalating their confrontation. The harder she laughs, the more enraged he becomes, until she finally climbs back into bed, still laughing. Frustrated, he exits the room, traverses the living room, returns to the kitchen, and pours himself another drink.\n\nHis gaze then wanders toward the composer's apartment. Through the studio window, the songwriter is seen working diligently on his melody, having progressed further along the line of his composition than before. At the same time, Lisa emerges from her kitchen, carrying a serving dish of their lobster thermidor, signaling a return to more personal, perhaps more peaceful, moments.",
    "309": "On Evan's 14th birthday, he joyously blows out the candles on his cake, surrounded by friends. Suddenly, the celebration turns alarming as blood gushes from Evan's nose, prompting an immediate response from Lenny, who leaps out of bed to assist him. Kayleigh, now naturally beautiful, also rushes to help. In a touching yet bittersweet scene, Tommy and Kayleigh load Evan's lap with popcorn and drinks, while Lenny propels Evan's wheelchair forward.\n\nLater, a more mature scene unfolds as Evan drinks from a beer cap, watching Lenny and Kayleigh passionately kissing, with Tommy giving a bashful nod of approval. The atmosphere shifts as Evan suffers in pain while Kayleigh urgently opens dorm doors, allowing Lenny to rush Evan's wheelchair through.\n\nKayleigh holds a pair of prosthetic arms, a symbol of hope and adaptation. In a poignant moment, Evan attempts to move, launching forward and clumsily falling from his wheelchair. Amidst this, Evan tries to focus on Lenny but is distracted by a jeering crowd in the background. Kayleigh bravely confronts the mocking onlookers, who eventually disperse.\n\nLenny and Kayleigh then guide Evan's wheelchair around the quad, where Evan sports his new prosthetic arms. As they navigate the campus, Evan notices another character whose eyes light up upon seeing him. Kayleigh's gaze meets Evan's, and she rolls him away from the group towards a bench where she sits down. Casually, she uses her foot to turn his chair to face her and offers him a granola bar. However, Evan's prosthetic hand inadvertently crushes it into dust, a moment of frustration evident as Kayleigh shakes her head sadly before her attention shifts to Lenny waving her over. She touches Evan's shoulder comfortingly before joining Lenny, leaving Evan watching them with unbreakable focus, his heart aching as he sees them kiss.\n\nOverwhelmed by despair, Evan turns his stump to start filling a bathtub. Fully clothed, he lies down as the water slowly envelops him, eventually reaching his nostrils. In a moment of resignation, Evan takes a final breath as the water overflows. Tommy enters the scene, operating a lever that allows the mechanical wheelchair to exit the room. Meanwhile, Lenny sorts through Evan's belongings, tossing out old report cards, books, toys, and photo albums onto the floor. Evan's face lights up seeing his old journal among the items, and as he begins reading it silently, Lenny watches, utterly perplexed.\n\nSuddenly, Evan finds himself in his childhood kitchen, springing to his feet and flexing his real hands in triumph. He searches through a utensil drawer, grabs a large butcher knife, and attempts to tuck it into his sock, though it doesn't fit.",
    "314": "Evan, visibly shocked, gazes at the machine. In the basement, Mr. Miller sets up a camera on a tripod. Kayleigh and Evan take their places on folding chairs facing the camera. At the top of the basement stairs, Tommy peers downward. Mr. Miller, lowering his voice, addresses Evan and Kayleigh before moving behind the camera's lens. Meanwhile, an unseen figure silently opens the door at the top of the stairs and watches the scene unfold with horror. This person then descends, stands behind Kayleigh, and tightly covers her ears, rendering her unable to hear. Evan leans in to whisper to Kayleigh, who, after staring at the floor, looks up at her father and shivers. Suddenly, Evan turns and catches Kayleigh's gaze on him, startling him so much that he recoils and falls to the ground. Kayleigh, witnessing blood trickle from Evan's nose, widens her eyes in shock. From the floor, Evan, still in disbelief, can only stare up.\n\nLater, Evan finds himself in the middle of Kayleigh's bedroom, surrounded by sorority awards and pink, preppy decorations. As Kayleigh hands him a tissue, Evan can barely take his eyes off her. He then reaches for his clothes at the bed's foot, pulling out a fraternity sweatshirt adorned with Greek letters and a brown suede jacket. Disgusted, Evan grabs a towel and leaves the room. At the sink, he washes the blood from his face and examines his reflection in the mirror. Just then, Gwen, a sorority girl from the bar, exits the shower naked, pats Evan's behind, and leaves the bathroom.\n\nOn campus, Kayleigh, dressed in a long skirt and a tight red sweater, turns heads. She and Evan walk arm-in-arm across the quad, with many students waving and calling out to Evan. Suddenly, Kayleigh gives Evan an unexpected kiss and walks away, leaving him momentarily stunned before he rushes off to class. At the lobby's pay phone, Evan inserts his last quarter and dials a number, then hangs up and checks his watch. As he does, Thumper passes by, leaving Evan baffled. Evan hurries into the lecture hall and joins the line of students waiting to take No. 2 pencils from a box on Professor Carter's desk. He then walks up the aisle and sits down, only to feel an arm menacingly wrap around his throat. Turning around, Evan sees Hunter, the frat guy assaulted by Thumper at Dirty Hank's bar the other night, who surreptitiously slips him a cheat sheet for the exam. Evan nods and smiles as the exams are distributed down his row. \n\nFinally, Evan and Kayleigh have just finished having sex.",
    "316": "As the prison echoes with the jeers and catcalls from seasoned inmates, Evan, a newcomer, strives to remain composed while heading to his cell. Upon glancing upward, he spots Karl, a towering, muscular convict adorned with swastika tattoos, provocatively blowing a kiss and winking at him from the second tier.\n\nEntering his new abode, Evan finds a dimly lit cell adorned with images of Jesus Christ and various saints. Here, he meets Carlos, a formidable Hispanic man in his 30s, marked by extensive jailhouse tattoos of a suffering Christ, sitting on the lower bunk. Carlos watches Evan with a disinterested gaze as Evan sets up his bed on the top bunk. Without a word, Carlos soon exits the cell.\n\nLater, Evan joins Carlos and other inmates at a cafeteria table, where Carlos nonchalantly offers him a roll. The scene shifts to Evan talking to Andrea through a Plexiglas barrier, using monitored phones. Andrea, now sporting bottle-blonde hair, nods while holding up two composition books. Their conversation ends with Evan slowly lowering his phone, followed by him hanging up, while Andrea remains with the phone pressed to her ear.\n\nNavigating the prison corridors, Evan follows closely behind Carlos, clutching his journals. As he passes by, Karl, the Neo-Nazi, aggressively grabs Evan's crotch. Stunned and unable to respond, Evan is further assaulted when another Neo-Nazi, Rick, knocks his journals to the ground. Regaining his composure, Evan scrambles to retrieve them, engaging in a brief tug-of-war with Rick, who ultimately tears the journals away, leaving Evan with only a few ripped pages. Overwhelmed by the damage, Evan becomes furious, studying a tattered journal entry as he wraps up a conversation.\n\nThe scene transitions to a flashback of Evan in Mrs. Boswell's first-grade class, where children are busily drawing colorful pictures. As Evan attempts to join them, Mrs. Boswell firmly redirects him to his desk. Feeling defeated, Evan looks at his blank paper but soon grins mischievously and grabs some colored pencils. He begins to sketch, and a disturbing image takes shape: Evan holding a knife over the lifeless bodies of Karl and Rick.\n\nFinishing his drawing, Evan sneaks to Mrs. Boswell's desk, where he notices two paper spindles with notes and messages pinned by metal needles. With all the strength his seven-year-old body can muster, Evan attempts to slam his hands down onto the spindles. Just before impact, the sounds around him clash and the world behind him vibrates intensely.",
    "319": "As the ominous pull of the ring compels him, Frodo's trembling hand reaches out, but he collapses to the ground, unable to resist its force. The Witch King, snarling menacingly, leaps forward and thrusts a sinister dagger into Frodo's shoulder, causing the hobbit to wince in pain. In a heroic response, Strider charges at the Ringwraiths, brandishing a sword in one hand and a flaming torch in the other, his movements slowed and surreal through the swirling mist.\n\nFrodo, weakened by the wound, slumps to the ground but with his last reserves of strength, he manages to remove the ring from his finger, reappearing in the tangible world where Sam rushes to his side. A chilling cry from a distant Ringwraith pierces the air, and Frodo gasps sharply, overwhelmed by pain. Amidst the looming darkness, Sam and Strider frantically scour the forest floor in search of the Athelas plant, a vital remedy. Upon spotting its small, white flowers, Strider kneels and carefully uproots the plant.\n\nStrider, looking up slowly, sees Frodo struggling to breathe, his condition deteriorating rapidly. Through Frodo's half-conscious perspective, a shimmering figure in white leaps from a horse, revealing itself as Arwen, an ethereal vision at first but soon transforming into her earthbound form: a young Elven woman with tousled hair and mud-splattered riding attire. Despite the visible difficulty in parting from her, Strider watches as Arwen mounts her horse, Asfaloth, and, with one hand supporting Frodo, rides off into the night, pursued by the haunting howls of the Ringwraiths.\n\nFrom an aerial view, Asfaloth emerges from the forest, galloping across open land with the rising sun at their backs. The white horse races through a pine forest, the scenery blurring past in a moonlit flurry. Suddenly, two Ringwraiths burst from the trees in pursuit, quickly joined by two more from different angles, escalating to a total of nine Ringwraiths relentlessly chasing Arwen and Frodo. Arwen, gritting her teeth, urges Asfaloth to surge forward with even greater speed.\n\nLeading the Ringwraiths across the Ford, the Witch King screeches in rage and brandishes his sword. Arwen, feeling Frodo's life slipping away in her arms, witnesses a sudden burst of bright light that forces Frodo to squeeze his eyes shut in agony. When Frodo's eyes flutter open again, he finds himself lying in bed next to an open window, bathed in dappled sunlight that dances across richly carved timbers, the sound of a nearby waterfall mingling with the rustling of fir trees. Nearby, Gandalf sits, calmly puffing on his pipe, a reassuring presence in Frodo's recovery.",
    "320": "Gandalf smiles warmly at Frodo, who sits up and looks at him with a questioning gaze. Frodo appears troubled as his eyes drift away. Meanwhile, Saruman stands ominously over Gandalf, gloating with satisfaction. Using the power of his staff, Saruman lifts Gandalf from the ground before violently sending him crashing back to the floor. In a sudden, desperate move, Gandalf lurches to his feet and throws himself off the tower. Saruman watches as Gandalf escapes on the back of a majestic giant eagle, Gwaihir, soaring over mountains towards the dawn.\n\nBack at Frodo's bedside, Sam rushes over, his face lighting up with joy to see Frodo awake. Frodo's face, neither old nor young, bears the marks of many experiences, both joyful and sorrowful. Sam, still smiling, looks past Frodo to see a bent figure sitting alone on a bench in the sun. Following Sam's gaze, Frodo turns and sees Bilbo Baggins. Bilbo breaks into a broad grin as Frodo rushes forward to embrace him, noting how significantly Bilbo has aged since their last meeting.\n\nFrodo is seen turning the pages of a red leather-bound journal, admiring the beautiful handwriting, intricate maps, and drawings. Sitting on a terrace overlooking a waterfall with Bilbo, Frodo flips to a page revealing a detailed map of the Shire. Bilbo smiles proudly at the sight.\n\nSam, meanwhile, busily stuffs his already full pack with more items: pots, pans, blankets, cooking utensils, provisions, and clothes. He looks up, startled. From Elrond's balcony, Gandalf and Elrond observe Frodo and Sam. Elrond turns away, and Gandalf gazes out the window.\n\nIn a flashback, Isildur uses a broken sword to slice off Sauron's finger, prompting a reaction from Elrond. Isildur then turns and walks away. In the shadows, Strider watches as Boromir strolls through a darkened gallery, his eyes drawn to an old fresco on the wall depicting Isildur's defeat of Sauron. Boromir gazes with wonder at Narsil, the broken blade of Elendil, displayed on a cloth-covered plinth. Sensing Strider's presence, Boromir looks from the blade to Strider, feeling a connection.\n\nAs night falls over the serene valley of Rivendell, Strider and Arwen stand on a stone bridge. The Evenstar at Arwen's breast glows softly in the moonlight. Arwen looks deeply into Strider's eyes, closes his fingers around the jewel, and leans in to kiss him gently.\n\nElrond addresses a council of the free peoples of Middle-earth, including Gandalf, Strider, Legolas, and others. Frodo, seated among them, steps forward to a stone plinth, places the ring on it, and then returns to his seat. Strider remains silent while Boromir turns away dismissively and then sharply back. Legolas stands, and Frodo looks questioningly at Strider.",
    "326": "Lurtz leads 200 Uruk-hai warriors out of Isengard, their powerful legs propelling them at a swift pace. Meanwhile, the Fellowship embarks on their journey in small elven boats, silently watched by elves as they row away from the Lothlorien shore into the Silverlode river. In his mind, Frodo continues to hear Galadriel's voice, even as she presents him with a small Crystal Phial from the banks of the river, watching their boats drift by into the great river Anduin.\n\nThe Three Elven boats carry the Fellowship steadily southward, the landscape around them transitioning from lush green to a barren, withered brown. Meanwhile, the Uruk forces run through the trees with deadly intent, observed with concern by Aragorn. As the pre-dawn light bathes the scene, the boats drift slowly through a steep, rocky gorge, with Aragorn quietly paddling in the stern.\n\nFrodo, mesmerized, slowly looks up, his eyes widening in amazement at the sight of two enormous rock statues. These towering figures, resembling 300-foot pinnacles on either side of the river, are carved images of ancient Gondorian kings. The statues loom over the boats with an aura of power and majesty as the Fellowship stares in stunned silence, the current carrying them through the narrow gap between the statues' feet. The view cranes up past the vast, crumbling heads of the statues to reveal a large lake a mere mile downriver.\n\nUpon reaching the shore, the Fellowship leaps out of the boats and clambers onto the wooded bank. Legolas turns to Aragorn with urgency, and though Aragorn's look back conveys understanding, Legolas casts a cautious glance into the Parth Galen forest. Nearby, Sam slumps asleep while Merry drops a small pile of kindling at Gimli's feet. Suddenly, Sam sits up with a start, and Aragorn's head snaps around, his eyes immediately drawn to Boromir's abandoned shield by his camp bed, realizing that Boromir has gone.\n\nFrodo, walking beneath the trees and lost in thought, turns slowly to face a tense and cautious Boromir who starts forward. As Boromir approaches, Frodo steps hurriedly away, turning to leave. In a desperate move, Boromir leaps onto Frodo, grasping for the ring. With only moments to react, Frodo rips the ring from around his neck and slips it onto his finger.\n\nNow in the misty twilight world, Frodo races past the foggy shapes of twisted trees, Boromir's distraught voice echoing from another dimension. Ahead looms the formidable presence of Barad-dur, the fortress of Sauron, standing like a mountain of iron, immeasurably strong. Suddenly, Frodo finds himself on stone steps, clambering up to a high seat perched on four stone pillars. Cowering on the seat, Frodo feels like a lost child upon the throne of mountain kings, as the world of mist swirls ominously around him.",
    "328": "In the waning days of a long, hot summer, a small rock protrudes from an expanse of overgrown grasses dotted with scattered white flowers, creating an idyllic setting. On this serene patch, a figure reclines, engrossed in a book. Suddenly, the figure, revealed as a handsome young Hobbit named Frodo Baggins with dark curly hair and deep blue eyes, sits up and looks directly at the camera, his eyes alight with excitement. He discards the long stem of grass he had been chewing and dashes away.\n\nThe scene shifts to a leafy lane where a cart, driven by a stooped figure in grey, rattles along. An old pony, harnessed to the cart, snorts and rears, disturbed. The camera then tracks to another scene sixty years later, where a figure lies beneath the dappled sunlight of an old tree.\n\nUnexpectedly, Frodo appears on a bank overlooking the cart. He and the driver, now revealed as Gandalf, lock eyes for a moment before both erupt into laughter. Frodo's face breaks into a broad smile, and he leaps onto the front seat of the cart. As it continues its journey, it passes a field of lupins being tended and rolls over a stone bridge towards a bustling Hobbit marketplace.\n\nGandalf, with a twinkle in his eye, surveys the peaceful scene before him. The cart, carrying Gandalf and Frodo, rolls past the Green Dragon Inn, eliciting exclamations of wonder and excitement from the Hobbits who watch. It proceeds towards the party field, where scores of Hobbits are busily preparing for a grand celebration.\n\nAs the cart makes its way through the quaint village of Hobbiton, nestled among rolling green hills and large trees, Odo Proudfoot eyes the cart suspiciously as it passes. Excited children chase after it, but Gandalf, ignoring their cries, leaves them deflated as they watch him disappear up the lane. However, the mood quickly lifts as spinning balls of bright colors suddenly leap from the cart, fizzing over the heads of the delighted children. Gandalf, pleased with his playful trick, smiles to himself.\n\nOdo Proudfoot, despite his initial suspicion, cannot help but chuckle at the spectacle. In the cart, as Gandalf reins in the horse, Frodo stands up. They arrive at Bag End, a particularly fine Hobbit hole distinguished by its large round front door set into a grassy hillside. Gandalf raises his staff and knocks on the door, prompting a voice from inside to respond.\n\nThe door swings open to reveal Bilbo Baggins, a Hobbit of indeterminate age with a mischievous twinkle in his eye. Dressed in a dashing brocade waistcoat, he embodies the eccentric gentleman. Gandalf, moved by the reunion, drops to his knee to embrace his old friend warmly.",
    "329": "As Gandalf keenly observes Bilbo, the wizard is led into the cozy, cluttered Bag End, where he must stoop to avoid the low ceiling. Bilbo, ever the gracious host, hangs Gandalf's hat on a peg before trotting down the hall and disappearing into the kitchen. Gandalf, enjoying the familiar surroundings, knocks his head on a light and then walks into a wooden beam, prompting a groan. His attention is then drawn to a framed map, charred at one corner—Thorin's map of the Lonely Mountain—and a smile crosses his face. Amused, Gandalf watches as Bilbo tries to hide, his fingers gripping an unseen object in his waistcoat pocket.\n\nSitting on the Bag End porch, Gandalf and Bilbo overlook the final preparations on the Party field below. Bilbo blows a perfect smoke ring, watching it ascend, only to be pierced by a tiny sailing ship with masts and sails. As glowing flowers rain down from the branches, evaporating just above the delighted faces of 144 Hobbits, the party is in full swing with feasting and drinking. Carts of beer and wine are scattered about, and tables are laden with steaming scones and savories. Bilbo greets his visitors, while Frodo and Sam sit at a table, drinking ale. Frodo notices Sam's gaze often straying towards the pretty Hobbit, Rosie Cotton, sitting some distance away. As Sam goes to drain his glass, it is suddenly snatched from his hands by Frodo, who thrusts Sam into a passing throng of dancers, sweeping him away. Frodo laughs and finishes Sam's beer.\n\nThe party continues with Gandalf setting alight a spectacular firework that elicits gasps of admiration from the guests. Bilbo entertains a group of young Hobbit children with tales of his adventures, their faces upturned in awe, their eyes growing larger with each astonishing feat, met with stunned gasps from his young audience. Meanwhile, Merry and Pippin, two mischievous young Hobbits in their late teens, cause a stir. Pippin scrambles onto the back of Gandalf's wagon and snatches a small firework. As Gandalf hurries about, lighting fireworks with a blue spark dancing magically from his staff, large hands suddenly clamp down on Merry and Pippin's ears, with Gandalf looking down sternly.\n\nLater, the scene shifts to Merry and Pippin leaning over a barrel, washing dishes in soapy water, while Gandalf sits nearby, smoking his pipe and sipping an ale. Bilbo steps onto a stool, bows in gratitude at the applause from the crowd, and as Frodo and Gandalf smile to themselves, Bilbo's hand pulls something from his waistcoat pocket, holding it behind his back. A strange hum seems to fill Bilbo's head as he gives Gandalf a significant look and nods toward the mantelpiece.",
    "330": "Gandalf's presence expands, his stature rising to its full height as his eyes gleam intensely, casting a shadow that seems to engulf the entire room. Meanwhile, Bilbo, shouldering his knapsack, makes his way to the front door. He retrieves the ring, gazing at it intently as it rests in his palm. With a tremendous effort of willpower, he allows the ring to slip from his hand, falling with a profound thud onto the wooden floor. Shaken and weakened by the separation from the ring, Bilbo staggers out of Bag End, bracing himself against the cool night air, his complexion pale and his body trembling.\n\nGandalf approaches from behind, his attention drawn to the ring which now glints ominously on the floor. He circles it, his expression one of puzzlement, before slowly reaching out to grasp it. Later, Gandalf sits before a roaring fire, pipe in hand, his gaze lost in the dance of the flames. Suddenly, Frodo bursts into Bag End, halting to retrieve the ring that lies at his feet. Gandalf remains fixated on the fire, deep in thought, until he turns, his eyes locking onto the ring now held between Frodo's fingers.\n\nGandalf extends an envelope toward Frodo, into which Frodo drops the ring. Gandalf then seals the envelope with wax and hands it to Frodo. Already at the door, Gandalf turns to Frodo before hurrying out, leaving Frodo alone in the quiet of Bag End. The camera zooms in as the hum of the ring grows louder on the soundtrack, eventually penetrating through the white paper of the envelope to reveal the ring itself, accompanied by the faint, chilling murmur of Black Speech.\n\nIn another scene, the ominous reconstruction of the massive Dark Tower of Barad-dûr is underway, with thousands of orcs swarming its surface, dragging stone and iron to towering heights against a sky smeared with red streaks, casting a dark pall over the nightmarish landscape. Suddenly, nine Black Riders explode from Minas Morgul, charging directly toward the camera.\n\nA solitary horseman races to the top of a hill along the west road, pausing to gaze toward the jagged mountains of Mordor across the main highway south to Minas Tirith. His expression grave, he spurs his horse onward, descending into the lower depths of the Citadel. Inside, Gandalf is seen frantically flipping through ancient scrolls and books on a high wooden table until his eyes fix on a particular old parchment, which he reads aloud to himself in a hurried murmur.\n\nElsewhere, Farmer Maggot is busy chopping wood in his garden when the snorting nostrils of a horse are seen, casting a looming shadow over a Hobbit House. Terrified, Farmer Maggot cowers in his doorway while his dog, Fang, whimpers and backs away. The Black Rider then gallops away at speed.\n\nBack at Bag End, Frodo bids farewell to Sam outside the entrance and heads toward the front door. Inside, a creepy point of view shot captures Frodo approaching up the path. Upon entering Bag End, Frodo pauses, immediately sensing that something is amiss.",
    "335": "Saruman gazes into the Palantir, his hands gently cupping the ominous, massive eye that pulses within. Seated, he watches as his ORC OVERSEER approaches him, the overseer's heavy footsteps echoing in the vast chamber. Meanwhile, Gandalf lies unconscious on the cold, unforgiving obsidian floor of Orthanc's summit, where he eventually stands, the camera pulling back to reveal his isolation atop the towering structure. Surrounded by sheer drops of 500 feet on all sides, Gandalf finds himself marooned on the tiny, flat peak. A haunting wail slices through the air, adding to the eerie atmosphere.\n\nPeering anxiously over the edge, Gandalf's eyes catch the distressing sight below: ORCS are viciously uprooting one of the beautiful Isengard trees. He watches in horror as they hack at the trunk with axes, the destruction spreading as more and more trees are felled, leaving Gandalf in helpless despair. Meanwhile, in the rain-drenched night, Saruman stands looking into the darkness, the ORC overseer sidling up to him, axe in hand, his face dripping with sweat from exertion.\n\nElsewhere, the hobbits, led by Strider, journey through the rugged countryside. Strider halts before a distant hill crowned with an ancient ruin. Frodo, Merry, and Pippin, exhausted and covered in mud, collapse into a small hollow halfway up Weathertop. Strider then drops four small swords at their feet. As Frodo's eyes flicker open, he suddenly sits up, sniffing the air suspiciously. Nearby, Sam, Merry, and Pippin huddle around a small fire, where sausages and bacon sizzle invitingly in a hot frying pan.\n\nTheir peace is shattered as five Ringwraiths on foot race up the steep slope with unnatural speed. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin desperately clamber towards the summit, clutching their newly acquired swords. They race into a ring of broken stones at the top of Weathertop, the remnants of an ancient tower's base. Standing back-to-back at the center of this ring, they brace themselves for the impending attack.\n\nThe Ringwraiths emerge one by one, their gleaming swords brandished menacingly as they slowly advance on the hobbits. At the center of the menacing group stands their leader, the Witch King. In a bold move, Sam rushes forward with a cry, swinging his sword at the Witch King. However, the Witch King easily blocks the blow, and Sam's blade shatters upon impact. The Witch King then lashes out with a powerful fist, sending Sam flying backward.\n\nOvercome with terror, Merry and Pippin throw themselves flat on the ground. Amidst the chaos, Frodo, in slow motion, reaches into his pocket and pulls out the ring. The Ringwraiths close in on him, a venomous whisper echoing in his head as they utter a chilling screech of excitement. Unable to resist any longer, Frodo falls to his knees and slips on the ring, disappearing from view.\n\nTransported to a weird twilight world, Frodo looks upon the Ringwraiths now revealed in their true, terrifying form: five ghouls clad in long grey robes, their white hair and pallid, ruthless faces chilling to behold. The Witch King extends a haggard hand towards Frodo, reaching greedily for the ring on his finger.",
    "341": "In a gripping confrontation, Legolas launches an arrow at the King of the Dead, which astonishingly passes straight through him. Unfazed, Aragorn continues his advance, his gaze fixed intently on the spectre. The King of the Dead, with a menacing snarl, raises his deadly sword above Aragorn's head. With a terrifying shriek, he sweeps his sword towards Aragorn, who, in slow motion, counters by raising his sword, Anduril. The blade of Anduril clashes against the spectral sword, creating a sharp metallic ring that echoes through the caverns. The King of the Dead, staring in disbelief, is then grabbed by the neck by Aragorn, who presses the sharp blade against the ghost's throat before releasing him. Ghostly faces with hollow eyes watch Aragorn closely.\n\nMeanwhile, thousands of orcs relentlessly advance towards the walls of Minas Tirith. A guard atop the parapet shouts down as the huge gate swings open, revealing Faramir's badly wounded horse dragging him, both impaled by orc arrows. Iorlas and other soldiers rush to the Citadel with Faramir's unconscious body on a stretcher, followed by a devastated Pippin. Denethor emerges from the Tower Hall, approaching his son's stretcher with a heavy heart, but soon turns away in shock as he reaches the courtyard's edge.\n\nFrom the top of Minas Tirith, a full view of the orc army sprawls across the Pelennor Fields, resembling a sea of black ants numbering 75,000. Trolls load catapults with rocks, while battering rams and siege towers are pulled forward on chains under the murky twilight of Mordor, illuminated by thousands of flickering torches that give the army the appearance of a moving city. Amidst this, a huge boulder crashes into the walls of Minas Tirith, sending boulders hurtling from catapults across the fields. One boulder strikes a balcony crowded with civilians, causing confusion and panic among the soldiers.\n\nHorror fills the streets of Minas Tirith as the severed heads of Faramir's horsemen land among the soldiers. Pippin, overwhelmed, runs to Faramir, bending over him. As Denethor looks down at his unconscious son, he is suddenly struck from behind by Gandalf's staff. Gandalf, with grim determination, clubs Denethor to the ground before turning to address the soldiers. He then gallops down the winding, labyrinthine streets on Shadowfax against the flow of fleeing soldiers, eventually bounding up stairs onto the level one battlements.",
    "343": "The fate of their quest hinges on Frodo entering the ominous tunnel. As he peers into its engulfing darkness, Frodo is joined by Gollum, whose sparse, greasy hair dangles over his hooded eyes like malevolent weeds. Taking a deep, resolute breath, Frodo follows Gollum deeper into the shadowy passage. They press forward into the dark, with Frodo navigating by the sound of Gollum's scurrying and voice. Overwhelmed by exhaustion, Frodo struggles to keep Gollum in sight amidst the murky gloom. Attempting to follow the voice, Frodo slips, reaching out to steady himself on the tunnel wall. He quickly pulls his hand back, finding strands of white thread stuck to it. Gollum remains out of sight as Frodo, breathing heavily, moves past creatures ensnared in sinister web-like material. The sound of a creaking jointed creature moving purposefully through the darkness adds to the tension. In a moment of blind panic, Frodo starts to run.\n\nMeanwhile, Sam descends the ancient stairs recklessly, his face drained and devastated. His foot slips, and suddenly he finds himself sliding uncontrollably, only halted by a large rock that prevents a fatal plunge over a precipice. Something catches Sam's eye, and he stares, scarcely breathing, at a package of lembas bread. Glancing back up the long, steep stair, Sam sees Frodo running blindly. Frodo falls, entangled in a sticky substance that clings to him. As he lies immobilized on the cold ground, a distant memory in the form of a voice reaches him. In his rising fear, Frodo fumbles in his jacket and pulls out the glass phial, a gift from Galadriel, which he holds aloft. On the other side of the web, Gollum watches. Frodo wildly slashes with Sting, the shining blade cutting through the fibrous strands. The web snaps back into his face as he works to free himself. The tunnel, now lit by the light of Galadriel, reveals the looming shadow of Shelob advancing. As disbelief turns to fear at the sight of the approaching Shelob, Gollum bolts. Frodo hacks at the web and with a desperate lunge, frees himself, though Sting remains caught. Leaving the sword behind, Frodo throws himself through a narrow crevice and stumbles out of Shelob's lair, tumbling onto cold rock. Covered in cobwebs, wild-eyed and drenched in sweat, Frodo looks up just as Gollum lunges at him. They fight, rolling on the ground toward the edge of a precipice. Frodo pins Gollum down, his hands tightening around his throat. Suddenly, a moment of self-realization hits Frodo, and horrified at his own violence, he releases Gollum.",
    "344": "Gollum recoils fearfully. Coughing and spluttering follow. Frodo, shocked, gazes at Smeagol before rising to his feet. Smeagol, in disbelief, fixes his eyes on Frodo. Enraged, Smeagol lunges at Frodo, who falls perilously near the precipice's edge. Gollum stumbles over Frodo and plunges into the ravine below. Exhausted, Frodo stumbles down the steep stairs of Cirith Ungol, filled with remorse over his treatment of Sam. He collapses to his knees.\n\nFrodo lands on soft, green grass. Sun-drenched images of trees appear, followed by a hazy vision of Lothlorien where Galadriel approaches barefoot. She leans down, offering her hand to Frodo, who stares at her for a moment, torn between continuing his journey and succumbing to rest. Understanding his duty, Frodo rises to his feet, soon finding himself back in the dark, fetid tunnels of the Pass of Cirith Ungol. Despite the challenge, he presses on.\n\nFlaming missiles descend upon the city. Grond thumps against the Minas Tirith gate, sending vibrations throughout. Gandalf, mounted on Shadowfax, leads several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers down the streets. Pippin watches as Faramir's unconscious body, carried on a stretcher by Denethor's servants led by Denethor himself, moves with a funeral-like atmosphere. An iron door creaks open, and Faramir's procession enters a wide, vaulted chamber where lantern light casts great shadows on shrouded walls, revealing rows upon rows of marble tombs, each bearing a stone-carved sleeping figure with folded hands. Denethor turns to his servants. The gate shatters under Grond's force; behind it, fearful Gondorian foot soldiers stand. Gandalf rallies the bowmen before the great doors, their courage faltering with each crashing sound. Suddenly, the fearsome head of Grond protrudes into Minas Tirith. Moments later, the gate is demolished, and giant cave trolls invade the first circle under an archway never before breached by an enemy. Rows of archers release a volley of arrows, but the trolls continue to smash the foot soldiers with their giant clubs. Orcs swarm through the opening, igniting a fierce, hand-to-hand battle that spreads into flames and smoldering, blackened buildings. With a roar, Gandalf, on Shadowfax, leads a counterattack followed by several hundred Gondorian foot soldiers. Thousands of Orcs flood through the city gates, breaching the first level.\n\nFrodo, weighed down by the Ring around his neck, staggers through the Pass of Cirith Ungol. Driven by grim resolve, he moves forward, beginning to climb a stone staircase through a narrow pass.",
    "345": "As Frodo Baggins treks through a daunting pass flanked by towering peaks that seem to prop up the sky, he nears the ominous summit of Cirith Ungol. A menacing orc watch tower looms ahead, emitting a faint glow from within its stone structure. The path leading over the summit lies completely exposed to the watchful eyes of the orcs stationed there.\n\nStaying close to the rock wall and shrouded in shadows, Frodo cautiously advances. Unbeknownst to him, the monstrous spider Shelob emerges silently behind him. With stealth and malevolence, she trails Frodo as he ascends the stone stairs, his focus intensely fixed on the orc tower.\n\nSuddenly, Shelob's movement shifts to a horrifying scuttle down the sheer rock face. Frodo senses the lurking menace just in time to spin around, but before he can defend himself, Shelob viciously stabs him in the neck with her stinger. Frodo's body goes limp immediately. As he collapses, Shelob's legs catch him and she swiftly begins to weave cobwebs around him. With incredible dexterity, she rolls Frodo over and over in her legs, encasing him in a web cocoon from head to toe.\n\nJust then, the sharp edge of a sword flashes into view. Samwise Gamgee confronts the giant spider, wielding the sword Sting in one hand and a shining phial in the other. Shelob hisses at Sam, dropping Frodo who then rolls down the stairs within his web prison. With a fierce determination igniting his usually gentle eyes, Sam advances and swings Sting upwards, slashing at Shelob. As she hisses and rears above him, venom dripping from her stinger, Sam ducks beneath her legs and stabs Sting into one of her eye clusters. Shelob screams, her mandibles thrashing wildly as green ooze trickles from her wounded eye.\n\nIn retaliation, Shelob uses her hind legs to lift Sam off the ground and hurl him backwards. Sam lands heavily on the ground, and Shelob pounces, raising her massive belly high above him. As she prepares to crush him under her weight, Sam lifts the elven blade above his head with both hands. The blade plunges into Shelob's soft underbelly, causing a shudder to ripple through her body. Writhing and trembling, she pulls away from the pain and crawls towards her hole, leaving a trail of green-yellow slime behind her. She squeezes into the hole and disappears, her sounds of misery fading into silence.\n\nSam rushes to Frodo's side, tearing away the cobwebs from his head. Frodo's face is deathly pale, his head lolling lifelessly in Sam's arms. Overcome with emotion, Sam lays his face on Frodo's chest, weeping softly. Looking up, Sam notices the orc tower and sees Sting glowing blue—a warning of approaching enemies. A small party of orcs and Uruk-hai, led by Shagrat and Gorbag respectively, begins to descend the stairs from the watch tower. Sam must now make a critical decision as the enemies draw near.",
    "348": "The initial volley of arrows strikes the Rohan soldiers as they continue their charge. Gandalf, atop Shadowfax, swiftly turns around and pulls Pippin onto the horse with him. The Rohan forces are effectively decimating their enemies during this charge.\n\nIn a disturbing scene, Denethor stands on a table over Faramir, dousing himself with oil that cascades through his hair, down his face, and onto his robes. Faramir, struggling through his delirium, opens his eyes just as oil splashes onto his chest. Around them, bundles of oil-soaked wood are stacked, and servants stand by, holding flaming torches, waiting for Denethor's signal. With a nod from Denethor, these servants move closer to the pyre, torches in hand.\n\nAt that critical moment, Gandalf and Pippin, riding Shadowfax, burst into the Harrows. The servants, intimidated, retreat from the pyre. In a sudden act of madness, Denethor grabs a flaming torch and hurls it onto the pyre, igniting it instantly. Gandalf gallops towards the pyre, knocking Denethor down. Pippin leaps from Shadowfax onto the burning pyre and, with desperate strength, pushes Faramir off, sending them tumbling down the bundles of wood to the floor below. Pippin quickly douses the flames on Faramir's clothing.\n\nEnraged, Denethor leaps across the pyre, attacking Pippin and pulling him away from Faramir. Fire rapidly spreads up Denethor's oil-soaked back. As he struggles with Pippin, Shadowfax rears up, striking Denethor and causing him to fall back onto the pyre. In a fleeting moment of clarity, Denethor looks into his son's eyes before flames engulf him. Suddenly, he leaps off the pyre, now a screaming ball of flame, and dashes out of the chamber, across the White Court of Minas Tirith, and plunges over a 700-foot sheer drop into the flaming city below.\n\nSimultaneously, the Rohirrim gain the upper hand, slaughtering vast numbers of Orcs, many of whom are fleeing. Theoden, proud in his saddle, rallies his troops with a yell, but his expression shifts from joy to horror as he sees massive, elephant-like Mumakil approaching, each carrying a war-tower filled with Haradrim archers. Theoden circles amongst his men on horseback, trying to rally them as the battlefield descends into chaos with the Mumakil decimating the valiant Rohirrim.\n\nAmid the chaos, Gandalf and Pippin share a moment. Gandalf looks at the small hobbit, and Pippin, full of fear, looks up at him questioningly. Gandalf, lost in thought, breaks off their gaze as Pippin continues to stare up at the old wizard's softened, peaceful face. Their moment is interrupted as the wooden doors shudder under another blow.\n\nIn the midst of the battle's turmoil, Theoden attempts to rally his men amidst the cries of men and horses. Suddenly, the Witch-king swoops down on his Nazgul, snatching Theoden and his horse into the air.",
    "352": "In the vast expanse of Mordor, the attention of a group is drawn to the plain below, where thousands of orcs are seen marching away from Mount Doom. Meanwhile, 40 miles away, Mount Doom itself emerges dramatically from the plain, its base enveloped in ashen ruin and its towering cone shrouded in cloud.\n\nSimultaneously, Frodo and Sam navigate a nightmarish terrain of volcanic rock and steaming fissures. As they struggle, Aragorn leads a force of 500 towards the imposing Black Gates of Mordor, positioning his troops strategically a half-mile away.\n\nFrodo, weary and dehydrated, leans against a rock and attempts to drink from his water bottle, only to find it empty. Sam, always supportive, offers Frodo a small sip from his own bottle. Their eyes meet, acknowledging the daunting journey ahead. Sam helps Frodo to his feet, and they continue their painful trek across the tortured landscape, no longer wearing their orc armor. Frodo moves with difficulty, half-bowed and stumbling as if blind to the path, his right hand clutching his chest as if supporting a heavy weight, while his left hand occasionally rises to ward off unseen threats. Sam watches his friend with deep concern etched on his face.\n\nAs they journey, a malevolent voice torments Frodo's mind. Suddenly, Sam looks back just in time to see a ray of red light slicing through the gloom, sweeping over the barren landscape. Reacting quickly, Sam throws himself to the ground, but Frodo, mesmerized, turns toward the light. The red beam hits Frodo like a searchlight, causing him to crumple to the ground. All falls silent.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Black Gates, Aragorn readies his men for confrontation. Gandalf, ever vigilant, nods at Aragorn, signaling readiness. Together with Legolas, Gimli, Eomer, Merry, and Pippin, they gallop toward the gates, stopping just 50 yards from the towering structure. The sound of chanting and clanging armor from thousands behind the gates fills the air, followed by the torturous noise of the massive gates slowly opening. Legolas, Merry, and Eomer observe with growing trepidation.\n\nAs the Eye of Sauron sweeps the plains, Sam rises to his feet. The Black Gates swing open, revealing Sauron's formidable army of 300,000. Aragorn, Gandalf, and their companions retreat to their small army, as the orc masses begin their slow advance. The Eye of Sauron turns its ominous gaze towards them.\n\nBack with Frodo and Sam, Frodo's eyes snap open with a start. Sam crawls to him, and together, they struggle to their feet, continuing their arduous journey. Meanwhile, the massive orc army marches relentlessly towards Aragorn's men, who start to waver as they find themselves encircled by the enemy.",
    "354": "Overwhelmed with relief and joy, Sam can hardly believe his fortune. Suddenly, out of nowhere, Smeagol collides into them, forcefully knocking Sam and Frodo to the ground. Smeagol then pounces on Frodo, his fingers tightly wrapping around Frodo’s throat and violently snapping his neck from side to side. Frodo struggles desperately to pry the bony, white fingers from his neck, but Smeagol's grip remains unyieldingly strong, tightening and squeezing the life out of him. In a swift action, a rock strikes the side of Smeagol's head, and Sam leaps onto a stunned Smeagol.\n\nAmidst this, a fierce battle rages on between men and orcs. From high above Mordor, the Nazgul dive into the fray. The long-standing hatred between Sam and Smeagol erupts as they engage in combat. Sam is forced back, with Smeagol biting at him viciously. Using his feet, Sam manages to push Smeagol away and rolls to his knees just as Smeagol charges at him again. In a desperate move, Sam slashes out with Sting, slicing Smeagol across the stomach, causing him to stagger back in agony and scream in pain. Amidst the chaos, Sam frantically searches for Frodo.\n\nAbove, the eagles engage the Nazgul in battle. Gasping for breath, his lungs on the verge of exploding, Sam races up the slopes of Mount Doom in a frantic search for Frodo. Upon reaching the stone doorway of Sammath Naur, he staggers into the mountain, flinching from the fierce heat blasting down the tunnel. Driven by urgency, Sam lurches forward towards an orange glow deep within the heart of the mountain, where the heat is nearly unbearable.\n\nThere, Sam spots Frodo standing tense and still at the edge of the Crack of Doom, a deep, lava-filled chasm located in the heart of ancient Sauron’s forges, the most renowned in Middle-earth. The raging orange glare from the chasm casts Frodo as a black silhouette. Holding the Ring in his hand, Frodo raises it over the bubbling lava below, a strange expression on his face. The hum of the Ring grows increasingly louder, and as it pulls him closer to his body, Frodo turns to Sam. The Ring's influence is complete as Frodo, looking at Sam, puts it on and vanishes.\n\nWith a storm of wings, the Nazgul wheel around and hurtle towards Mount Doom. In the midst of the ongoing battle, Gandalf realizes that Frodo has been seen. Footprints move across the ash-covered cavern. Suddenly, Gollum smashes a rock down on Sam’s head, knocking him to the ground. Gollum then leaps onto the invisible Frodo, frantically clawing at him while riding on his back. Close by, Aragorn turns and faces an armoured troll wielding an enormous mallet. In a surprising move, Gollum lifts his hands to his face and bites down.",
    "356": "The Nazgul screech in agony as they plummet from the sky, engulfed in flames, causing the earth to tremble so intensely that Frodo and Sam struggle to remain upright. Frodo falters and stumbles, but Sam quickly assists him to his feet. A smile graces Frodo's face, and Sam gazes down at him, observing Frodo's peaceful expression, relieved now that his burden has been destroyed.\n\nAs lava surges towards them, Frodo and Sam scramble onto a rock, which rapidly becomes an island amidst a sea of molten lava. Frodo closes his eyes momentarily before glancing at Sam, who is overcome with tears. Frodo wraps an arm around Sam's shoulder, the two tiny hobbits poised to face their end in the midst of a cataclysmic landscape. Lava erupts around them, and fireballs streak down from the sky. The scene gradually fades to black.\n\nSuddenly, Gwaihir, the Great Eagle, soars towards the camera, carrying Gandalf on his back, with two more eagles following closely behind. Amid raining ash and molten rocks, the eagles courageously swoop down to snatch Frodo and Sam from their perilous perch. As Frodo is lifted away from the fiery volcano, the wind tousles his hair, and he slips into unconsciousness.\n\nFrodo's eyes flutter open, slowly scanning his surroundings until they meet Gandalf's smiling face. Laughter fills the air as Merry and Pippin rush in, leaping onto the bed and enveloping Frodo in warm hugs. Gimli and Legolas join them, their joy evident, and Aragorn enters, completing the fellowship. Frodo's gaze eventually settles on a figure standing apart: it is Sam, and their eyes lock in a moment of deep connection.\n\nThe scene transitions to a sweeping view over the walls of Minas Tirith, racing towards the top of the city through a blizzard of white flower petals. The city, now restored, gleams brilliantly in white. The camera soars upward to reveal the Court of the Kings, packed with 4000 people and crowded along the wide path leading to the tower. The Crown of Gondor glints in the brilliant sunlight as Gandalf places it upon Aragorn's head. Aragorn smiles up at Gandalf before rising slowly and turning to face the cheering crowd, who clap and cheer deafeningly for their new king.\n\nAragorn sings for his people before leading a slow procession down the white paved path, the crowd bowing in respect. He passes Eowyn and Faramir, who bow before him, followed by Eomer stepping forward to pay his respects. Trumpets sound, heralding the approach of a procession of Elves, led by Legolas, dressed in shimmering silvers and whites. Legolas gestures behind him, and Aragorn's eyes scan the ranks of Elves, parting to reveal Arwen, her eyes shining with love, now mortal, carrying the standard of Gondor. Aragorn kisses her as Elrond watches with a smile, and they embrace. Together, Aragorn and Arwen walk through the crowd towards four small figures waiting nervously at the end of the path.",
    "361": "In the heart of the great city, Gandalf stands quietly on a balcony, overlooking the sprawling metropolis below. Meanwhile, Pippin gazes in awe at the vast night sky. Gandalf observes the young hobbit, then joins him, their eyes drawn to the distant, jagged mountains of Mordor. Pippin, feeling unnerved, looks up at Gandalf, who responds with a small, self-deprecating smile. Together, they share a silent moment, watching the fiery sky above Mordor.\n\nIn a dramatic shift, giant Mumakil, bearing armies on their backs, march forward, while Corsair ships navigate up the river. Gandalf, now speaking almost to himself with a sense of impending doom, stands in the battle-scarred city of Osgiliath—the last stronghold between Minas Tirith and Mordor. Pippin, desperate for reassurance, looks up at Gandalf, who meets his gaze with silence, his eyes staring into the distance as if envisioning an enemy. In another part of the scene, a towering, hooded figure dressed in black is being armored by orc attendants. Gandalf's focus remains intense, as though confronting this enemy directly. Pippin, too afraid to voice his fears, continues to look up at Gandalf.\n\nElsewhere, Frodo screams as a Morgul blade pierces his shoulder. Pippin, pale at the memory, watches as Frodo and Sam scramble into a small gully beside a rough-hewn road. Gollum cautiously peers over the edge of the gully. The group then faces the sight of Minas Morgul, a massive, dead city perched on a rocky outcrop at the head of the Morgul valley. This corrupt and loathsome place emits a sickly luminous light, reminiscent of a corpse candle. Two huge, bestial stone statues guard the bridge leading to the city. Gollum, Frodo, and Sam hurry from their cover, scampering in the shadows towards Minas Morgul. Gollum glances up at the grotesque statues, while Frodo and Sam, filled with horror, see a narrow, near-vertical staircase cut into the rock-face directly in front of the gates of Minas Morgul.\n\nAs they begin to ascend the stairs, climbing higher and higher up the sheer western side of the Morgul valley towards the high peaks of the razor-like mountains of Mordor, Frodo suddenly staggers across the road, as if driven by a force beyond his own will. He lurches toward the bridge, heading towards Minas Morgul. Sam rushes to Frodo, catching him as he stumbles. Together with Gollum, they pull Frodo from the bridge, and he falls to the ground.\n\nAt that very moment, the ground quivers beneath them, and a great rumbling noise rolls across the landscape, echoing through the mountains. The once cold and dull Morgul valley erupts into violence and fury as flames surge from Mount Doom. In response, Minas Morgul emits a flare of livid lightning, with forks of blue flame shooting up from the tower into the sullen clouds above. Violent, fiery flashes light up the clouds over Mordor, and sharp thunder rolls across forty miles to Minas Tirith.",
    "362": "In a state of terrified wonder, Pippin observes as Sam and Gollum guide Frodo to the stairs. Above Minas Morgul, the sky brightens intensely as the city erupts. Faces of soldiers and civilians in Minas Tirith peer from the city's parapets, witnessing the spectacle. Frodo and Sam collapse to the ground, their hands pressed to their ears, as a rending screech emanates from the city. The sound shivers, escalating to a piercing pitch beyond human hearing. The horrific cry eventually subsides into a long, sickening wail before falling silent. Frodo, overwhelmed, squeezes his eyes shut and clutches his shirt as if it were aflame.\n\nThe cavernous gate of Minas Morgul swings open, and a vast army marches out. Rank upon rank of armor-clad Orcs move swiftly and silently past Frodo and Sam in an endless stream of ragged columns, numbering 75,000, heading to war just below them. Frodo, Sam, and Gollum ascend the stony stairs, high above the marching army.\n\nMeanwhile, Gandalf, deep in thought and calculating, strides purposefully through the back streets of the city. Pippin struggles to keep up, running to match Gandalf's determined pace. Suddenly, Gandalf halts and looks down at Pippin, then kneels and speaks to him earnestly, his hand on Pippin's shoulder. Gandalf watches as Pippin hurries away.\n\nThe scene shifts to an ancient stone bridge spanning the ruins of East and West Osgiliath, a once mighty Gondorian city. Ithilien Rangers patrol the bridge; West Osgiliath has fallen into disrepair, while East Osgiliath's desolation is stark, held by the forces of Mordor. Beneath the bridge, the camera tracks to the dark waters, capturing stealthy movements. Many boats carrying menacing Orcs quietly navigate down the river, steered by hunched figures using long oars.\n\nFaramir, Captain of Gondor, gives commands to his soldiers. The Ithilien Rangers, weathered, hardened, and professional, take their positions, watchful and ready. As the boats approach, Faramir and his soldiers lie in ambush. When the boats reach the shore, hundreds of Orcs race onto the land. Faramir steps forward, sword drawn, but despite a fierce battle, he cannot halt the Orcs' advance as they cross the wide bridge into West Osgiliath.\n\nThe view shifts dizzyingly to look down on Minas Tirith, a thousand feet below, as Pippin scrambles desperately up the rocky mountainside. He clambers over a rocky ledge and ducks behind a stone wall, panting heavily. Nearby, an ancient stone ledge holds a great pile of firewood, secured in stacked bundles. Below, Gandalf waits tensely.\n\nWith stealth, Pippin pours oil over the wood and ignites it. Within seconds, the great pyre bursts into flames. The guards watch in total surprise as the flames erupt into the twilight sky, marking a significant moment in the unfolding drama.",
    "368": "Young Don Price illuminates Edward with his flashlight, initiating a confrontation. Recollections of Edward consistently outperforming Don in football, baseball, and basketball underline their competitive history. Edward stands shocked, overwhelmed by the situation.\n\nSummoning all his strength, Edward turns away, descending the front steps with determination. Lingering in the doorway, a woman feels a profound sense of remorse for the unfolding events before reluctantly retreating back inside. We follow Edward as he walks away, his eyes beginning to well up with tears. He exits the frame, leaving the sorority house looming in the background. Moments later, Edward re-enters the frame, his gaze fixed on the sorority house. As he shouts, we circle around him, intensifying the scene. From inside, Sandra and her sorority sisters watch through the curtains, intrigued by the commotion.\n\nMeanwhile, in a classroom, an economics professor, dressed in tweed, continues his lecture. Sandra, seated among the students, appears disengaged. The professor activates the overhead projector without a glance, triggering a muffled chuckle from the class, which he remains oblivious to. A nudge from a classmate draws Sandra's attention upwards. The professor eventually notices the writing on the projector.\n\nAs Sandra walks with her books, she shakes her head in disbelief at the ongoing events. Her gaze lifts to the sky where a massive heart, written in the clouds, floats gently in the wind. Prompted by her sisters, a groggy Sandra peers out of the second-story window to see the lawn transformed into a sea of flowers. Edward stands in the midst of this floral expanse. Sandra, a mix of emotions swirling within her—confusion, joy, and fear—walks out to meet him. Unexpectedly, a tear trickles down her cheek.\n\nFrom down the street, the adult Don Price approaches, embodying 230 pounds of athletic prowess, a fan of Skynyrd, and proud of his fraternity affiliations. His anger is palpable. Accompanied by a group of his fraternity brothers, Don confronts Edward, knocking him down with a punch. Edward rises but does not retaliate, only to be struck again by Don. Don remains unfazed and continues his assault, brutally beating Edward.\n\nIn a stark contrast, Don Price, seated on the toilet, struggles to relieve himself while perusing a new issue of Playboy. His effort intensifies as he strains unsuccessfully. Suddenly, he clutches his chest and collapses forward onto the tile, lifeless. The image of Don's deceased face on the tile is mirrored in The Eye.\n\nBack at the confrontation, the beating of Edward persists. Despite the relentless attack, Edward manages to stand, bracing for more blows. Don, poised to strike again, is interrupted when Sandra removes her engagement ring. The action elicits gasps from her sisters and Don's brothers. Don stands frozen, his thoughts in turmoil. Edward, his eyes nearly swollen shut, remains poised for the next hit. Sandra approaches, handing Edward the ring. After a tense moment, Don storms off, leaving Sandra to tend to Edward's battered body, his head resting amidst the daffodils.\n\nAs the music swells to a crescendo, the scene shifts abruptly. Edward, now in a more serene moment, reaches for his glass of water, only to find Josephine has already anticipated his need and holds it out to him.",
    "373": "Young Jenny Hill observes Edward, barefoot, departing from Spectre for the first time. The realization of who this woman is dawns on her. Edward attempts to say something more but is cut short as he closes the door behind him; however, it breaks off in his grasp. Inside, Jenny peers out, her expression a mix of surprise and irritation. Edward tries to reattach the door to its hinges, only for them to snap off. The door frame buckles, causing the entire shack to creak ominously. He then tries to prop the door against the frame, but it continues to slip. After adjusting the door's position, it momentarily holds before collapsing inward, smashing a small table. Karl then exerts pressure against the house's side until the door fits snugly.\n\nWith nails held between his lips, Edward installs new windows himself. The exterior features a white picket fence, charming in every detail. Inside, Edward is seen securing a hat rack to the wall in the foyer while Jenny leans against the doorframe, listening to his tale and watching him with profound affection. Once he finishes his work, Edward removes his hat from a chair and hangs it on the newly installed rack. The moment feels perfect, underscored by a meaningful look exchanged between them. As the last job is completed, Edward's purpose for staying diminishes. Jenny, questioning her own intentions, moves closer to him. Edward remains steadfast, and as Jenny takes his hand to hang his hat on the peg, she nears a kiss. However, Edward gently holds her back, leaving her stunned and humiliated. She pulls away as he starts to leave.\n\nJenny quickly finds a pen and signs the house's deed, handing it to Edward. He thanks her with a look and departs. Edward takes a final glance at the idyllic town before climbing into his car and starting the engine. As the vehicle drives away, the swamp begins to encroach on the house, enveloping it in a dense network of vines and mossy branches. Shoots burst through the planks of the porch, and snakes slither through the emerging marsh as day turns to night.\n\nMeanwhile, Will and Jenny sit at her table with a pitcher of iced tea between them. Will smiles at the mention of a particular term, while Jenny grows more agitated by her silence. Will, sorting through his complex thoughts, turns to see his wife using a payphone. She hangs up after trying to call him. Will half-smiles, realizing the futility of his inquiry about his father's well-being, acknowledging that his father will not be okay. At the hospital, Dr. Bennett smiles while reviewing Edward's chart amid the ambient noises of pagers and doctors. Will half-smiles again as Dr. Bennett pats his shoulder and leaves. The camera lingers on Will and his father for a long time before Will takes out a pen and begins to make a list.",
    "375": "In a captivating introduction, Edward is portrayed not merely as handsome and charming but as a marvel of natural forces, as if the universe conspired to create him. In a sudden motion, Edward plunges his hands into the water, seizing a catfish. He lifts it to his face and stares directly into its eyes. After a moment, the Beast ejects Edward's gold ring from its mouth.\n\nMeanwhile, the sound of rain is interrupted by the ringing of a phone on a chair. The distinct, persistent tone indicates it's not from the U.S., but rather has a European insistence. As the phone continues to ring, a glance around reveals a mostly empty apartment, with only a few half-unpacked boxes scattered about. A cradle remains in its box, unopened. Keys jingle in the lock, and laughter echoes in the hallway before the door swings open, revealing Will, aged 29, struggling with four sacks of groceries, their bottoms disintegrating due to the rain. Josephine, 28, his wife, rushes past him to answer the phone and hands it to him, her face etched with concern. Half-stripped from the wet clothes, Will takes the call, his expression suggesting it won't bring good news. He covers the phone's mouthpiece and looks over at Josephine.\n\nLater, on an airplane, Will occupies a window seat in the coach section with Josephine beside him, applying hand lotion. Hours into the flight, the cabin's lights are dimmed, and most passengers, including Josephine, are asleep. She rests her head on Will's shoulder, her hands nestled under her belly. Will notices a bored boy in the next row, using his hands to cast shadows on the seat back. The child skillfully creates silhouettes of a bird, a monkey, and finally a dog. The camera focuses on these shapes, revealing Edward as the creator of these shadows. Beside him, young Will, aged 6, sits in his pajamas on the floor. Between them is an end table lamp, its shade removed to project large shadows on the wall. Edward glances around to ensure his wife isn't listening, then leans in conspiratorially. Young Will beams, eager to hear the forbidden story. Edward starts recounting, counting names on his fingers as his hand moves through the light.\n\nA flashlight sweeps past them, illuminating the night filled with the sounds of whirring and breathing, alive with energy. The moon hangs low, casting elongated shadows. Five kids walk by in silhouette, four of them holding flashlights, while the fifth stumbles and collides with young Edward, now 10 years old. The camera moves up behind the group to the gates of a mysterious location, finally focusing on the children peering through the gate. Edward turns to look at the eerie house. He hands his flashlight to Zacky and begins to climb the gate. After dropping to the other side, Edward, though scared, continues bravely forward.",
    "377": "Will advances towards the door, his hand gliding along the textured wallpaper. Just before reaching it, he pauses momentarily, catching his breath, before he steps inside. Inside, Edward Bloom, aged 61, rests asleep on the bed. Though not as lively as before, his condition isn't as dire as one might have feared; the illness has progressed rapidly yet left him largely unchanged. The room is starkly devoid of medical equipment—no IVs, no monitors, nothing.\n\nApproaching the bed, Will watches as Edward's eye slowly opens and struggles to focus. Edward attempts to speak but finds no words. His gaze shifts to a pitcher on the nightstand. Will pours water into a glass, assisting Edward in drinking from it, soothing his dry lips. A prolonged, tense moment passes, during which Will nearly speaks but then recalls the can of Ensure. He lifts it up; Edward recoils in response. After a brief pause, Edward rolls his eyes. Will opens the can, locates a straw on the nightstand, and Edward drinks as much as he can tolerate before pushing it away with difficulty swallowing.\n\nEdward chuckles, the laugh quickly turning into a cough that worsens until another sip of water calms it. Taking the partially consumed Ensure, Will rises to leave. At the door, he pauses, smiling at his own jest. Closing the door, Will drinks the remainder of the Ensure, grimacing at the awful taste. As he heads towards the stairs, he passes an open door.\n\nThe camera lingers behind, revealing an eight-year-old Will in bed, his face dotted with chicken pox and smeared with pink calamine lotion. His voice, high and thin, strains as he sings, only for it to crack and drop a half-octave unexpectedly. Edward, embarrassed yet determined, continues singing, trying to match the baritone pitch. He tugs at his collar, then again, his face reddening. As he starts to undo the button, it pops off, followed by two more. One button strikes a chubby woman in the neck. Meanwhile, Edward's pant cuffs gradually rise, an indication of his rapid growth.\n\nIn another scene, young Edward lies in bed, his body supported by a complex system of pulleys and levers. He is surrounded by a dozen encyclopedias, with more scattered on the floor. He ponders over an article, complete with illustrations. The sound of a bat cracking signals a game-winning home run, followed by the crowd's enthusiastic cheers as the batter circles the bases. This moment marks our first significant encounter with grown-up Edward, whom we will follow from the ages of roughly 18 to 30.",
    "378": "Football hero Edward leads his team to a triumphant victory on the field. Amidst the excitement, a pretty girl on the sidelines confesses the name of her secret love, prompting the other girls to squeal in delighted agreement. Don Price, observing from nearby, glowers disapprovingly.\n\nIn a dramatic climax, Edward takes an impossible shot from the other end of the court just as the buzzer sounds. The ball arcs perfectly, securing the win as the crowd erupts in celebration. Amidst the jubilation, Don Price remains aloof, the only teammate not joining the mob around Edward.\n\nLater, Edward heroically rescues a dog from a burning house. The scene shifts abruptly to Don Price, who, frustrated, discards his failed lima bean plants into the trash. Nearby, two farmers shake their heads in disbelief at a massive hole punched through the side of a barn, shaped like a man but too large to be human. A stranger, not fully revealed, is implied to be responsible.\n\nA mob of about 50 people gathers, many armed with shotguns. Among them is Don Price. As agreement ripples through the crowd, attention shifts when a voice speaks up. The crowd parts to reveal Edward Bloom, who stands confidently in the midst. Don Price's expression darkens with a glower.\n\nEdward then ascends a steep hillside, reaching the entrance of a cave. Outside, buzzards fight over the remnants of a giant's feast, including broken barrels and cleaned bones. In a grave tone, Edward calls into the cave, and a thunderous voice responds, the force of which blows Edward's hair back.\n\nAs a rumbling grows, reminiscent of an approaching train, the ground trembles. Edward, prepared for a confrontation, picks up a stone, ready to emulate David against Goliath. From the cave emerges Karl the Giant, larger and more feral than any human, his beard reaching his elbow, his skin scratched and blistered, his clothes ragged and muddy. Karl looms over Edward, casting a shadow that blocks the sun.\n\nEdward throws the stone, which harmlessly bounces off Karl. Contemplating his next move, Edward opts for a non-violent approach. Karl appears confused by Edward's change in tactic. Edward, hands at his sides and eyes closed, braces himself for possible consumption. Karl merely stares, unsure of what to do. After a tense moment, Edward cautiously opens his eyes to find Karl not preparing to eat him but sitting down with a resounding boom, appearing dejected.\n\nIn a bold move, Edward reaches up and shoves his hand into Karl's mouth, only for the giant to spit it back out. This interaction reveals Karl's sad truth: less a monstrous being and more a misunderstood giant man. Edward, showing empathy, sits beside him, marking a moment of connection and understanding between the two.",
    "385": "The movie opens with a sense of discontent as the characters appear deeply unhappy. A woman, identified as teutonically pale with visible birthmarks on her face and arms, and notably braless, converses with Dieter in German. Her camera-side leg, wrapped in a bandage at the foot, is stained with dried rust-colored blood at the tip.\n\nTransitioning to another scene, Walter drives attentively, his eyes fixed on the road, while listening to the Dude speak. The Dude's dialogue is occasionally interrupted by yaps from a dog in the back seat. As their car slows, Walter and the Dude turn their attention outside, following Walter's gaze.\n\nThe vehicle then pulls up the drive, and both Walter and the Dude exit, their eyes fixed on the front lawn in astonishment. They burst through the double doors with a loud bang. Inside, a man in a wheelchair spins around, his wheelchair humming as he moves towards Lebowski. From behind, Walter forcefully lifts the big Lebowski out of his wheelchair by his armpits, shoves him forward, and watches as he collapses to the floor, overcome with tears. Amidst this, the dog continues to yap.\n\nThe scene shifts to Quintana, who is loudly protesting at the edge of a bowling lane, being held back by O'Brien. Walter watches him with a feigned innocence. As O'Brien leads Quintana away, he provocatively makes hip-grinding motions. Both Walter and the Dude observe this, with Walter tilting his head and the Dude peering over his sunglasses.\n\nEmerging from a bowling alley, Walter, Donny, and the Dude each carry their leatherette ball satchels. They are confronted by men in black, who are initially taken aback and then start conversing in German. The men briefly stop their discussion, only to resume shortly after. Walter, ignoring the Dude, addresses the Germans directly.\n\nAs tension rises, Donny becomes visibly frightened. Walter's intense gaze locks onto Dieter's, filled with hatred. Meanwhile, the Dude begins to search through his pocket, and raises his voice as he looks into his wallet, continuing to address the Germans.\n\nThe situation escalates when Dieter, with a metallic ring, draws a gleaming saber. In response, a leatherette satchel is hurled, striking Dieter in the chest and knocking him off his feet. Enraged, Dieter charges forward, but the attacker, caught off guard by Dieter's advance, manages to twist away. Grabbing Dieter's head, he pulls it to his mouth and bites down on Dieter's ear, maintaining his grip as Dieter screams in pain.\n\nSimultaneously, another confrontation unfolds as Franz, wearing squeaky leather pants, unleashes karate kicks at the attacker. The attacker, still biting Dieter's ear, awkwardly circles to evade Franz's attacks. The tension peaks with the sound of tearing as the attacker and Dieter are forcibly separated, the attacker growling and shaking his head with Dieter's ear still in his jaws. Franz continues his aggressive kicks, each accompanied by a loud cry, while the Dude tries to dodge them, arms flailing.\n\nIn the aftermath, the Dude, also out of breath, gets up and jogs over to Donny, who is gasping for air. The Dude then dashes into the bowling lanes. Walter, seeking to comfort Donny, places a reassuring hand on his shoulder.",
    "388": "Quintana's gaze meets Walter's, prompting a sad nod from Walter. Meanwhile, Jesus strolls away from the scene. The camera shifts to reveal the Dude lying prone on a rug, his eyes shut, a Walkman headset on his head. Absently, the Dude licks his lips while a faint rumbling sound, reminiscent of a bowling ball rolling down a lane, emanates from his Walkman. In his outstretched hand, he clutches a cassette case marked \"VENICE.\" The moment the bowling ball strikes the pins, the Dude's eyes snap open to see a blonde woman towering above him. Beside her, a young man in paint-spattered jeans swings something at a carrier, and suddenly, a million stars burst across a dark expanse.\n\nThe Dude finds himself soaring over the city, arms outstretched, the wind rushing through his hair and billowing his bowling shirt. Ahead, the mysterious blonde woman rides away on the Dude's rug, resembling a sheik on a magic carpet, gradually diminishing in size. Looking up, the Dude lazily performs a few crawl strokes until he notices a bowling ball materializing in his hand. His initial bemusement quickly turns to concern about the ball's aerodynamics, but as its weight suddenly becomes apparent, it jerks his arm down and sends him plummeting.\n\nFrom above, we watch the Dude hurtle toward the city, pulled down by the bowling ball. A reverse shot shows him zooming toward us out of the dark sky, eyes wide with terror. Led by the ball, he rushes past the camera, plunging us into darkness. Gradually, dull reflections emerge from the gloom, revealing glints on the surface of an approaching bowling ball. Pulling back, we see that the darkness was inside a ball return, and the gleaming ball is now being expelled upward, about to overtake us.\n\nThe Dude gazes upward at the looming ball, its mass casting a huge shadow across his face. The gleaming ball, marked by three black finger holes, rolls toward us. The largest hole—the thumb hole—passes directly over us, engulfing us once again in black. As the blackness recedes, we find ourselves spinning down a bowling lane, our perspective trapped within the thumb hole of the rolling ball. We see the bowler—the blonde woman—receding, still in her follow-through motion. The floor, ceiling, and the alley with pins at its end spin dizzyingly around us, approaching and receding repeatedly until we collide with the pins, clattering into darkness. The pins spin, strike each other, and fall, their sound emanating from the Dude's now askew Walkman, with one earpiece hanging off.",
    "397": "As Fergus turns, he spots Dil approaching with a bottle in hand. He rushes toward her, and soon they are grappling in the shadowy park. Seizing her arm, Fergus leads Dil up the stairs to her apartment. His eyes fixed on her, he shakes her, his concern escalating to alarm, culminating in a slap to her cheek. Slowly, Dil opens her eyes.\n\nCarrying her inside, Fergus positions Dil against a wall before checking the street through the window. In a gulp, Dil takes a hefty swig from a whiskey bottle, then weakly gestures toward a cabinet visible through the bathroom door. Fergus fetches the pills for her. Dil continues drinking from the bottle, wandering around the room before settling down, her gaze shifting to Fergus. Clutching the bottle between her knees, she stares blankly ahead. As Fergus moves toward the door, Dil rises to her feet, her eyes locked on him. There's an undeniable allure about her that draws Fergus back to her side, where he kisses her gently on the lips.\n\nA photograph with a soldier's smiling face is visible as Dil seems enveloped in a sweet, narcotic haze. Sitting on the bed beside her, Fergus watches as Dil, lying back, strokes his hand. Her voice, dreamy and slurred, accompanies a woozy smile. In her intoxicated state, she attempts a playful slap at Fergus, then raises a shaky hand, pointing at him. Fergus tenderly strokes her cheek as Dil speaks in a slow, sleepy manner before her eyes shut and she drifts into a deep sleep. Fergus gazes down at her almost affectionately, and they rest together on the bed, fully clothed.\n\nUpon waking, Dil quietly moves to Fergus's coat on a chair, searching the pockets until she finds his gun. Meanwhile, Jude is in bed when an alarm sounds, prompting her to turn it off. Dil, now at a drawer, pulls out several silk stockings and meticulously ties them to the corners of the brass bed. Gently, she secures Fergus's feet with the stockings, careful not to disturb his sleep. As she ties the final stocking, Fergus awakens; Dil quickly tightens the silk to secure it, speaking in an unusually quiet tone.\n\nFully dressed, Jude prepares in front of a mirror before retrieving a gun from under her bed and slipping it into her handbag. Back with Fergus, Dil is crouched beside him, his gun in her hand, while he stares at her and struggles against the bindings. Standing, Dil keeps the gun aimed at Fergus. On the street, Jude swiftly enters Maguire's waiting car.\n\nFergus continues to tug at the bindings as the figure of a judge appears in a window.",
    "398": "A silhouette of a woman is visible. Jude and Maguire sit in a parked car across the street, their gaze fixed on a paper seller. Meanwhile, Fergus, bound, struggles fiercely against his restraints. Suddenly, he breaks free and speeds away in a car. Exhausted, Fergus collapses onto a bed. As Maguire's car circles the area once more, Fergus, still on the bed, strains and roars in frustration.\n\nFrom Maguire's perspective, the door of a brothel swings open, and an elderly judge emerges. A car filled with his security men quickly accelerates toward him. In a swift move, someone snatches an item from the woman's pocket. The door is thrown open, and the person dashes across the street. Fergus continues his struggle against the bindings.\n\nThe judge approaches a car where a goon holds the door open for him. Maguire, rushing forward with a gun drawn, is spotted by the goon. As he runs, Maguire fires his weapon. The judge collapses, struck by a bullet. The goon, wounded in the arm, retaliates with an Uzi. Despite being hit, Maguire keeps shooting until he falls dead. Chaos erupts with screams filling the air. Jude, driving the car, hits the accelerator and speeds away.\n\nElsewhere, Dil, dressed in a soldier's cricket attire, resembles a sweet little boy. She approaches Fergus on the bed, pointing a gun at his head. Overwhelmed, she starts to cry and gently places the gun on his chest. She then works to free him from his bindings. Sirens wail as police cars approach. As Dil nearly frees Fergus, their faces close, he strokes her hair while she weeps, the sound of a song playing softly in the background.\n\nJude enters through an open door, her arms extended and holding a gun. Dil, rising from the bed, aims her gun at Jude and fires, hitting her. Jude falls to the floor, writhing in pain. Dil advances, still aiming at Jude, who manages to reach for her gun. Dil fires again, striking Jude in the shoulder, causing her to spin and her gun to fly away. Fergus screams from the bed. As Jude attempts to raise her gun, Dil shoots her multiple times until she collapses, fatally wounded, with blood covering her.\n\nDil then turns her gun on Fergus, squeezing the trigger. However, she halts her action. She looks at a photograph, walks over to it, and sits down in front of it. She then raises the gun to her mouth. Gently, Fergus removes the gun from her mouth and places it on a table. He helps Dil to her feet and leads her out the door. Returning to the room, Fergus passes Jude's body and looks out the window to see Dil staggering down the street, navigating through the gathered crowds.",
    "404": "Returning to the room, she begins to gather her belongings, angrily throwing items onto the floor below: men's clothing, leather trousers, a suitcase, and even a teddy bear. Outside, Fergus observes a man on the street, comically clutching his possessions, a clear image of rejection. Dil, in a fit of rage, grabs a large goldfish bowl and hurls it down, shattering it into pieces on the pavement. The goldfish inside thrash helplessly in the street as, upstairs, Dil forcefully closes the window.\n\nBack inside, Dil hands Fergus a glass, and he moves past a photograph to take a seat, glancing from Dil to the picture before nodding towards it. Dil averts her gaze into her drink, and suddenly, they are locked in an embrace. She stretches her entire body over him, and their passion escalates rapidly and intensely. Above them, the photograph appears to smile. Fergus lifts her dress with his hands, but Dil abruptly pulls away, only to approach him again. She unbuttons his shirt, her lips tracing a path down his chest. Despite Fergus's attempts to pull her closer, Dil's hand presses his head back while she undoes his pants. Her kisses travel down his body to his stomach. Fergus's eyes fix on the picture of Jody, whose gaze seems to pierce through him. Dil then lifts her head to kiss Fergus on the mouth, tears welling in his eyes.\n\nIn a quieter moment, Dil sits in front of the mirror, and Fergus stands behind her, gently brushing the hair from her face. They share a tender embrace before she returns to her seat at the mirror. Fergus leaves, and Dil reapplies her lipstick.\n\nLater, at a bar, a singer in a blue dress performs as Dil and Fergus sit together, sipping cocktails adorned with umbrellas. Dave, wearing a neck brace, approaches them from behind and stands for a moment before stepping back. Fergus takes Dil's arm while the woman sings. Dil presses her cheek close to his, eyeing him sideways, then pulls back to look at him directly before dancing closer. The bar is filled with people singing along to the music, and Col performs on stage. Dave, sitting at the bar, sulks and then angrily slams his drink down before getting up to leave. As the act on stage concludes, Dil pulls Fergus back to the bar. Col, the barman, pours her a drink, smiling as he does so. Fergus takes a sip and grimaces while Dil throws hers back in one gulp. She then takes the bottle, refilling their glasses, and slams back another drink. Fergus sips his, but Dil tilts his glass back, forcing him to swallow it in one.\n\nFinally, as they enter another room, Fergus moves slowly, his eyes drifting from the cricket whites hanging behind a curtain to the photographs displayed around.",
    "406": "Fergus peers through a missing window and spots Dil in the elevator. As Dil passes a gap in the wall, she playfully blows a kiss towards him. Fergus then exits the room and navigates around the scaffolding. Upon seeing Fergus, Dil waves, takes a seat on some nearby bricks, and opens a hamper. Despite himself, Fergus can't help but smile. Dil pours him tea from a thermos she retrieves from the hamper. She then lowers her gaze, prompting Fergus to gently remove her glasses and observe her tear-filled eyes. Suddenly, Fergus rises to his feet. Deveroux, witnessing this, feels an unexpected chill. Fergus looks down at Dil and extends his arm towards her. She gathers her belongings and accepts his gesture, her face blooming into a broad smile. Fergus guides her down the scaffolding ramp, and together they descend from the construction site in the elevator. The lift comes to a jarring stop. Dil leans in and kisses Fergus, who then hears mocking catcalls behind him. As the elevator ascends, taking Fergus back to the site, he watches Dil depart.\n\nOutside a hair salon, Fergus stands as Dil, inside, discards her smock and strides toward him. The other girls in the salon smile warmly. Fergus's gaze shifts between Dil and the approaching girls. Dil takes his arm, and they walk away together. Fergus becomes aware of a car tailing them and turns to check. They arrive at her door just as the car halts. Fergus kisses her, staring at her parted lips as if astonished at his own action. Dil then enters her home.\n\nInside a dimly lit room, Fergus switches on a small desk lamp. A voice breaks the silence, and he spots Jude seated in a shadowy corner, her hair now a deep brown. Fergus, speechless, watches as Jude circles the room. She reclines on the bed next to him, removes a black leather glove, and places her hand on his crotch. Fergus firmly moves her hand away. Jude locks eyes with him intensely. In a swift move, Fergus leaps off the bed. Jude moves her lips close to his, barely touching. In a sudden action, Fergus grabs her hair and pulls her head back. Jude, in response, draws a gun and presses it between his teeth. Fergus locks eyes with her. Quietly, he speaks, and Jude kisses him briefly, the gun still at his temple. After this tense moment, she leaves. Fergus remains standing in the darkness.\n\nLater, Fergus approaches the hair salon, flowers hidden behind his back. He observes from outside. Suddenly, the chair swivels around, revealing Jude instead of Dil. Fergus freezes in place. He sees Jude, her smile radiant, conversing with someone behind him, turning out to be Dil. Jude turns in her chair, her smile directed at something or someone behind Fergus. He turns around to find Jude standing there. Abruptly, Fergus stands, throws some money on the table, seizes Dil's arm, and forcefully escorts her out of the salon.",
    "419": "The game concludes, and Bert is already positioned in the front room, seated at a table with a drink in hand. He observes Eddie as he passes by on his way to the bar. Eddie glances at Bert, who, amused by the interaction, rises from his seat and joins Eddie at the bar. Bert chuckles and gestures to the bartender for another round before starting to leave. Eddie then exits, and the sound of a ship's horn echoes in the distance.\n\nEddie proceeds past the piers and warehouses, making his way to a small waterfront bar named Arthur's Pool Hall. The atmosphere inside Arthur's is oppressive and stifling. A handful of lonely drinkers, likely dock workers, hunch over their beer bottles at the bar. In the back, a pool table stands ready. As Eddie steps inside, he notices two burly men, each holding cue sticks, observing a pale, skinny young man as he aligns himself for a shot. The men exchange assessing glances before the young man successfully makes his shot.\n\nEddie approaches the rack, selecting a cue for himself as one of the other players begins to put away his. The young man then executes his break shot, forcefully sinking the nine ball into the pocket. He looks up at Eddie with a snide grin. The other two men, having lost, stand around silently watching the game. Eddie tosses a coin onto the table and later retrieves it while the young man prepares for another game by racking the balls.\n\nWith his cue chalked and ready, Eddie forcefully breaks, sending the cue ball crashing into the pack. The nine ball drops into the pocket, leaving everyone, especially the young man, in a state of shock. Eddie, now out of control, shoots with the precision and control he had displayed at Ames, completely oblivious to the increasingly hostile stares from the men gathering around the table. He successfully makes a series of challenging shots, including tricky combinations, and concludes with yet another impressive combination shot.\n\nThe young man, visibly nervous, fumbles in his jacket for money. All attention shifts to Eddie. Sensing the imminent outcome, the young man pays up, places his cue on the table, drops the cash, and hastily exits. Another man, Turk, a thick-fleshed individual with an obscene appearance and a mocking smile, steps forward. As Eddie surveys the silent, glaring men surrounding him, his initial fury transforms into fear. He wipes his mouth with his sleeve and attempts to retreat but finds no escape route, prompting a casual move toward the table.\n\nTurk then takes the bills from the table and forcefully stuffs them into Eddie's breast pocket. The situation escalates as the men drag Eddie into the men's room and forcefully push him against the ground-glass partition.",
    "420": "A man's cheek is pressed against the glass, with foggy silhouettes visible behind him. Suddenly, Eddie, his mouth gaping, lets out a blood-curdling scream. He screams once more. Released, his arms go limp, and he collapses to the floor. Meanwhile, the bartender, having turned away from the scene, walks back to the bar in the front room. The ship's horn resounds again, followed by a knock at the door.\n\nIn a darkened room, Sarah, clad in her robe and slip, sits alone, caught in a drunken stupor. She rises to answer the knock, her eyes puffy and her face slick with sweat. Opening the door, she finds him leaning against the wall, his arms folded across his chest, one hand covering the other. Stunned, Sarah moves toward him, enveloping him in a comforting embrace. He begins to cry, and she holds him tightly.\n\nLater, Sarah observes Eddie, his hands now immobilized in plaster casts, struggling to find sleep. He attempts to move his arms, as if to ward off an unseen threat. Sarah approaches him, gently stroking his head.\n\nAt the breakfast table, Sarah pours coffee for Eddie, who tries unsuccessfully to lift the cup to his lips. Frustrated, he drops the cup, the coffee spilling to the floor, and rises from the table. Sarah quietly kneels and meticulously cleans up the mess. Their apartment is now orderly and tidy, and Sarah has regained her sobriety.\n\nSeated at her table, Sarah types while Eddie, standing by the window, awkwardly tries to scratch his back. He moves to the table, using his mouth to extract a cigarette from the pack. His eyes briefly meet hers, a silent request for a match. She lights it for him, and as she does, he steals a glance at the sheet of paper in her typewriter.\n\nEddie begins to struggle with the buttons of his shirt. Sarah quickly rises to assist, but he gently rebuffs her help. She watches him wrestle with the button before he throws his arms up in a gesture of defeat. As Sarah helps him with his shirt, he tenderly takes her face in his hands and kisses her.\n\nEmerging from the apartment doorway, Sarah and Eddie step into a warm and beautiful day. Sarah carries a basket, and Eddie seems genuinely happy to be out with her, momentarily forgetting his casts. They choose a spot overlooking the river, spread out a blanket, and settle down. Eddie reclines on the grass, his gaze fixed on Sarah. Together, they bask in the sunshine, their bodies relaxed and at ease. Eddie's eyes lower as he leans back, simply staring at her.\n\nFinally, Eddie approaches the door to Sarah's apartment, poised to knock.",
    "424": "Bert settles into a chair, beginning his evening in the dimly lit room. Nearby, Findley, with a gleam of mischief in his eyes, dramatically empties a cloth bag onto the table, revealing three billiard balls. Eddie, feeling the pressure, takes his shot. The red ball he strikes bounces off the table's shoulder and delicately nudges the third ball.\n\nAs the game progresses, Findley steps away from the table to the bar, leaving Bert and Eddie to themselves. He gestures towards a statue positioned on a table behind the couch—a figure of Pan, complete with horns piercing through its curly hair and goat legs protruding from its waist. After making his shot, Findley carefully lays his cue on the table and joins the bar.\n\nEddie, now without his coat, nervously rubs his hands together. Feeling the tension, Bert turns away from Eddie, joining Findley at the bar. Eddie stands momentarily helpless before deciding to approach Findley, who is pouring himself a drink. As Eddie reaches into his pocket, he suddenly recalls giving all his money to Sarah. Determined, he rushes up the stairs, bursts into the room, and swiftly bypasses Sarah, who lies on the bed facing away yet awake. He retrieves the money from her purse and leaves, closing the door forcefully behind him. He then leaps down the stairs, taking two steps at a time.\n\nBert watches Eddie with a simmering rage as they prepare to continue their game. As the previous game concludes, Sarah quietly descends the stairs and stands at the rail, listening intently. Bert, casual yet dominant, has his feet propped up on the couch. Eddie turns and spots her, his eyes squeezed shut and fists pressed to his temples in frustration. He moves to the billiard table, visibly shaken. Sarah, feeling defeated, turns and ascends the stairs once more.\n\nThe men return to their game, undeterred. Bert, now deeply satisfied, dons his coat and settles down to observe the ongoing match. Nearby, a visibly shaken Findley sinks into a leather swivel chair. A bucket of iced champagne stands ready on the desk, awaiting consumption. Findley takes a drag from his cigarette, eyeing Bert, who slouches impatiently across from him. Eddie, leaning against a nearby wall, remains silent and morose before eventually moving to leave. Findley and Bert watch him depart.\n\nEddie waits at the bottom of the stairs for Bert, then suddenly exits the house. Bert watches him for a moment before following. Upon entering his suite, Bert removes his overcoat and pauses at the door connecting his room to Sarah's, a hint of hesitation in his movements. He pours a drink, quickly downs it, walks to the door, listens carefully, and then opens it without knocking. There, Sarah sits on the bed, composed and expectant.",
    "425": "In her suite, a drink is clutched in her hand and a suitcase rests beside her on the bed. Bert bursts into the room and confronts her. Sarah's voice remains subdued and controlled throughout their encounter. Towering over her, Bert menacingly pulls a wad of bills from his pocket. He then seizes her, attempting a kiss, but she remains cold and unresponsive in his arms. Frustrated, he releases her, and she slumps back onto the bed. Without a word, he turns and retreats to his room. She pauses briefly before extracting a cigarette from a pack, rising, and following him.\n\nIn the reflection of the bathroom mirror, Bert is seen asleep on his bed, surrounded by disheveled and tossed sheets. Sarah, clad in her slip, enters the bathroom and closes the door behind her.\n\nMeanwhile, Eddie returns, striding through the lobby without acknowledging the nearby uniformed policeman, and stops at the reception desk. The concierge, seemingly dazed, eventually hands him an item. Eddie then hastens toward the elevators.\n\nUpon entering the suite, Eddie notices money scattered on Sarah's bed. He places his cue case down and turns to see a crowd gathered in the next room. Bert, still in bed, is being interrogated by a plainclothesman taking notes. A photographer, positioned by the bathroom, readies his flash camera. Bert's attention shifts when he spots Eddie through the open doorway, but a uniformed policeman prevents Eddie from entering further.\n\nEddie eventually manages to enter and surveys the detectives around Bert's bed. The photographer's flashbulb illuminates the scene as he captures an image of the bathroom. Pushing past the photographer, Eddie is struck by the sight of Sarah's lifeless body laid out on the tiled floor. He kneels beside her, reaching out only to retract his hand in anguish. From behind, Bert appears at the bathroom door. Eddie, eyes tightly shut, writhes in pain as he listens to Bert's words. Abruptly, he launches himself at Bert, clutching his throat and pushing him backward. A policeman intervenes, separating them, though Eddie momentarily breaks free.\n\nIn another scene, Minnesota Fats sits absorbed in his afternoon newspaper. Nearby, Big John practices shots at a pool table. Bert, donning dark glasses, stands by the cashier's cage, rolling dice into a leather shaker. The sound of the dice reverberates through the quiet, dim atmosphere of Ames. Spotting Eddie pushing through the glass doors, Bert tenses and signals his men for protection with a fearful glance. Eddie, with his cue case under his arm, marches directly toward Bert. After a tense moment of staring, Eddie shifts his attention to Minnesota Fats, who stands ready to play. Eddie begins assembling his cue and moves to join Fats at the pool table.",
    "426": "In the bustling pool hall of Ames, the atmosphere is tense as the balls are already set up and ready on the table. Willie efficiently gathers the betting money from the players and flips a coin to decide the first move. Preacher and Big John pull up chairs to join the onlookers around the table, while Bert chooses a seat further away, close to the coat rack. Willie taps Fats on the lapel, signaling it's his turn to break. With a swift motion, Sausage sends the cue ball rolling down the table, initiating the game instantly.\n\nFats executes an impressive break, positioning the cue ball precariously near the far corner pocket. Eddie surveys the arrangement of the balls on the table before setting his cue aside and heading to the washroom. As he sprinkles powder on his hands, he catches a glance from Bert. Quickly returning, Eddie grabs his cue and forcefully banks a shot into the pack of balls. The one ball sinks into a pocket as the others scatter across the table, drawing applause from the gathered crowd.\n\nEddie moves with agility to his next shot, engaging in conversation with Bert as he plays. Meanwhile, Bert and Fats exchange meaningful looks. Eddie continues his game with focus while Fats, waiting for his turn, puffs steadily on his cigarette. Bert shifts uncomfortably in his seat as the sound of pool balls colliding and rolling along the table's track fills the air. Eddie's shot finds its mark, and he casts a significant glance at Fats, who lowers his eyes and continues smoking.\n\nThe balls are re-racked, and Eddie dominates the table, sinking shots effortlessly, some challenging, others straightforward. Bert and Fats share uneasy glances as Eddie moves around the table with the precision of a hawk. Fats, now with his jacket off and tie loosened, takes his turn, chalks his cue, and attempts a difficult shot but misses. Eddie, ignoring Fats, steps up to take his shot under Bert's watchful eye. Eddie's skill is on full display as he quickly and accurately makes all his shots, leaving Fats to watch in a state of despair.\n\nThe clock above the door shows six o'clock as Fats remains seated, a drink in hand. Eddie, with assistance from Preacher, slips into his jacket and thoughtfully unscrews his cue. Bert's bodyguards stand by, ready for action, while Fats listens, his head bowed. Bert halts his men with a simple hand gesture and attempts a friendly smile. Eddie, after storing his cue, locks eyes with Bert before turning his attention to the visibly disheartened Minnesota Fats. Fats looks up at Eddie, who then picks up his cue case and heads towards the door. He pauses momentarily to take in the sight of the now-empty tables before exiting.\n\nAs normalcy returns to Ames, Fats dons his coat while Henry begins sweeping the floor. Bert, resuming his authoritative position, settles back into his chair overlooking the pool hall, sipping his glass of milk.",
    "429": "As the crowd's applause intensifies, the billiard balls roll steadily towards the pockets during a thrilling game at Ames. Eddie, basking in the glory, proudly accepts the cheers from the gathered pool sharks, his face alight with excitement. After a triumphant moment, he slaps the chalk onto the table and settles back into his seat, his spirits high.\n\nMeanwhile, Fats slowly rises from his chair and hands a sum of money over to Charlie. It's nearly four in the morning as Fats, after a brief hesitation, reaches into his pocket to pull out more bills. The anticipation builds as both Fats and Eddie stand, shedding their jackets in preparation for another intense round of play.\n\nIn the back room, Preacher enters, clutching a paper bag filled with bottles to his chest. He approaches a poker table where six men are deeply engaged in their game. He leans in to whisper urgently into the ear of one of the players, Bert Gordon. Bert, appearing as a conservative businessman perhaps out for a casual evening with friends, only distinguished by his dark glasses and his choice of milk over alcohol for his ulcer, nods to Preacher, who then departs. Bert pauses, lost in thought, before standing and taking a sip of his milk.\n\nAround Charlie's seat, a sea of cigarette butts litters the floor. Charlie stubs out yet another cigarette and reaches for a fresh one almost immediately. Nearby, Eddie finishes off his bottle of bourbon and throws a jaunty glance at Bert, who is quietly observing from his chair.\n\nEager to continue, Eddie wriggles out of his seat, driven by the thrill of winning. However, his next shot misses the mark. Bert sighs as another player successfully pots their ball. Fats, meanwhile, opens a new bottle of whiskey as the game relentlessly continues. Shots keep being made, and the hands of the clock on the wall race towards eight in the morning.\n\nThe voice of Sausage breaks the tension, marking the end of a game. Ames, now empty except for the players and the staff, feels quieter, more intense. As Fats leans over to take his shot, Henry pulls down the Venetian blinds, casting the room into a dimmer light. Bert, visibly unnerved by Fats' unsettling demeanor, presses a hand to his temple.\n\nA momentary lull in the game allows Fats and Eddie to exchange cold, hard stares—Fats clutching his glass, Eddie his bottle. Eddie takes another swig of his drink and returns to the game, while Bert hands more money to Charlie. Bert then tucks his billfold back into his coat pocket.\n\nEddie, now visibly tired, rests his hands on the table and looks up at Bert's cool, impassive face. Bert slightly adjusts his position by moving his chair a few inches and sitting back down. Eddie, watching a shot sink into the pocket, heads to the water cooler for a drink. Meanwhile, Fats begins distributing his losses across the table.\n\nEddie then stands in front of Fats and Bert, awaiting a response. The two share a glance but remain silent. There is still no answer, no sign of yielding. Eddie starts to return to his seat but suddenly turns back, his face breaking into a weary, clowning smile.",
    "436": "As Don wipes his hands with the towel extended by the attendant, the latter gazes at Don's lapel with a puzzled expression. Don then tips the attendant with a fifty-cent piece. Although the attendant doesn't understand the jest, he laughs out of habit and opens the door to the bar. Don proceeds slowly from the washroom towards his table but suddenly halts, looking around. He becomes acutely aware that everyone in the room, including the waiter, the head waiter, the piano player, and a couple near the piano, are fixated on him.\n\nM.M.'s escort approaches Don aggressively, grabbing his coat. Don retrieves a bag from beneath his coat and hands it to a woman, only for M.M.'s escort to snatch it away abruptly. In a swift motion, Don presents a bill and pulls out the remaining money from his pocket, which the waiter quickly grabs. By this time, they have maneuvered Don to the door. The headwaiter takes Don's hat from the checkroom girl and places it on Don's head before the bouncer forcefully pulls him out of the door. The bouncer continues to drag Don away from Harry's and Joe's, finally giving him a hard shove down the street.\n\nStopping to lean against an iron railing, Don wipes his face with his hand. He adjusts his hat, glances back to see the doorman and taxi drivers watching him. Overwhelmed by shame, Don turns, tries to straighten himself, and begins his journey home.\n\nThe street, lined with waiting taxis, is brightly illuminated, contrasting sharply with the dimly lit area by the wall brackets. Inside his home, everything remains unchanged: the newspaper, the bottle of milk, and Helen's note. Don laboriously ascends the last few steps, unlocks the door, and enters, leaving the items outside untouched.\n\nOnce inside, Don automatically switches on the corridor light. Overcome by feelings of shame and misery, he stumbles to the living room couch, throws himself onto it, and lies there with his face covered by his arms. Eventually, he wipes away his tears with his sleeve and notices something that captures his attention, eliciting a half-crazed smile. It's the shadow of a bottle he had hidden in the light fixture, projected onto the ceiling. With renewed vigor and nervous laughter, Don rises, positions the coffee table under the light fixture, places a chair on top of it, climbs up, and retrieves the bottle. He then descends, aggressively opening the bottle.\n\nDon slowly opens his eyes, gets up, steadies himself using the bedpost and the door frame, and gradually exits the bedroom.",
    "440": "Don grabs a bottle, his eyes filled with murderous intent. The proprietor, captivated by Don's menacing gaze, hands over the bottle without hesitation. Don accepts it and exits the establishment. Upon entering his disheveled apartment, Don surveys the chaos around him. The glaring electric lights irritate him, prompting him to angrily switch them off. Unaware of his surroundings, he proceeds to his large chair where three empty bottles sit on a nearby small table. Don, extracting the new bottle from his pocket, sinks into the chair and begins to open it. Suddenly, the telephone on the desk behind him rings, but he sweeps it off the desk in frustration. With a steady hand, he pours his glass half full, lifting it to partially hide his face.\n\nIn the darkened room, Don is found unconscious in his chair. Upon waking, he remains in a daze, staring blankly ahead. The bottle beside him is nearly empty. Out of the corner of his eye, he notices a hole in the wall above the couch near the door, caused by a carelessly removed nail. From this hole, a small, friendly mouse emerges. Initially, Don recoils in repulsion, but soon his expression softens, and he offers the mouse a half-smile. At that moment, a strange winged creature, later identified as a bat, flies past Don towards the mouse, circling the room in slow loops. Don, recoiling into his chair, watches in disgust as the bat's wing brushes his forehead during its swift yet fluttering pursuit of the mouse.\n\nThe bat makes another swoop, enveloping the mouse with its wings. Beneath those dark wings, a grim struggle ensues. It appears the bat has captured the mouse in its claws, and a spurt of blood emerges from under the wings. Overwhelmed by horror, Don screams so loudly his throat feels like it's tearing apart, and he buries his face in the back of his chair in sheer terror. It seems Sophie, his dog, has been listening since his initial scream and now barks wildly beside him. The sound of Mrs. Deveridge's dog barking from downstairs adds to the cacophony. The door to Mrs. Deveridge's apartment stands open. Still cowering and breathing heavily with fear, Don hides his face in his arms. From outside, the sound of footsteps hurriedly approaching his door is followed by the doorbell ringing in a short, short, long, short pattern.",
    "435": "Don's gaze drifts towards the window as he observes the world outside. Meanwhile, Don, with his back to Wick, is hunched over a suitcase, diligently packing his belongings. He then moves to the chest of drawers, retrieves additional shirts and socks, and returns to his task.\n\nTensely, Don peers forward, watching as Wick proceeds into the living room. Left to himself, Don moves with remarkable speed. He grabs a sweater, approaches the window, and lifts a whiskey bottle. Carefully, he wraps the sweater around the bottle, ensuring only the top and the string are visible.\n\nDon attempts to loosen the noose around the bottle, but his nervousness causes him to waste a critical second. From the living room, the sounds of Wick opening a closet door and searching through it reach Don's ears. Realizing he cannot free the string in time, Don quickly lowers the bottle back down the wall just as Wick is about to enter the room.\n\nWith an attempt at nonchalance, Don stoops to look under the bed as Wick steps in, holding a stack of white paper. Wick then retrieves a Remington portable typewriter, model 1930, from somewhere in the room and places it into Don's suitcase. As he moves toward the door, the sound of a bell rings out in a pattern: short, short, long, short. From the bedroom, we see Wick open the door.\n\nHelen bursts into the room, breathless and unmistakable in her identity. Upon spotting Don, she hurries to the bedroom. At twenty-six, Helen is a striking figure, with a clean-cut appearance and an attractive demeanor. In her hands, she carries two wrapped books and a small package. Her face radiates a brave, cheerful, and lively charm, enhanced by her choice of a three-quarter-length leopard coat, which seems a bit warm for the mild Indian Summer day, yet she wears it fondly.\n\nHelen places her packages into Don's suitcase, part of an ongoing playful tradition between them. Don bends down slightly, allowing Helen to plant a kiss on his cheek. As their faces come close, a fleeting emotion crosses Don's eyes. At this moment, Wick, who has been smoking throughout the scene, glances up, and a suspicious exchange of looks passes between him and Helen.\n\nWick casually discards his cigarette out the window, but unbeknownst to them, it does not fall out; instead, it ricochets off the opened casement and lands on the sill, smoldering. In a sudden burst of fury, Don reaches into his pocket and pulls out a set of keys. His eyes then catch the sight of the still-smoldering cigarette on the sill.\n\nWick turns away and heads towards the window. Don, held by Helen, watches Wick's movements with intense focus. As Wick flicks the cigarette into the garden and is about to re-enter the room, his attention is drawn to a cleat and a string. He leans out of the window to get a better look.\n\nSensing the tension, Helen shifts her gaze between the two brothers. Don releases Helen and, with panic evident in his eyes, stares at Wick, uncertain of what will happen next.",
    "445": "Don gracefully removes his hat and bows courteously as he passes a group of ladies engrossed in conversation. One of the ladies disapproves with a tsk-tsk. Continuing his stroll, Don feels at ease with the apples he carries. The ladies watch him as he moves on.\n\nUpon reaching the bar, Don settles onto a stool and sets down a paper bag. He extracts bills and change from his pocket, placing them on the counter. Nat, the bartender, pours a drink before resuming his task of squeezing lemons. As Don lifts the glass to his lips, he suddenly becomes acutely aware of the patrons at a nearby table and Nat's observant eyes. His hand freezes mid-motion. Attempting nonchalance, Don places the glass down and adopts the pose of a casual drinker, then pulls out a cigarette, lights it, and drops the match into an ashtray. His gaze inadvertently lands on a jigger of whiskey. After tucking his handkerchief back into his pocket, Don swiftly drinks the contents of the glass in one gulp. Nat, attentive, wipes away the wet ring left by the glass with a bar towel, as Don holds the now-empty jigger.\n\nFrom the background, Gloria rises from her table and heads towards the powder room. As she passes Don, she teasingly runs her finger through the neckline of his hair before continuing on. Don turns his attention back to Nat, gesturing towards the paper bag now revealing the apples inside. With a magician's flair, Don produces two apples from the bag, uncovering the necks of hidden bottles. Nat, intrigued, pulls out one of the bottles. Leaning over the bar, Don points to his empty glass, prompting Nat to pour another drink without changing his expression.\n\nGloria returns from the powder room. As she makes her way back to her gentleman friend at the table, she once again brushes her finger through Don's hair. Just as she's about to pass him, Don catches her hand and pulls her towards him, then releases her to return to her seat. His gaze shifts towards the table where Gloria sits.\n\nThe camera focuses on the wet rings left by Don's glass on the bar. Through quick dissolves, we see the count of rings increase from five to six, and finally to nine. Meanwhile, in another scene, Wick forcefully closes his suitcase, locks it, and carries it into the living room. Helen follows him, watching as Wick sets down the suitcase and retrieves a topcoat from the closet. She turns away, leaning against the wall in an attempt to hide her tears.\n\nBack at the bar, Don, still holding the empty jigger, now leans against the counter. The bar is moderately busy, with eight patrons at the bar and five occupied tables.",
    "447": "In a dimly lit setting, raincoats sway gently. The camera slowly approaches one of them, revealing a bottle of whiskey protruding from a pocket. A man, parched, wipes his mouth and then returns his handkerchief to his pocket. He retrieves a coat check from the same pocket, clenches it tightly, resisting a foolish urge. Rising from his seat, he irritably leaves amidst disapproving murmurs from those seated behind him.\n\nAt the counter, he places the check down. An attendant, previously engrossed in a newspaper, looks up, takes the check, and departs. Meanwhile, Don rolls his program and wedges it into a cuspidor's sand. The attendant returns, now holding a short leopard coat and a lady's small umbrella. Don, visibly nervous, bites his lips, struggling to find another argument. The attendant brusquely shoves the items toward Don, who then hurriedly checks the leopard coat for the concealed bottle before moving away. The attendant retreats to the other end of the counter, resuming his nap.\n\nDon takes his coat and thrusts the leopard coat at Helen, leaving her with it and his bowler hat. Realizing his mistake, Don returns for the hat and departs again. His patience waning, he stops once more, grabs the umbrella, and tosses it towards Helen, who, in the process of donning her coat, fails to catch it. The umbrella falls beside her, leaving Don momentarily embarrassed. He picks it up and they continue their conversation as they exit the cloak room, through the vestibule, and onto the street with Don's coat draped over his arm.\n\nA moment of hesitation grips Don, quickly resolved by his awareness of the bottle in his raincoat. As he prepares to don his raincoat under the marquee, a crash sounds nearby. On the sidewalk, the broken remnants of a pint of whiskey lie scattered. Both Don and Helen pause to look down at the debris. Helen walks away, and Don, after a brief glance at the broken bottle, calls after her with sudden resolve. In the darkening evening, under a light drizzle, Don catches up to Helen, taking the umbrella from her to shield them both as they proceed down the street.\n\nBack at a now-empty venue, only Nat and Don remain. Outside, sunlight streams in. Inside, Nat busily removes chairs from tables and sets up the bar for the afternoon and evening rush, while Don, leaning against the bar with a jigger of whiskey in hand, continues talking and eventually drinks. The scene shifts to a bustling commercial hotel, alive with the routine activities of a hot summer day.",
    "458": "In a gripping scene, a man swiftly extracts a deadly, sharply pointed dagger with a triangular blade and sprints forward. Inigo, in hot pursuit, narrows the distance rapidly, descending stairs into a dining hall. Suddenly, Count Rugen hurls the dagger. Inigo desperately tries to evade it, but the weapon embeds itself deeply into his stomach, propelling him helplessly against the wall, his eyes glazing over as blood seeps from his wound. From across the room, Count Rugen observes Inigo as he slowly sinks down.\n\nMeanwhile, Buttercup quietly shuts the door to the Honeymoon Suite and moves to the far wall. Seating herself at a table, she opens a jeweled box and retrieves a very deadly looking dagger. With a serene demeanor, she presses the blade against her bosom. Suddenly, she whirls around to see Westley lying motionless on the bed, Yellin's sword beside him. Despite his voice sounding normal, he remains still. Buttercup rushes to him, showering him with kisses, while Westley lies helpless. In her fervor, she accidentally lets his head bump against the headboard.\n\nBack in the dining hall, Count Rugen watches with surprise as Inigo, despite his severe injury, feebly pulls the dagger from his stomach and holds the wound with his left hand. Rugen, now advancing with his sword drawn, moves in to finish Inigo off. As the Count nears, he flicks his sword at Inigo's heart, but Inigo manages a weak parry with his six-fingered sword, though Rugen's blade still sinks deeply into Inigo's left shoulder. Undeterred and seemingly numb to the pain, Inigo readies himself as Rugen steps back, preparing to strike at his heart again. Using the wall for support, Inigo struggles to his feet, managing to deflect another thrust, this time taking Rugen's sword through his right arm. Still, Inigo remains unfazed by his injuries.\n\nAs Inigo continues his slow rise, Rugen watches, poised to strike once more. However, Inigo surprises him with a small, unexpected flick of his own, causing Rugen to jump back and emit a surprised cry. Inigo, pushing away from the wall, faces Rugen's sudden, fierce attack. The Count, a master swordsman, unleashes powerful, precise strikes, forcing Inigo back against the wall. Yet, despite the intensity of the assault, none of Rugen's blows manage to penetrate Inigo's defense as the Count momentarily steps back.",
    "461": "The Kid, still pale and weak, grips the sheets tightly with his hands, suggesting a subtle tension beneath his frail appearance. His Grandfather, silent, remains patiently by his side, offering a comforting presence without words.\n\nSuddenly, the scene shifts to a boat where Buttercup treads water. We find ourselves back at the last moment we saw her, frozen in fear as a Shrieking Eel, jaws wide open, is about to attack. In an instant, a Giant Arm smashes the Eel unconscious and effortlessly lifts Buttercup to safety. On the deck of the boat, Fezzik gently places Buttercup down, while Inigo points to something behind them. Meanwhile, Vizzini secures Buttercup's hands with a rope.\n\nAt dawn, the boat is closely pursued by a black sailboat, piloted by the Man in Black, whose vessel seems almost to fly over the water. As the cliffs rise dramatically from the sea, impossibly high, a thrilling chase ensues towards these Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo expertly steers towards the cliffs as the Man in Black closes the gap rapidly, though still trailing due to the initial lead.\n\nFezzik, reaching along the cliff face, grabs a jutting rock and finds a thick rope hidden behind it. Dropping back to the boat, he swings the rope free and it stretches all the way to the top of the cliffs. He then straps a harness to himself, lifting Buttercup and Vizzini into it, before securing himself as well. All three are carried by Fezzik like papooses as he begins the ascent up the rope.\n\nThe Man in Black, from his approaching ship, watches Fezzik ascend with his group through the early morning light. The view from below is dizzying, giving a real sense of vertigo as Fezzik continues his climb. Buttercup, overwhelmed by fear, struggles with her emotions, while Fezzik, determined and strong, has already covered over a third of the ascent.\n\nThe Man in Black leaps from his ship to the rope, starting his own climb with remarkable speed, his hands moving like lightning as he rapidly closes the distance between him and Fezzik's group. Fezzik, feeling the pressure, nods at a prod from Vizzini and increases his pace, though his arms soon begin to move more slowly under the strain.\n\nAs the Man in Black gets within a hundred feet of them, the tension escalates. Vizzini, sensing the imminent threat, leaps off and draws a knife, beginning to cut the rope that is tied around a great rock at the top. Inigo assists Buttercup to her feet while Fezzik, unsure of his next action, waits for instructions.",
    "462": "Amidst ancient stone ruins, reminiscent of a dilapidated fort now akin to Stonehenge, unfolds a gripping tale. The Man In Black, astonishingly agile, scales a sheer cliff, diminishing the distance to the top from 75 feet to perhaps just 50 with every determined move. Meanwhile, Vizzini severs the last of a rope which slithers away like a serpent returning to the sea. Nearby, Fezzik, Inigo, and Buttercup stand by the cliff's edge, witnessing the scene unfold.\n\nThe Man In Black finds himself perilously suspended hundreds of feet above the ground, clinging to the cliff with a desperate grip. Vizzini, visibly shocked, turns to the others, all staring down in awe. Inch by inch, The Man In Black painstakingly ascends, undeterred by the daunting height.\n\nFezzik joins Inigo, exchanging a nod before hurrying after Vizzini. Inigo, restless and tense, remains by the cliff, occasionally glancing down, while practicing his fencing skills with nervous energy. The Man In Black continues his slow climb, gaining just six inches at a time.\n\nAs Inigo steps away, he draws his sword and performs a few flawless thrusts, then eagerly returns to the cliff's edge. Below, The Man In Black pauses, resting and regaining strength. Inigo, intensely focused, raises his right hand, his eyes aflame, his voice resonating with newfound intensity as he speaks.\n\nSuddenly, Inigo dashes to a giant rock where the rope was initially tied, retrieves a small coil of rope, and rushes back to the cliff's edge. He throws the rope down, narrowly within reach of The Man In Black. The climber, momentarily losing his grip, swiftly grabs the rope, hanging in space before looking up at his savior.\n\nWith immense effort, Inigo pulls The Man In Black upward, through the early morning light, until the cliff top is finally within reach. As The Man In Black crawls to safety, he looks up at Inigo, marking the beginning of a significant encounter between these two heroes.",
    "469": "Joseph adorns himself with a chain around his neck, prompting applause from the gathered crowd. As Salieri attempts to kiss his hand, Joseph gently prevents him and moves on. Meanwhile, Cavalieri, beaming with adoration, offers a deep curtsey to Joseph, who then assists her in rising. The crowd surges toward Salieri, expressing their approval through enthusiastic shouts and gestures, all eager to shake his hand amidst tugs and pats. Yet Salieri's focus narrows to finding one specific man; his gaze sweeps the room until he spots Mozart standing quietly. Driven by eagerness, Salieri approaches Mozart with a smile.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts as Mozart and Schikaneder burst into an apartment, their laughter filling the air, accompanied by three actresses. They enter cautiously, with Mozart, still slightly intoxicated, peeking in first to ensure silence. Upon spotting the strangers, Mozart's face breaks into a broad smile, and he swings the door wide for Schikaneder and the girls to join. Mozart's gaze fixates on the stage where the imposing figure of the Commendatore, clad in robes and helmet, extends his arms and points accusatorily. A dramatic scene unfolds as a giant nailed fist smashes through the wall of a painted dining room set. The Commendatore, now a giant armored statue, strides onto the stage, his finger aimed at Don Giovanni seated at the supper table, while his servant Leporello trembles beneath it.\n\nFrom the back of a box, barely visible in the semi-darkness, Salieri watches the unfolding drama. The half-empty theater is a silent testament to the scene's impact. On stage, the Commendatore confronts Giovanni, and the focus shifts back to Salieri, absorbed in the moment. The tension escalates as Don Giovanni is seized by the icy grip of the Statue, and flames erupt from the artificial rocks around them. Demons materialize, dragging the defiant libertine to Hell, a spectacle that leaves Salieri staring, wide-eyed.\n\nThe scene shifts to a more mundane setting where Schikaneder sits at a table, drinking wine. Michael Schlumberg enters from his salon, finding Mozart standing there, looking unwell and bewildered. Panic grips Mozart as he springs up, evidently terrified, and flees to his workroom, slamming the door behind him. Constanze, now slightly alarmed herself, cautiously opens the front door to find Schikaneder, dressed flamboyantly as ever. From the kitchen, Lorl peeks out, observing as Schikaneder, spotting a manuscript on the table, approaches it eagerly and picks up a page without hesitation. The workroom door opens to reveal Mozart, appearing wild-eyed, extremely pale, and strange to Schikaneder. Mozart giggles triumphantly, presenting his head with a bright, yet somewhat demented smile, prompting Schikaneder to suddenly grab his lapels. In another setting, a frightened and tearful Lorl faces Salieri.",
    "468": "A faint light gradually illuminates the screen, revealing an eighteenth-century balustrade and a flight of stone stairs viewed from the landing above. Up these stairs ascends Salieri's VALET, carrying a branched candlestick, accompanied by Salieri's COOK, who holds a large dish of sugared cakes and biscuits. Both men, the thin, middle-aged Valet and the plump Italian Cook, are visibly worried as they climb in their night-dresses, shawls, and clogs, wheezing with each step. Their candles cast shadows onto the peeling, decayed walls of the evidently old house. A cat darts between their bare legs just as they reach the salon door. The Valet attempts to open the door, but both men recoil in horror as it swings open.\n\nInside, they find Old Salieri lying in a pool of blood on the floor, an open razor clutched in his hand. He has attempted to cut his throat but remains alive, gesturing towards them. The servants rush to him, struggling to lift their old Master and staunch the bleeding with a napkin. Amidst their efforts, a glimpse of the room reveals an old chair, tables stacked with books, a forte-piano, and a chamber-pot scattered on the floor.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to a Masquerade Ball, where twenty-five dancing couples, fifty guests, ten servants, and a full orchestra are gathered. The room, crowded with dancers, moves through the slow phase of a dance popular in the early 1820s. As the tempo quickens, the view returns to Old Salieri, now being carried out of his home on a stretcher by two attendants. They load him into a horse-drawn wagon under the watchful eye of a middle-aged doctor sporting a tall hat. The driver cracks his whip, spurring the horse into motion, and the wagon speeds away through the falling snow, racing through the snowy city streets.\n\nInside the wagon, Old Salieri, wrapped in blankets and barely conscious, is supported by hospital attendants under the grim stare of Doctor Gulden. The wagon soon reaches the General Hospital of Vienna. In the hospital's wide, white-washed corridor, Doctor Gulden walks alongside Father VOGLER, the hospital's forty-year-old, self-important Chaplain. As they proceed, they pass several patients in white linen smocks, some showing signs of mental disturbance. Doctor Gulden is dressed in a dark frock-coat, while Vogler wears a cassock.\n\nIn a poignant moment, Old Salieri, now in a wheelchair, propels himself to the forte-piano and begins to play an unrecognizable melody. His enthusiasm grows as he transitions to another tune, pouring his soul into the music.",
    "471": "The captivating soprano KATHERINA CAVALIERI, adorned in a detailed mythological Persian costume, graces the stage at age twenty-four, delivering the final, intricate notes of a florid aria composed by Salieri. The crowd erupts into enthusiastic applause. Amid the celebration, a mischievous note is struck as someone subtly begins playing the opening of Mozart's Eine Kleine Nachtmusik. A priest, witnessing the performance, nods approvingly and hums along, a smile spreading across his face.\n\nThe scene shifts dramatically to a young MOZART, only six years old, blindfolded and perched on a stack of books on a gilded chair, masterfully playing the harpsichord before the POPE and an assembly of CARDINALS and church dignitaries. Nearby, his father LEOPOLD stands, beaming with pride. As the piece concludes, Leopold gently closes the harpsichord and lifts his son onto its lid. The blindfold is removed, revealing Mozart's pale face and intense gaze.\n\nIn another part of the church, a twelve-year-old Salieri sits captivated between his corpulent and serene parents. His father, a heavy-set man exuding self-satisfaction and disinterest in the music, contrasts sharply with the young Salieri, who listens enraptured beneath the stern gaze of Christ on the cross looming over the altar.\n\nThe scene shifts to the Salieri family gathered for dinner. A large cooked fish rests on a thick china plate as the camera pulls back, revealing the family at the table. Father Salieri, positioned at the head, a napkin tucked under his chin, receives a portion of fish from his wife and begins eating greedily. Suddenly, he chokes violently on a fish bone, prompting the women to rush to his aid, their efforts to dislodge the bone proving futile.\n\nA grand room filled with guests sets the stage for the next scene, where Gypsy musicians play softly in the background. A small ensemble of thirteen wind players from the Archbishop's orchestra, dressed in their employer's livery and equipped with 18th-century instruments like bassoons and basset horns, prepare their music at one end of the room.\n\nAmid this opulence, a thirty-one-year-old Salieri, impeccably dressed in black with clean white linen, moves through the crowd. His attention is suddenly captured by a servant carrying a large tray of cakes and pastries. Entranced by these delicacies, Salieri follows the servant out of the Grand Salon and into a buffet room where numerous tables, covered to the floor with cloths, are laden with various plates of confectionery. As the servant sets down the tray and leaves, Salieri, in his own version of paradise, discreetly sneaks in to indulge once the servant is out of sight.",
    "472": "Salieri cautiously steps into the room, his eyes scanning the surroundings. His mouth waters as he beholds a lavish spread of confections. His gaze is particularly drawn to a towering stack of dark chocolate balls sculpted into the form of a pineapple. As he extends his hand to snatch one, a sudden giggle interrupts him, prompting him to swiftly crouch behind the pastry table.\n\nA young woman, Constanze, bursts into the room, dashing across it to conceal herself behind a table. Moments later, silence falls before Mozart, a 26-year-old adorned in a splendid wig and a striking coat bearing the Archbishop of Salzburg’s emblem, rushes in. Puzzled by Constanze's sudden disappearance, he scans the room. Under Salieri's astonished watch, Mozart dives beneath the tablecloth and playfully tackles Constanze.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Grand Salon, the audience is mostly seated, the exotic wind instruments are poised, and all candles are lit. Prince-Archbishop Colloredo, a diminutive yet self-important figure of fifty, clad in a wig and topped with a scarlet skullcap, enters, followed by his Chamberlain, Count Arco. As everyone rises, the Archbishop proceeds to his throne and takes his seat.\n\nUnexpectedly, a wind musician stands, approaches the Chamberlain, and whispers something to him. Back under the table, Mozart and Constanze roll on the floor, their mood softening as she kisses him and they embrace. Suddenly, she slaps him in shock, prompting Mozart to leap up, disheveled and rumpled, before dashing out of the room. Salieri, witnessing this from his hiding spot, is filled with both amazement and disgust.\n\nMozart, hurriedly adjusting his attire, makes his way to the Grand Salon, away from the buffet room. As he enters, bowing to the Archbishop, the guests turn to watch him approach the dais where the wind band is tentatively playing the opening of the Serenade. The conductor relinquishes his position to Mozart, who seamlessly takes over the conduction.\n\nDeeply embarrassed, Constanze sneaks into the room and quietly takes a seat at the back. Salieri, still reeling from his unintended spying, stands at the door, staring in disbelief at Mozart as he conducts the Adagio from his Serenade (K. 361), masterfully guiding the thirteen wind instrumentalists.\n\nThe audience, clearly enchanted, applauds as Mozart, equally delighted, takes a bow. With a mix of fury and grace, he exits the room. Outside the private apartment, a crowd, including Constanze, breaks into sustained applause upon seeing the composer.",
    "481": "Lila spots a narrow alley at the end of a row of cabins and heads towards it. As she advances, she keeps her eyes fixed forward. An old house looms against the skyline, drawing her closer with each step. Purposefully, Lila approaches this house, her gaze lifting to take in its full structure. She halts at the porch, her attention riveted on the house before turning back to face it squarely.\n\nThe camera follows her ascent up the steps to the porch. Lila's hand reaches out, pushing the door open to reveal the hallway beyond. She steps inside past the camera, gently closing the door behind her. She lingers there, enveloped in silence, listening intently.\n\nMeanwhile, in another part of the house, Norman stands motionless behind a counter, his gaze fixed on Sam, who lounges comfortably on a small sofa.\n\nLila, now halfway up the stairs, pauses briefly at the top. The camera, stationed at the base of the stairs, tilts upward, tracking her climb. To her right, the door to the mother's room remains shut. After a moment of silence, it begins to creak open, revealing Lila standing hesitantly on the threshold. She is instantly disturbed by the room's eerie atmosphere, a chill running through her, prompting an urge to shut the door and flee.\n\nDespite her discomfort, she steps inside, leaving the door ajar. The room is furnished with a four-poster bed lacking a canopy, a satin-draped dressing table, a large chiffonier, a wardrobe with spacious doors, an oval full-length mirror opposite the door, a satin recamier, an upholstered armchair near the window, and a white marble fireplace with a cold grate filled with ashes.\n\nLila's gaze drifts to the bed before she moves to the dressing table. Catching her reflection in the pier-glass, she startles, then turns away and approaches the chiffonier. As she reaches for a drawer, her eyes catch sight of the high wardrobe. With hesitation, she walks over and opens one of its doors. Inside hang freshly pressed, clean dresses arranged neatly.\n\nExiting the mother's room, Lila closes the door behind her and crosses the hall to another room with a partially open door. She pauses at the entrance, reaches inside to flick on the light switch.\n\nSimultaneously, Sam stands up from the sofa and moves to the counter, his gaze briefly shifting to glance out the window at the old house.\n\nLila enters the new room and approaches a chair, her hand reaching out to touch it. The contact disturbs a figure seated there, causing it to turn slowly and stiffly in a clockwise motion. Lila watches in horror as it reveals itself to be the body of a woman, long deceased.",
    "486": "Norman gazes at a picture mounted on the distant wall he leans against. He extends his arm, touches the frame, and hesitantly removes the small picture from its hook. As he does so, a small beam of light from a hole behind the picture illuminates his face. The room's dimness accentuates the light on Norman's face. The camera moves in, zooming so close that Norman's profile dominates the screen. The pinpoint of light strikes his eye, and through the tiny aperture, Norman peers into Mary's cabin. He watches as Mary begins to undress, already in her bra and half-slip. She bends slightly, reaches behind her upper back, and starts to unclasp her bra. Norman's eye traces the contours of Mary's unseen form as she slips into a robe, concealing her nudity.\n\nTurning away from the peephole, Norman faces the camera briefly before shifting his gaze to the parlor window. With quick, precise movements, he rehangs the picture over the hole and exits the parlor, passing through the office and onto the porch without closing the door. He strides along the porch toward the main house. On the path, he pauses, looks up at the bedroom window's light, then straightens his posture and confidently walks up the path. Entering the house, he pauses at the staircase's base, looking up at the bedroom door at the top. Instead of ascending, he veers towards the kitchen, located at the far end of the hall, and sinks tiredly into a chair.\n\nInside, Mary sits at a small desk, deeply focused on calculations in her notebook. After a moment, she tears a page from the notebook, stands, and meticulously tears it into small pieces. She moves to the bathroom, discards the pieces into the toilet, and flushes it. Then, she removes her robe, steps into the bathtub, and activates the shower. We observe her for a moment as she washes and soaps herself. Suddenly, the bathroom door is slowly pushed open, and a woman's shadow falls across the shower curtain. With her back to the curtain, Mary is unaware until a hand suddenly reaches up, grabs the curtain, and violently tears it aside. Her face contorts in sheer terror.",
    "488": "Norman watches as the car drives away, leaving him standing alone. A vehicle arrives, and Arbogast emerges, leaving the engine running as he crosses the highway. The camera pulls away from the scene. Arbogast proceeds to a phone booth, entering it to make a call. He retrieves a small notebook from his pocket, checks a number, inserts a dime, and dials. After completing his call, he exits the booth.\n\nA distant view shows the House and Motel, with lights on in the house and Norman's office. Norman exits his office, moving along the porch toward the distant cabins with sheets draped over his arm. He enters the last cabin and turns on the light. Meanwhile, a white Ford stops in the foreground, and Arbogast steps out, heading directly to the Motel office. Inside the empty office, he looks around and calls out before entering the parlor filled with birds. He cautiously approaches a door, finding it unlocked, and opens it to investigate further. After a brief inspection, he leaves the office and briskly ascends the stone steps to the House.\n\nThe house is mostly dark inside, save for a faint light from the upstairs hall visible in the foyer. With careful steps, Arbogast ascends the staircase, testing each step to avoid any noise. The camera follows him from the floor level along the stairway. As he reaches the landing, the door to the mother's room opens slowly, revealing Mrs. Bates who steps out with a large knife raised high. She slashes Arbogast across the cheek and neck, causing blood to spurt. He stumbles backward, staggering down the entire staircase, desperately trying to grab the balustrade for support. As he collapses at the bottom, Mrs. Bates looms over him, the camera capturing the repeated motion of the descending knife.\n\nMeanwhile, Lila sits tensely by the phone, appearing as though she hasn't moved in the last hour. Sam paces the room, periodically stopping to glance out the window, adding to the thick atmosphere of smoke, tension, and weariness in the otherwise cozy space.",
    "489": "Sam, concerned about her evident anxiety, stares at her, frowns, and then walks over to the phone to dial the operator. He heads toward the door, with Lila trailing behind him into the darkened store, illuminated only by a faint glow from the back room. Halfway down, he stops, turns, and gently places his hands on her arms. \n\nThe silhouette of Norman stands still, then slowly turns, revealing his profile with his chin lowered as he furtively glances over his shoulder toward the house. From the camera's position at the street door, the tiny figure of Lila can be seen seated and waiting in the back room. Suddenly, she leaps up and dashes through the hardware aisle until her face fills the screen. From her perspective, Sam is seen stepping out of his truck and approaching the store's entrance. He enters, and they exchange quiet glances across the dimly lit room. \n\nLila hands the receiver to the Sheriff, who takes it reluctantly and listens to the distant ringing. Sam and Lila watch the Sheriff, who returns their gaze with a hint of irony in his almost inaudible voice. Meanwhile, in a dimly lit room, Norman sits near the phone, his hand still beside it as if frozen after hanging up, staring at a shrike-like bird perched on the lamp shade. Abruptly, he stands, rushes out, attempting to turn off the lamp but only managing to knock the bird off as he leaves. He extinguishes the lamp, exits the room, crosses the darkened office, and steps outside.\n\nNorman walks off the porch, proceeds along the path to the house, opens the door, and enters. He ascends the stairs, pauses briefly outside his mother's room, then enters, leaving the door ajar. As he moves away, others follow him. A woman, smiling brightly as if at a social gathering, takes the Sheriff's arm and they walk away. The Sheriff nods as he departs. \n\nNow alone at the curb near a deserted chapel, Sam and Lila watch as the truck drives away. Sam takes Lila's arm, and they start walking toward the path leading to the old house. The camera pans with them, and as they round the corner of the office, they spot Norman approaching them along the path.",
    "493": "Malcolm gestures toward the chair positioned across the coffee table, his eyes closing tightly in concentration. Cole, taken aback, advances slightly, then proceeds with another step, inching closer to the indicated chair. Malcolm's eyes flicker open, his gaze fixed directly on Cole. As Cole nears the chair, Malcolm lowers his fingers from his temple and a smile graces his lips. His attention shifts to the large silver watch adorning Cole's slender wrist, which appears oversized on him.\n\nMalcolm's eyes close once more, prompting Cole to retreat a step backward. Surprised, Malcolm lowers his hands and places his fingers back to his temple, his eyes now studying Cole's school uniform. Cole, responding to the silent exchange, takes a slow step back, his movements deliberate. Malcolm's gaze drops to Cole's feet, noting how Cole stands completely still. After a moment of silent observation, Malcolm finally breaks the stillness to speak, his eyes locked on Cole.\n\nCole, seemingly shrinking, steps back into the doorway of the adjacent room, his small frame retreating further. Meanwhile, Malcolm, in a rush, enters a spacious, dimly-lit Italian restaurant where he locates Anna. She sits alone at a corner table, a small piece of cake with a candle, untouched beside her. As Malcolm takes the seat opposite her, Anna stirs sugar into her coffee and takes a quiet sip, her eyes briefly meeting his before lowering.\n\nMalcolm, demonstrating a protective gesture, holds his arm up to shield his face, then halts his walk as the impact of unspoken words strikes him deeply. His focus shifts back to Cole, who appears surprised while playing behind a couch. Only the top of Cole's head is visible, with occasional glimpses of toys over the couch's back, though their nature remains obscure. Cole's movements cease, and he becomes very still, his eyes meeting Malcolm's who watches him intently.\n\nRising, Malcolm grabs his coat, while Cole's brow furrows in thoughtful concentration. Cole's sad eyes look up at Malcolm, who turns back to him after being engrossed in study. Malcolm's desk is strewn with open texts, and he meticulously pours over a thick reference book, circling a phrase of interest. His gaze lifts to the ceiling as he stretches his legs, drawn towards nearby voices.\n\nMalcolm offers a smile to Anna, which slowly fades as he shakes his head in disbelief. In a classroom setting, Mr. Cunningham turns to face his group of young private school students. Cole, resting his chin on his desk, watches the class with wide eyes. As Mr. Cunningham surveys the sea of blank faces, he's about to answer his own question when a hand unexpectedly rises, prompting a look of surprise from him as he identifies the source.",
    "495": "Malcolm, overwhelmed by his thoughts, lets his hand with the tape recorder drop to his side as he stares into the night, standing alone. Meanwhile, Lynn enters her home carrying her sleeping son, Cole, on her shoulder. She gently lays him down in his bedroom next to his German Shepherd puppy. Cole, still asleep, clutches a tiny party hat in his hands. Lynn, who has been carrying Cole's sweater over her shoulder, removes it and begins to fold it. Her attention shifts as she inspects the fabric of the sweater, discovering it's ripped. Turning her focus to Cole, she notices three small tears in the middle of the back of his T-shirt. Gently pushing the fabric aside, Lynn finds deep fingernail-like scratches on his skin. A sense of helplessness and fear envelops her as she surveys the eerily still house, filled with an unnatural silence, the thermostat chillingly reading fifty-two degrees.\n\nLater, the door to Cole's room cracks open as his tiny face peeks out, scanning the darkness. Nervously, he opens the door a bit more, his knees pressed together and body dancing slightly as he urgently needs to pee. He cautiously moves into the hall and briskly walks to the bathroom halfway down the corridor. Turning on the light, Cole checks behind the shower curtain before peeing into the toilet. Suddenly, he stops, becoming very still. Slowly, he reaches for the toilet handle and flushes, closes his pants, and turns to face the dark hallway, his breath forming tiny clouds in the cold air. Catching a slant of light from the kitchen, Cole moves down the hall and turns the corner, stopping in the doorway.\n\nIn the kitchen, Cole sees the back of a person cooking at the stove. Initially, his fear diminishes, but then his face turns ashen as he backs up to the doorway. The woman cooking turns, smiling menacingly as she thrusts her savagely cut wrists forward. Terrified, Cole turns and runs back down the hall to his room. He races across the room and scurries into his bed, his legs disappearing as the bedsheets flap closed behind him. The crazed woman now stands at the end of the hall. Inside his tent, Cole curls up amidst the red interior, illuminated as the bedsheet walls, lined with taped religious pictures, offer a momentary sanctuary.",
    "498": "Cole's attention shifts back to the bed as his mother's voice calls out to him. He sees her lying there, her face twisted in profound sadness as she murmurs in her sleep. With gentle curiosity, Cole reaches out and touches her face with his small fingers, their eyes locking in a trembling gaze. He struggles to find words, his mouth opening slowly before finally speaking.\n\nTransitioning scenes, Cole and Malcolm find themselves aboard a downtown Septa public bus, both dressed in suits amidst other passengers. Cole rests his head against the scratched window, his large eyes absorbing the cityscape as it passes by. Meanwhile, Malcolm sinks back into silence as the bus navigates through the old streets of Philadelphia towards downtown.\n\nArriving at a house, rows of parked cars extend from the driveway into the street. People in formal attire somberly move in and out of the front door. Cole and Malcolm blend in with the mourners, approaching the house slowly. Outside, a frail four-year-old girl in a dark dress sits quietly on a swing.\n\nInside, the home is crowded, packed with standing mourners. The air is filled with dozens of hushed conversations. Cole pauses at the doorway, staring quietly inward. After a long moment, he reaches for the doorknob and steps into the house.\n\nCole's gaze drifts to the girl's bedroom, where a hospital bed sits near the window. The walls are adorned with an array of get-well cards and colorful drawings from family, friends, and schoolchildren. The shelves are brimming with puppets, alongside a puppet stage and a camcorder mounted on a mini tripod. Cole approaches the shelf, selecting a finger puppet dancer which he slips into his pocket.\n\nOn the girl's desk, a collection of video cassettes catches his eye. He examines their labels before turning his attention to the closets. Suddenly, he notices the girl’s hand retreating back under the bed. Cole freezes, then cautiously bends down, his hands touching the floor. Tilting his head, he peers underneath to see the emaciated girl from his tent, curled up and staring back at him with wide, glaring eyes. She suddenly moves, thrusting a jewelry box across the wooden floor until it stops just short of Cole. They exchange a long, silent stare.\n\nThe room is crowded with mourners, many of whom are gathered around the girl’s mother, a young woman in her late twenties. From the doorway, Malcolm watches breathlessly as Cole navigates through the sea of adults. Nearby, the girl’s father, Mr. Collins, a thin man also in his late twenties, sits on a reading chair next to a television.",
    "504": "Louise effortlessly returns to the road, as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred. Unbeknownst to them, they remain undetected. J.D. and Louise exchange a glance. Meanwhile, Hal is engaged in a phone conversation with an FBI agent. Darryl sits in a chair, appearing dazed. Various law enforcement officers are scattered throughout the house. Max Stratton, an FBI agent in his early forties, examines ident-a-kit drawings of Louise and Thelma. The T-Bird speeds down the road. Louise, Thelma, and J.D. arrive at a motel parking lot. Louise, after a brief look at J.D. in the back seat, removes the keys from the ignition and exits the vehicle to enter the motel. An older woman at the counter is focused on a computer screen. Startled, Louise swiftly turns around. J.D. emerges from the car, visibly uncomfortable. Jimmy smiles, while Thelma observes. Louise turns to face Thelma. Suddenly, J.D. attacks her again, prompting a gasp from Thelma. Louise watches Thelma closely as she squirms in her seat, barely containing her excitement, which erupts into hysterical laughter. Louise suddenly grasps the situation and feels a sense of foreboding. She stands, placing money on the table, as Thelma, oblivious to the money, laughs. Both leave the restaurant and break into a run as they exit. Louise, fighting back tears, remains stoic. She sits down on the sidewalk in front of their room, soon joined by Thelma. For a moment, neither speaks, until Louise quietly begins to unravel, spurring Thelma into action. Still seated on the sidewalk, Louise slowly rises to her feet. The green T-Bird's rear wheel screeches as it exits the motel parking lot, with Thelma and a slightly rougher-looking Louise driving away. Hal, the FBI agent, and various other law enforcement officers arrive at the house. The front door swings open to reveal Darryl, who appears as if he's been propelled out of a cannon. Louise and Thelma stop at a convenience store. Inside, police are busy tapping phones and dusting for fingerprints, while Darryl sits motionless in his recliner, a blank look on his face. Max joins Hal and the others as they walk down a hallway. Thelma and Louise sit in their car. Louise looks at Thelma, who shrieks with excitement, leaving Louise completely stunned. Louise shoots Thelma a look, then shifts the car into gear and accelerates out of the parking lot, still eyeing Thelma as if she's lost her mind. Hal, Max, other officers, and Darryl watch a VCR tape on TV, which shows Thelma in the convenience store brandishing a gun.",
    "507": "For a brief moment, both Louise and Thelma fall silent, enveloped in a pause that speaks volumes. Suddenly, Louise accelerates slightly, prompting Hal to respond with a smile. The surveillance man, observing from a distance, gestures for Hal to continue whatever he is doing. Meanwhile, Louise's eyes widen in shock upon overhearing this exchange.\n\nIn a tense moment, an unseen finger presses down a phone lever, disconnecting the call. Louise, still gripping the phone, stands frozen with her finger on the lever. Thelma, nearby, stops and looks directly at her, puzzled by the sudden silence. Max, on the other end of the line, is caught off guard by Thelma's unexpected outburst, while Louise remains astonished by the words she hears from Thelma.\n\nOnce again, both women lapse into a quiet moment before Louise starts the car. With a lurch, they shift into reverse and then screech forward, speeding down the road. Amidst the rush, laughter erupts between them as the car continues its rapid journey down the road under the rising sun. Eventually, they reach a desolate intersection and veer onto a dirt road, coming to a halt.\n\nNearby, a trucker reaches into his glove compartment, packed with condoms, grabs a few, and pockets them before shutting off his engine and exiting the truck. He approaches their vehicle, causing both Louise and Thelma to step out. Louise gives a nod, signaling an unexpected twist in their situation, which visibly unsettles the trucker as he grows increasingly anxious.\n\nWithout hesitation, Louise brandishes a gun they had stolen from a state patrolman. She aims it at the trucker's distant vehicle, taking a moment to steady her aim before firing twice, puncturing two of the tires. The truck visibly sinks as air hisses out of the flattened tires. Exchanging a glance, Louise and Thelma then turn their attention to the truck's tankers, unleashing a barrage of gunfire that results in a massive explosion.\n\nThe truck driver, witnessing the destruction, lets out a scream of horror. In response, Louise starts the car and begins driving circles around him, while both Thelma and she howl wildly. Meanwhile, a fleet of state police cars, resembling a small army, pours out of a nearby parking lot, lights flashing. Additional police units converge from all directions across the desert, creating a massive dust cloud in their pursuit, though none manage to get ahead of the fleeing car.\n\nAs they speed towards their destination, Thelma gazes ahead at the ever-growing spectacle of the Grand Canyon, looming majestically in the distance.",
    "512": "On the ice, Player One delivers a devastating blow, slamming his fist into Player Two's nose. Blood erupts like a geyser, sending Player Two crashing to the ice. Amidst the chaos, Holden, utterly flabbergasted, locks eyes with Alyssa. The surrounding crowd, more intrigued by the tension between Holden and Alyssa than the fight on the ice, watches in shock. Alyssa, seething with anger, storms off, her fury palpable. Holden quickly follows, chasing after her.\n\nAs Alyssa briskly walks away, pulling on her coat, Holden catches up to her. He pulls back, hesitant, while Alyssa fixes him with a stare brimming with hurt and rage. Holden's gaze drops to the ground, unable to meet her eyes. Alyssa, awaiting a response, stands in tense silence. Defeated, Holden slinks away, leaving Alyssa to unleash her frustration on a nearby car, kicking and punching it until she collapses to the ground in tears.\n\nLater, Holden sits alone in the dark on a couch until Banky enters and joins him, offering a comforting arm. Transitioning scenes, Holden is now seated alone at a booth, until Jay and Silent Bob appear and slide in across from him. Holden tosses an envelope to Jay, who begins rolling a joint, while Silent Bob leafs through a comic. A waitress joins them, serving their order, but she stares in offense at Jay. The atmosphere turns silent, broken only when Holden's head snaps forward in shock at something Silent Bob does with his hands. Both Jay and Holden watch, stunned, as Silent Bob then backhands Jay, who raises his fist in retaliation but pauses as Silent Bob lights a cigarette. Jay and Silent Bob then exit, leaving Holden to ponder in the booth.\n\nSeeking solace, Holden visits a park where he and Alyssa once walked, staring at her yearbook picture when a sudden idea strikes him. He leaps up and rushes out of the park. Back in a room, Holden grabs a chair and positions it in front of Banky and Alyssa seated on a couch. Pacing anxiously, Holden watches as Alyssa's expression falls, subtly shaking her head. The room falls silent. Alyssa lights a cigarette, her head drooping in dismay. Banky, wide-eyed, stares forward before shrugging. Holden offers a supportive smile to Banky before turning his attention to Alyssa, moving to sit beside her on the couch. Alyssa looks at him with a sad gaze.\n\nIn a moment of relief, Banky sighs, while Holden reacts to Alyssa's tear rolling down her cheek. She gently touches his face, then abruptly slaps him. Filled with turmoil, Alyssa storms out, pausing only to give Banky a once-over before exiting the studio. The door closes behind her, leaving Banky and Holden in a silent, poignant stand-off. The scene concludes as a copy of 'Bluntman and Chronic' enters the frame.",
    "515": "The flashback concludes, and Mickey finds himself back in the present, sitting in his dimly lit living room where light filters in through a window behind the couch. A coffee table is positioned in front of the couch, while scattered papers litter the floor. Rising from where he had been seated, Mickey begins to pace back and forth as he speaks over the screen.\n\nMeanwhile, a performance of Manon Lescaut is underway. Onstage, the soprano in the title role delivers a mournful aria, kneeling by the ruins of a wagon against a dark backdrop. The camera then shifts upward to the private boxes in the upper loge, where David and Holly are visible from a distance. David turns to glance at Holly, then reaches down to retrieve a bottle of wine. The focus momentarily returns to the stage, capturing the soprano leaning on a wagon wheel as her voice soars. The scene cuts back to Holly and David in their box, closer this time. As the aria continues, David pours wine into two glasses, handing one to a smiling Holly, who mouths a thank you and glances around. They look at each other, raising their glasses in a toast.\n\nIn another setting, Lee, dressed in a baggy plaid shirt and jeans, opens the door for Elliot and his client, the wealthy rock star Dusty Frye. After closing the door behind them, Lee walks over to Dusty, chuckling at his appearance—sunglasses, a red-imprinted T-shirt, and a baggy coat. She then turns and leads Frederick, Elliot, and Dusty deeper into the loft, her hands clasped behind her back. Frederick covers his face, trying to hide his disgust. As Dusty speaks, the camera follows Elliot as he moves past the group to closely examine two framed nude drawings of Lee displayed on an easel. Elliot glances at the drawings admiringly, then steals a look at Lee, appreciating her physique while she talks to Dusty and Frederick offscreen. The camera then shifts to follow the enthusiastic Lee as she takes Dusty by the arm and starts guiding him towards the door, with Frederick trailing behind at a distance. The focus returns to Elliot, who remains fixated on the nude drawings as the sounds of Frederick's and Dusty's footsteps fade away, indicating their exit from the loft. Elliot turns and offers a hesitant smile to Lee, who is offscreen, and laughs. Lee, feeling uneasy, looks down, and an awkward silence ensues. Quickly, Lee moves to the stereo unit, selects a record from the shelf, removes it from its jacket, and places it on the turntable. With the record in place, she leans back against the stereo unit.",
    "521": "The film begins with a jogger dashing across the path of the protagonist. It then swiftly shifts to a flashback of Mickey's date with Holly, starting at a rock club where the audience is captivated by a performance from the band The 39 Steps. Among the crowd, three punkers—a girl with pink hair, another with a spiked mohawk, and a guy sporting Stevie Wonder braids and sunglasses—enthusiastically nod to the music.\n\nThe camera pans to the stage, showcasing a sleazy-looking rock band in the throes of their song. As the band's volume fills the air, the camera sweeps across the mesmerized audience seated at crowded, smoky tables. At one such table, a visibly distressed Mickey and an entranced Holly are pressed close together. Nearby, an audience member drinks beer from a bottle.\n\nHolly, tapping her foot to the beat and clearly enjoying herself, takes a drag from her cigarette. She shoots an impatient look at Mickey before turning her attention back to the band, who are still energetically performing. The camera then follows down the body of the lead singer—from his curly red hair, through his cut-off red shirt and sweaty torso, to his guitar.\n\nReturning to Holly and Mickey, who appear even more agitated, they remain surrounded by a throng of people. In the background, a waitress stands with a tray aloft. Another man sips from a glass mug amidst the indistinct chatter of the crowd over the loud music. Holly, now openly annoyed, glances at Mickey again.\n\nShe then opens a vial of cocaine, holds a short metal straw to her nose, and sniffs the drug. As Mickey pleads with her, Holly stows the vial in her purse. She holds a finger against one nostril and sniffs, then picks up her lit cigarette and resumes smoking.\n\nThe scene transitions to Mickey and Holly briskly walking down a sidewalk in near silhouette, engaged in a heated argument. They pass by illuminated clothing store windows and a few cars moving along the dark street.\n\nBack inside the club, the audience watches on, some with smiles of contentment. A man has his arm around a woman. At their table, a candle flickers in its holder as Mickey and Holly sit. Holly retrieves a cigarette from her purse, her hand moving to her nose to sniff once more. Mickey keeps stealing glances at Holly, who seems unable to stay still.\n\nHolly lights her cigarette, inadvertently dropping her matchbook. She bends to retrieve it, then begins to fidget in her chair. She takes a gulp of wine and sniffs again. Meanwhile, Mickey tries to focus on the offscreen performance of Bobby Short, crossing his arms over his chest. The film briefly cuts back to Bobby Short at the piano.\n\nThe scene closes with a taxi driving away from the curb as Mickey and Holly exit a hotel through its revolving doors.",
    "513": "Lee, after glancing over her shoulder, decisively turns away from the doorway and strides off. The camera trails her movement, passing over a bookshelf brimming with books and photographs, which momentarily shields her as she enters a bustling yet cozy vestibule filled with people. Some are sipping drinks, others are just arriving, all contributing to the lively atmosphere with their overlapping, friendly chatter. Lee, wearing a warm smile, navigates through the crowd, exchanging cordial greetings.\n\nAs she proceeds into the living room, Lee briefly turns to share a few words with a child she has just embraced. Continuing her journey, the camera remains fixed on her as she pauses to engage in a cheerful conversation with her mother. After concluding their chat, Lee resumes her path, passing by other guests until she reaches April, whom she greets with a heartfelt, though brief, hug.\n\nMeanwhile, Elliot's voice-over persists as the camera shifts to show him standing in a doorway, engaged in dialogue with a gesticulating, stout man. Both men are clutching drinks as Lee, now carrying a tray of hors d'oeuvres and two drinks, maneuvers through the tight space between them. They lift their drinks to give her passage. Elliot's gaze follows Lee as she walks away, while his companion, seemingly unaware, carries on talking. Despite returning his attention to the conversation, Elliot cannot resist stealing glances towards the offscreen Lee as the other man's monologue continues.\n\nThe camera refocuses on Lee, who is still smiling as she sets down her tray and drinks next to April. Lee then briskly passes a doorway, oblivious to Elliot who, still ruminating, watches her with rapt attention. The camera lingers on Elliot, his eyes fixed on the unseen Lee, while the background fills with the warm, continuous chatter of other guests.\n\nHannah, carrying another tray of hors d'oeuvres, approaches the preoccupied Elliot from behind. He takes an hors d'oeuvre and begins nibbling as he and Hannah move past the bookshelf and into the living room. As they continue eating and conversing, they pass a hallway and move out of view, just as Holly comes into sight walking down that hallway. Holly, holding a drink and a plate of hors d'oeuvres, stands at the hallway's entrance, eating and observing the guests offscreen. Onscreen, Holly takes a loud swallow, then sips her drink as Hannah and Elliot approach her, leading to a shared burst of laughter between Holly and Hannah.\n\nHannah, licking her fingers, moves past a refrigerator plastered with memos to the stove, with Holly following closely and beginning to speak. As Holly continues her monologue and sips her drink, Hannah busily navigates the kitchen—a hub of party activity with a large center table piled high with bowls and plates of food, hanging pots and pans, and assorted party clutter. Hannah moves in and out of view as she listens and responds to her sister.",
    "528": "At a sophisticated gathering, a couple stands by a window as another man rises from his chair and departs. Guests, sipping their drinks with smiles, are captured by the camera as it pans to a piano and a wall adorned with books. Evan plays the piano energetically, while Norma, standing behind him, displays a poignant and wistful expression. Mavis, the maid, walks through with a tray of hors d'oeuvres, and a man takes one, silently expressing his gratitude. The camera then moves past an open bookshelf and two boys in suits, sipping soda and munching, to focus on Lee, who leans against a doorway, a distant look on her face, listening to the music. Mavis passes by in the hall beyond the doorway. Nearby, several people are engrossed in conversation as Elliot, drink in hand, approaches Lee from behind. Lee slips away past Elliot and walks off. Elliot briefly watches her, sips his drink, and then turns to gaze at the crowd in the living room.\n\nIn the pantry, Holly is preparing food out of sight. Hannah enters, heading directly for the refrigerator, carrying two tomatoes. She opens the fridge, completely ignoring Holly, then moves to the table to gather more food. Meanwhile, Holly goes to the sink to wash her hands. As she dries them, Hannah, now carrying an array of vegetables, strides towards her sister. Hannah storms out through a nearby door while Holly turns away from the sink. Holly wipes her hands on a towel as Hannah reenters the kitchen, this time with even more vegetables. Hannah strides back into the pantry area, forcefully dropping the vegetables onto the counter. Holly, somewhat distractedly, sets down the dishtowel and tidies up the food-laden table. Angrily, Hannah grabs some spices from the table, while Holly returns onscreen, holding a silver ice bucket. Holly pauses at the corner of the table and faces Hannah, who picks up a large bowl and, along with her spices, carries it into the pantry. Reacting, Hannah places the spices on the pantry counter, and Holly turns away.\n\nIn the living room, guests mingle, talk, and serve themselves at a buffet table. Offscreen, Lee and Elliot's voices rise in an intense conversation, as the camera slowly sweeps from the doorway across the empty dining room to show them. Lee quickly goes to an open door and shuts it. The door soon reopens, revealing Mavis carrying a set of candlesticks. She places them on the dining room table, already set with a floral centerpiece, glassware, and china, while Lee and Elliot stand awkwardly near the door, waiting for her to leave.",
    "529": "In the film, the scene transitions to Hannah's kitchen where two characters exchange a meaningful glance. Across the swinging door of the pantry, Norma's face is visible through the porthole window. After scanning the kitchen, she opens the door and enters. Nearby, Holly is busy in the pantry and lets out a chuckle. Norma then exits the kitchen, the door swinging closed behind her. Holly, sipping her wine, watches the door as the scene shifts to Hannah's living room.\n\nIn the living room, a jovial, plump uncle is seated on a sofa with a child on his lap, surrounded by other children sitting cross-legged on the floor. They lean over a coffee table cluttered with glasses and a bowl of chips. In the background, other guests socialize; one couple enters the room, smiling at the scene. Mavis, meanwhile, crosses the brightly lit foyer to welcome more guests at the door. The uncle cheerfully pours beer from his bottle into the children's glasses, prompting excited cries from them. Laughing, he turns to the little girl on his lap, clinking his bottle against hers, which is nearly as large as she is. They all merrily drink their beer as the film cuts to Hannah's bedroom, showing subtly patterned wallpaper.\n\nHannah's face then appears on screen. She approaches Elliot, who is in the bathroom by the sink. Elliot moves behind a partially closed door to an unseen medicine cabinet, then returns to the sink, partially obscured again. As Hannah continues speaking, Elliot dries his hands, closes the door briefly obscuring them both, and the camera follows behind the door into the bathroom. He opens the medicine cabinet, returns an aspirin bottle, and slams it shut before leaving. Hannah watches him leave, visibly stunned. Soft piano music plays as she walks down the hallway into the living room, lost in thought, and sits heavily on the couch arm. The camera pans to framed photographs on the mantel, zooming in on one of Hannah, Lee, and Holly, the three sisters smiling.\n\nThe scene then shows a bedroom night table adorned with a small lamp, a wooden box, a cast-iron fire truck, an ashtray, and glasses. Elliot, in pajamas, reaches into view and turns off the lamp, plunging the room into darkness. Moments later, he turns the lamp back on and turns towards Hannah, who lies partially shadowed on her side of the bed.",
    "530": "In the opening scene, Mickey shares an intimate moment as he leans over and kisses his partner. Transitioning to a bustling city scene, Mickey, with his hands tucked into his pockets, blends into the crowd of pedestrians walking along the sidewalk. As he continues his walk, he pulls his coat tighter around him to ward off the chill. His stroll leads him to pause outside a store where he catches a glimpse of Holly through the window. Inside, Holly, with her jacket casually draped over her shoulders, browses through a selection of records.\n\nDriven by curiosity, Mickey enters Tower Records through its revolving doors, ascends a few stairs to the main selling area, and approaches Holly directly. Holly responds with a chuckle and shifts her attention back to the records, strolling down the aisle and occasionally peering into the bins. Mickey joins her, walking by her side, and then steps back into the frame as they continue their conversation under the shadow of a prominent Jazz sign adorned with a large red circle. Mickey picks out a record to examine, prompting Holly to watch him with a hopeful expression. As Mickey returns the record to its bin, Holly laughs, a bit embarrassed, and then chuckles again, momentarily looking away.\n\nThe narrative shifts abruptly as the screen transitions to the interior of Mickey's apartment, focusing on a chaise lounge. Nearby, an ashtray rests on a stand, and the camera pans down the chaise, passing over several stacks of books, to reach Mickey's coffee table. Here, Mickey sits on the edge of the table, fidgeting with his fingers and listening attentively to Holly, who sits cross-legged on the floor, supported by a pillow, and reads her script aloud. After finishing, Holly closes her script and looks up at Mickey, who responds with a smile and a shrug, unsure of what to say. Overwhelmed by Mickey's reaction, Holly stands up, her hand on her head, and begins pacing the room, her script in hand, as the camera follows her movements, leaving Mickey offscreen.\n\nThe scene shifts outdoors, where trees line the sidewalk. Holly and Mickey exit their apartment and walk up the street, passing a few other people amidst a row of similar apartment buildings. The film then cuts to the exterior of a quaint café made of glass and stained wood. Through its window, Holly and Mickey are visible enjoying lunch, with Holly gesturing animatedly while Mickey sips his coffee. As some passersby move past the café, the film transitions to an almost deserted path in Central Park, illuminated by old-fashioned streetlamps and dotted with fallen leaves. Holly and Mickey appear, deeply engrossed in conversation as they walk into view.\n\nSuddenly, the film shifts to a flashback initiated by Mickey, serving as a visual counterpoint to the story he is sharing with Holly. The screen shows a close-up of Mickey, alone in his apartment, looking nervous, perspiring, and panting. His voice narrates the scene as he raises the barrel of a rifle to his forehead and tightly shuts his eyes. The camera then pans past him to focus on a mirror on the wall behind him, reflecting his desperate state.",
    "532": "In a softly lit room, a woman named Lee is engrossed in flipping through the pages of a book near a curtained window. She then sets the book down on a desk and picks up another one, her attention briefly turning to someone named Elliot who is offscreen. Her gaze lingers on him, prompting a noticeable reaction from her.\n\nThe camera shifts to focus on Elliot, who is blushing. As he walks across the room, Lee speaks, and he moves to part a curtain, revealing a stereo and some records. Elliot glances back at Lee offscreen, then reaches into the stereo shelf, but instead of a record, he pulls out a bottle of antihistamines. Meanwhile, Lee sits down on the bed, still clutching her book.\n\nElliot then crosses the room to join Lee, seating himself on a footstool in front of her. A shared moment of light-heartedness ensues as Lee chuckles, her laughter contagious as Elliot smiles and joins in the chuckle.\n\nThe scene shifts as Hannah enters the room, munching on a carrot stick, drawing the camera's attention momentarily as she approaches Elliot and Lee. Laughter fills the air from Holly, causing Lee to glance over and react. Hannah, caught in a moment of embarrassment, covers her face with her hands and sits down. The group's attention turns to Evan, who listens quietly. Amidst the playful atmosphere, Hannah, still embarrassed yet playful, makes a victory sign. Lee and Holly struggle to suppress their laughter, while Norma glares disapprovingly at the scene.\n\nElliot, showing affection, wraps his arm around Hannah, pulling her close and planting a gentle kiss on her cheek, which she reciprocates with a hug. The mood lifts as Mavis, the maid, exits with trays, and the group erupts into cheers and applause. Holly waves her napkin at April and raises her wine glass in a toast to Hannah, who reacts with a smile tinged with embarrassment.\n\nAs the guests sip their wine and quiet down, Norma resumes speaking, but Lee and Holly can't help but burst into laughter again. Mavis reenters to serve more food to the children. Norma then toasts her daughter, prompting everyone to follow suit, and the room fills once more with applause and cheers. Hannah chuckles in response, her embarrassment softening into warmth as she takes Elliot's hand, looking around the table. Elliot, in a tender gesture, kneads her shoulder, both of them sharing a chuckle filled with affection. Hannah, still feeling a hint of embarrassment, gazes down at a plate in front of her.\n\nThe group's applause crescendos as they toast and drink, their approval ringing warmly through the room. The sound of classical string music begins to play, signaling a transition as the scene cuts to a taxi cruising down Broadway towards the camera. The taxi passes a truck, the Winter Garden marquee showcasing \"Cats,\" and numerous buildings before exiting the frame, with the classical music continuing to play as the movie shifts focus to the taxi's backseat.\n\nInside, Lee sits by the window, her head resting in her hand, a reflective expression on her face. The scene moves to a modern kitchen area within a loft where Lee stirs a cup of coffee on the counter, near a vase filled with flowers. She then walks across the spacious loft, characterized by its high ceilings and beige walls, holding her coffee as she passes by a modern chaise, a bookcase, several sofas, and two columns.",
    "534": "In the opening scene, a woman shoots a look of disgust at Ron before gesturing dismissively. Shortly after, Ron lets out a cough. Nearby, Gail circumnavigates a chair with purpose. The camera then captures a reflection in a cluttered makeup mirror, revealing a conversation between the woman and Mickey with Ron. As the dialogue continues, Ron emits a sigh. The mirror reflects Mickey beginning to pace restlessly.\n\nThe scene shifts to Norman, a Los Angeles TV producer and former partner of Mickey, cruising down a serene street lined with palm trees. He's dressed in sunglasses and headphones, his fingers snapping in rhythm to the music only he can hear from his Walkman. A content smile graces his face while Mickey's voice overlays the sun-drenched scene.\n\nAs Mickey concludes his thoughts, the focus transitions to Hannah approaching her front door. She opens it, her back facing the camera, to find Mickey waiting with two boxed gifts in hand. Hannah nods patiently, offering a comforting pat on Mickey's back as they move from the foyer into the den, where the twins are engrossed in play. Mickey, still wearing his coat, presents each twin with a gift. The twins set their presents down—one on the sofa, the other on the coffee table—before enveloping their father in a hug. The moment is interrupted by the sound of breaking glass, prompting a reaction from both Hannah and Mickey.\n\nThe narrative then follows Mickey walking along a West Side street, his hands tucked into his coat pockets. He pushes open the exterior door of Dr. Abel's office, leading to a cut to the doctor's consultation room. Dr. Abel is seen rifling through a file cabinet in the doorway. As Mickey responds from offscreen, Dr. Abel turns and approaches him. The camera tracks the doctor's movement from behind a wall, momentarily obscuring him, then pans across a dark examining-room wall to a second doorway where Mickey is seated on a stool, continuing his conversation.\n\nDr. Abel reappears onscreen, and both he and Mickey are now visible through the second doorway. Standing directly in front of the seated Mickey, Dr. Abel stares down at him as he speaks, eventually letting out a chuckle. The soundtrack shifts to an uptempo big-band tune as the movie transitions to Mickey's examination. A close-up shows Dr. Abel using an otoscope on a visibly nervous Mickey. The film then depicts Dr. Abel's hands adjusting the dials on a sonometer while Mickey, perched on a high stool with large earphones on, listens intently, his eyes squinting in concentration. He signals with a raised finger in response to the sounds.\n\nThe examination continues with Dr. Abel striking a large tuning fork and placing it against Mickey's ear. Mickey nods, looking up at Dr. Abel's face, which remains offscreen. The scene concludes with Dr. Abel exiting the examining room, walking through the consultation room, and entering a second examining room across the way.",
    "535": "As Mickey walks and converses with an offscreen Dr. Abel, the camera remains fixed on the doorway to the second examining room where Dr. Abel momentarily appears before moving out of view. Preoccupied, Dr. Abel reenters the consultation room, clutching Mickey's open file. He strides towards his desk, unveiling a visibly frightened Mickey seated across from it. Standing, the doctor leans over the desk, his back facing the camera, jotting down notes in the file. A chuckle escapes Dr. Abel as he closes Mickey's file and stands upright, the camera peering over his shoulders at the anxious Mickey. Dr. Abel then places his pen atop the closed file, walks around his desk, and perches on its edge near Mickey.\n\nThe scene shifts to Mickey, now in a telephone booth near Dr. Abel's office under a steady rain. Traffic flows across a nearby intersection as a couple with an umbrella walks past. The film then cuts to Dr. Wilkes, relaxed in his office, leaning back in his chair and dangling his stethoscope while on the phone. Behind him, a chest X-ray illuminates on a light panel. The movie toggles between Mickey, who queries from the phone booth, and Dr. Wilkes, who responds from his office.\n\nIn a different setting, Gail, her glasses perched on her nose, stands behind a busy yet organized desk flanked by two assistants. As they depart, Gail calls out to them, but her attention shifts as the telephone rings. She removes her glasses, squints, and then the film cuts to Mickey, who is pacing and wringing his hands anxiously. He approaches Gail, panting and scanning the room with worry. Gail, visibly concerned, watches Mickey as he continues to wring his hands. She takes a seat and answers the phone, later hanging it up. Mickey resumes pacing, sighing deeply, and continues to wring and blow on his hands.\n\nThe camera then focuses on an abstract painting on a wall, accompanied by light laughter and sophisticated music from offscreen brunch guests. Holly enters the frame in front of the painting, carrying a nearly empty tray of hors d'oeuvres and dressed in a uniform. A man takes the last shrimp puff from her tray with a murmured thanks as she passes. Holly eventually navigates her way into a cluttered loft kitchen, her tray now empty.",
    "536": "In the bustling kitchen of a lively party, Holly, filled with excitement, dashes toward April, who is carefully extracting a steaming Stroganoff from the oven. Both women are clad in matching uniforms: black skirts, white shirts, and black bowties. April, gripping the hot dish, swiftly exits the kitchen to attend to the eager party guests. From offscreen, Holly calls out to her, just as David strides past the bustling April and enters the kitchen.\n\nDavid approaches Holly, who is preoccupied with cooking at a stove cluttered with pots and pans. As Holly carries a quiche out to the party, April reenters the kitchen through a different doorway. She brushes past David to a counter and starts meticulously folding napkins. Meanwhile, David casually leans against the sink. The two shake hands in a friendly gesture. April then moves offscreen to another part of the kitchen.\n\nHolly grabs a napkin from the crowded table, and David circles around, placing a plate of clams on the already packed surface. Holly trails him, a chuckle escaping her lips as she tosses her napkin into an offscreen garbage can. They pause by a small television set near the doorway, where David stops to watch. The screen emits canned laughter and miscellaneous chatter, while guests in the adjacent room can be seen conversing in clusters. David, still nibbling on a clam, listens as Holly and April offer reassurances from offscreen.\n\nChecking his wristwatch, David is approached by Holly, who chuckles as he, impressed by something April said, walks over to her at the table. April also laughs as Holly reappears onscreen, busy preparing another tray of hors d'oeuvres. The trio exchange glances, and Holly shrugs nonchalantly.\n\nThe scene shifts to an exterior view of a contemporary red building designed by David, nestled between two older structures. The voices of Holly, April, and David are heard offscreen as the camera pans down from the buildings to show the trio seated in David's Jaguar parked across the street. David and April occupy the front seats, while Holly is squeezed into the back, her head slightly forward. David briefly turns to glance at Holly before refocusing on April.\n\nThe camera explores the ornate facade of a rococo building, then shifts to display the elegant building next to it. It then transitions to an ultra-modern structure adorned with tiny, diamond-shaped motifs, and further to its equally unappealing entrance. A large car is parked directly in front of this building.\n\nThe group is then seen descending the canopied entrance stairs of an apartment house on the opposite side of the street, from where they had been observing the contrasting facades. David leads the way, with the women following; Holly trails slightly behind April. As they reach the bottom, David leans over the roof of the car, looking at the women and awaiting their decision.",
    "541": "Half of the boat has been reduced to splinters by the time the relentless blades draw nearer, their wind brushing against the necks of those aboard. In a critical moment, Indy seizes Kazim and leaps into a motorboat skillfully piloted by Elsa, which arrives just in the nick of time alongside the disintegrating vessel. As they stabilize, Kazim lifts his shirt to display a mark on his chest; it's either a birthmark or a tattoo, resembling a cruciform sword—a Christian cross that narrows like a broadsword's blade. The boat nears the canal's edge, prompting Kazim to disembark and walk away.\n\nClose scrutiny is given to a water-soaked paper impression, a rubbing from the shield of the Grail Knight, by Brody, who simultaneously nurses a bump on his head with an ice pack. Dressed in a bathrobe, Indy leans in to examine the impression alongside him. Brody momentarily lowers the ice pack to glance at Indy before lifting the Grail Diary, which spans two pages of detailed entries. His finger traces the text as Indy, after closing the diary, slips it into his robe's pocket and proceeds to open his bedroom door, revealing a ransacked space with the mattress tossed to the floor and drawers emptied.\n\nConcerned, Indy moves to Elsa's room, knocking before entering to find it similarly disturbed. Worried for her safety, he calls out and taps on the bathroom door. Upon opening it, he discovers Elsa, startled, in front of a mirror, clad in a silk bathrobe. As she reaches to switch off a record player perched above the bathtub, Indy steps back into her bedroom. Rejoining him in the disheveled room, Elsa looks around in disbelief and then at Indy, who retrieves the Grail Diary from his pocket. As she steps closer, her frustration peaks, and she stomps her foot before attempting to leave. Indy, however, pulls her close and kisses her passionately, leading to an exchange of affection that culminates with them falling onto the bed, their intimate moment underscored by the melodious singing of a gondolier passing their window.\n\nTheir romantic interlude is momentarily interrupted by the sound of the gondolier's song, but Elsa quickly pulls Indy back to her. Meanwhile, a Mercedes-Benz navigates the sharp curves of mountainous terrain, its journey superimposed over a map tracing a route from Venice through Austria towards Salzburg, under the increasingly ominous storm clouds.",
    "544": "The movie begins with a Sinister Man clicking his heels and giving a swift bow. Brody, in response, removes his hat. The Sinister Man then turns and joins another man, whom Brody and Sallah decide to follow. As they trail, the Second Man overhears Sallah, prompting him and his companion to whirl around swiftly. Sallah, managing Brody's luggage, sets it down and exchanges a glance with Brody before patting his clothing in search of his papers. He then laughs and pulls out a newspaper instead. Brody appears confused by this action. Sallah proceeds to show the newspaper to the Second Man, using it to obscure the Second Man's face momentarily before delivering a surprise punch through the paper.\n\nAs this unfolds, Donovan leads Vogel away, trailed by Nazi Guards. Once they depart, Elsa turns her attention to Indy. She tenderly strokes his face. Meanwhile, Indy and his father Henry remain bound back-to-back. Elsa leans in close to Indy, her whisper reaching Henry's ear as well. She then plants a passionate kiss on Indy's lips, much to Henry's visible disappointment. Vogel soon reappears to remind Elsa of her duties, prompting her departure, though he lingers a moment longer. In a sudden move, Vogel delivers a brutal punch to Indy's jaw, snapping his head aside.\n\nIn their predicament, Indy and Henry frantically attempt to loosen their ropes. Henry manages to maneuver his hand close to Indy's coat pocket, while Indy tries to twist his body towards Henry's reaching fingers. Henry successfully opens a lighter and ignites it, but the flame burns his hand, causing him to yelp and drop the lighter. Desperate, Henry kicks at the lighter on the floor, but fails to reach it. The discarded lighter begins to smolder the rug. As they turn their heads to watch, Indy continues his struggle against the ropes. In his efforts, his foot inadvertently strikes a metal grill, triggering the opening of a Secret Door.\n\nBehind this door, a Nazi Radioman, equipped with headphones, is stationed at a complex panel of dials, switches, and meters, while a Woman plots coordinates on a map. Both have their backs turned to Indy and Henry, who remain tied inside a fireplace. Indy's foot again hits the grill, causing it to open further. Inside, four Nazi Radiomen and the Woman continue their work unperturbed until the Woman notices Indy and Henry. Her scream alerts the others, who draw their guns just as Indy manages to free himself. The Radiomen activate a lever and begin to move through the Secret Door, entering the fireplace but finding no trace of Indy and Henry, who have concealed themselves up the chimney.\n\nFrom their hiding spot, Indy and Henry suddenly drop down behind the Radiomen. In the ensuing chaos, one of the Radiomen seizes Indy by the neck. Their struggle leads them against the rotating wall, and they tumble through to the next room, leaving a startled Henry behind in the fireplace.",
    "545": "In a tense moment, Henry presses against a wall that rotates, leading him into the next room where he encounters a dead Nazi radioman who swivels into view. Other Nazis quickly rush to the scene. Meanwhile, Indy seizes a bust of Hitler and wedges it into the rotating wall, effectively trapping the Nazis within the inferno of the room.\n\nVogel, with purpose in his stride, advances down a hallway, issuing a sharp command that prompts two additional Nazis to join him. Indy grabs his whip, his leather sack, and Henry's case from a nearby table, handing the case to Henry before they both sprint away. They enter an empty room where Henry, visibly horrified by their predicament, watches as Indy frantically searches for an escape route by running his hands over the walls.\n\nIn a sudden twist, Henry sits on a chair that tips backward, striking the wall and triggering the floor beneath Indy to drop away. Indy clings to a railing but ultimately loses his grip, plummeting down a newly formed spiral staircase. Henry follows him down the winding steps, which lead them into a vast watery cavern beneath the mountain that supports the castle. Inside this cavern, they discover a fully operational Nazi boat dock bustling with motorboats, gunboats, and supply boats.\n\nIndy quickly boards a motorboat, starts the engine, and is met with Henry throwing his case at him. In a heated moment, Indy catches the case and tosses it back to his father before returning to the dock to push the boat away. Henry appears confused by the rapid turn of events. Not far behind, Vogel and his Nazi soldiers enter the room, spot the spiral staircase, and hurriedly descend to the dock below. Upon arrival, Vogel notices that a motorboat is missing and immediately orders his soldiers into another boat.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly as a motorbike screeches to a halt. In a moment of frustration, Henry slaps Indy across the face. Nearby, a sign with arrows pointing to Venice and Berlin catches their attention, and the camera focuses on the direction toward Berlin. They proceed to a Nazi rally where a massive book-burning is underway, the pile of burning books reaching ten feet high and growing larger as college students and Nazi Brownshirts continuously feed it. The atmosphere is charged with the rhythmic waving of flags, banners, and swastika standards, contributing to the escalating frenzy of the crowd.\n\nIndy and Henry approach the square, with Indy disguised in a Nazi soldier's uniform, which is oversized and requires buttoning up. They move toward an area where high-ranking officers of the Third Reich, flanking Adolf Hitler, oversee the rally with a commanding presence.",
    "551": "In the heat of battle, a soldier leaps from a truck onto a tank, brandishing a knife as he seizes Indy. The two men engage in a fierce struggle, tumbling off the tank. Dazed, Indy sits up only to find Vogel towering over him, menacingly wrapping a chain around his neck. Moments later, Indy reappears at the tank's entrance, the chain still constricting his neck, with Vogel yanking him back forcefully.\n\nAs a Nazi Soldier approaches, Indy strikes him, sending him crashing onto the tank treads. The soldier's screams pierce the air as he is horrifically dragged under the tank's relentless wheels. Amidst this chaos, Indy and Vogel continue their brutal contest on top of the moving tank, the chain still a tight noose around Indy's neck. In a desperate move, Indy lifts his feet and lunges at the tank's periscope, dragging Vogel with him. Indy's face is momentarily pressed against the periscope's lens, which another Nazi Soldier observes from the other side, pulling away briefly with a smile before resuming his watch.\n\nVogel pulls Indy away from the periscope, and the observing soldier looks away once more. Meanwhile, a troop truck approaches the tank. From within the tank, Henry fires its gun, obliterating the truck and sending soldiers flying through the air. The truck flips and explodes, the blast propelling Indy off the tank and onto its tread. He quickly grabs onto a shredded gun jutting from the tank's side. Above him, Vogel looks down and smirks arrogantly. The tank hurtles toward a cliff wall.\n\nAs Indy attempts to find secure footing, Vogel maliciously stomps on his hands. Inside the tank, Brody exchanges a glance with Henry. Outside, Vogel now swings a shovel at Indy, fiercely targeting his hands. Brody and Henry climb out of the tank but are confronted by another Nazi Soldier who pulls Henry back down. Vogel, relentless, raises the shovel and smashes it down on Indy, who is still clinging to the protruding gun. Indy's grip fails, and he hangs perilously from the gun, supported only by the strap of his leather pouch.\n\nAs the tank scrapes against the cliff wall, stones tumble over Indy, and he screams in agony. Back inside the tank, the Nazi Soldier knocks Henry into a pile of boxes and punches him in the face. As he aims his gun at Henry, Brody intervenes, striking the soldier with a canister. The soldier collapses, his gun discharging into the air. The bullet ricochets wildly inside the tank, sparking and pinging off the window, narrowly missing the Tank Driver at the controls before passing through his hat. Blood trickles from beneath the hat as the driver slumps forward, his body pressing down on the levers.\n\nOutside, Indy remains suspended by the strap of his leather pouch as the tank swerves, narrowly avoiding rocks and causing Vogel to lose his footing and fall.",
    "552": "Indy, after a struggle, finally hoists himself back onto the tank and forcefully knocks Vogel off the side with a punch. He then looks down to see Henry still trapped inside the tank. Indy swiftly pulls both Henry and Brody out of the vehicle. However, Vogel, now armed again with a shovel, climbs back onto the tank and swings at Indy. Indy dodges the attack, grabs Vogel's arm, and in the process of winding up for another punch, accidentally hits Brody in the face with a backswing before successfully knocking Vogel down. Vogel's hat then flies off and lands on the floor.\n\nBefore Indy can react further, Vogel is up again and swinging his shovel. Indy ducks, but the shovel hits Henry, knocking him off the side and onto the tank's moving treads. Indy quickly grabs his whip, knocking Vogel aside, and as Henry speeds perilously towards the front of the tank, Indy, with incredible agility, lashes out his bullwhip, snagging Henry's right ankle just in time.\n\nSallah, riding alongside on his horse, tips his fez to Henry in a respectful gesture. Meanwhile, Vogel punches Indy from behind and tries to choke him, but Indy steadfastly holds onto the whip. Sallah reaches out to Henry, manages to grab him, and skillfully brings his horse to a stop right at the cliff's edge.\n\nIndy frees himself from Vogel's grip by twisting his arm away painfully and then delivers a decisive blow to Vogel's head. As he looks down at the fast-approaching cliff, horror fills Indy's face. His hat is blown off and sails over the cliff's edge. The tank, moments later, tumbles over the cliff and crashes to the bottom, exploding into a fiery wreck. Henry, Brody, and Sallah gaze down at the flaming remains. Indy, looking dazed and bewildered, staggers up behind them, joining them at the cliff's edge to look down at the wreckage below, his expression filled with bewilderment.\n\nHenry finally notices Indy's presence, overcome with emotion, and throws his arms around him. Indy, feeling his father's embrace, hugs him back. Brody and Sallah are moved by this sudden reconciliation. Henry pats Indy on the back, and Indy, overwhelmed, collapses and sits hard on the rocky cliff edge. Unaware, Henry, Sallah, and Brody start to walk away, with Henry turning towards a horse with Brody and Sallah. Suddenly, a fedora, carried by the wind, blows into the scene and lands at Indy's feet.\n\nMeanwhile, Donovan, peering through binoculars, views the Canyon of the Crescent Moon. He lowers the binoculars and turns to Elsa, who then takes her turn to look through them. Indy, Henry, Sallah, and Brody ride into the canyon and, after turning a corner, they come upon the sight of the hidden city.",
    "555": "As agony twists his face, he clutches his stomach and turns toward Elsa. Suddenly, he begins to age rapidly; his hair lengthens, turns gray, and becomes brittle. Shocked, Elsa gasps and screams. His skin transforms into a brown, leathery texture, stretching tightly over his bones until it splits. With skeletal hands, he reaches out and chokes Elsa. Indy swiftly intervenes, shoving the man away. As he falls, his body ignites in flames and shatters against the wall.\n\nIndy then examines an assortment of chalices and selects a simple earthenware jug. He exchanges a significant look with Elsa before heading to the well to fill the jug with water. He pauses momentarily, then brings the jug to his lips, taking several large swallows. Together, Indy and Elsa approach with the Grail, astonishing the two Nazi soldiers who stand in awe.\n\nKneeling beside Henry, Indy tilts his head forward and holds the Grail to his lips. Weak and unable to open his eyes, Henry manages to swallow some of the water, though much of it trickles down the sides of his mouth. Indy then pours the water over Henry's wound, and as everyone watches in amazement, the wound and the bloodstain vanish. Color floods back into Henry's face, and his eyes open. The first sight that greets him is the Grail, sparking joy in his eyes, which intensifies when his gaze shifts to Indy's face.\n\nThe Nazi soldiers, overwhelmed, rush forward, drop their weapons, and surrender by raising their arms. Elsa steps forward, picks up the Grail, and her face glows with its possession. She moves to the edge of the Great Seal, but a rumbling sound fills the air as the ground shakes and shifts, causing dirt to fall from the cavern's ceiling. Elsa stumbles on the Great Seal, and the Grail slips from her grasp. As she reaches for it, the ground beneath her splits open, and she slides into the crevasse. Indy catches one of her hands as he slides forward across the slanted floor. Desperately, Elsa reaches for the Grail with her free hand, but Indy needs both her hands to save her. As her grip begins to slip, the ledge Indy lies on starts to break apart. Henry grabs one of Indy's hands, while Indy reaches for the Grail with the other. Realizing the peril, Indy abandons the Grail and grabs Henry with both hands, who then pulls him to safety.\n\nThrough the falling debris, Sallah and Brody rush out from the crumbling Temple, seeking safety.",
    "557": "In a cluttered study filled with books, Professor Henry Jones is deeply engrossed at his desk, studying an ancient parchment volume that lies open before him. The page reveals a beautifully illuminated picture, resembling a stained-glass window, complete with a series of Roman numerals. Not merely observing, Professor Jones meticulously copies the image into his notebook, his hand deftly sketching until he pauses, holding up one finger in thought. As he stands to leave, closing the study door behind him, the sound of a trumpet playing interrupts the quiet. Herman, still blowing into the instrument, enters through the front door. Indy, reaching out, forcefully pulls the trumpet from Herman’s mouth, only to receive a spit in the face in response. Moments later, the Sheriff, meant by Herman, enters the house. Indy, in an attempt to make a point, hands over what appears to be a Cross to the Sheriff, who takes it nonchalantly.\n\nSoon after, Fedora, accompanied by Roscoe, Rough Rider, and Halfbreed, steps into the house. Fedora respectfully removes his hat and holds it in his hand. In a coordinated move, the Sheriff hands the Cross to Fedora, who promptly has it taken by Roscoe. Roscoe then dashes out the door with the Cross. Fedora lingers briefly, turning to speak to Indy with an ironic, man-to-man tone before placing his hat, a symbol of respect and admiration, onto Indy’s head. The hat covers Indy's face, its brim eventually filling the screen. As the brim lifts, it reveals the face of the now full-grown Indiana Jones.\n\nSuddenly, Indiana Jones is punched in the face, his arms pinned behind him. The Man in the Panama Hat, aged since their last encounter, removes the Cross of Coronado from Indy's belt. It's night, and rain pours down amidst a violent storm at sea. Thirty-foot waves crash across the deck where two Portuguese sailors, holding Indy’s arms, push him toward the rail. As they pass a bundle of fuel drums, Indy uses the sailors for leverage, kicking up his feet to break the clamp on the metal bands holding the drums. He then jabs his elbows into the sailors’ stomachs, breaking free to rush towards the Man in the Panama Hat. Seeing Indy's approach, the Man in the Panama Hat hurries up a ladder towards the bridge. Despite the crashing waves, Indy pursues, catching up to the ladder where the Man in the Panama Hat is climbing. Indy successfully reclaims the Cross from him, only for a sailor to deliver a powerful blow to Indy's face, causing the Cross to fly from his grip and skitter across the deck.",
    "559": "Donovan confidently strides across the room towards Indy, exuding power in his tuxedo. He extends his hand for a firm handshake with Indy. Moving to a nearby table, Donovan dramatically unveils a cloth-covered object, revealing a flat stone tablet approximately two feet square. The tablet, inscribed with ancient letters and symbols, catches Donovan's keen interest as he dons his glasses for a meticulous examination. As Indy peruses the tablet, Donovan pours champagne into several fluted glasses. Suddenly, Indy pauses, his expression startled as he looks up at Donovan. Accepting a glass of champagne from Donovan, Indy rubs his chin, his face reflecting doubt.\n\nAt the mention of his father, Indy stiffens slightly but nods in acknowledgment. The atmosphere shifts as Mrs. Donovan, a matronly figure adorned in an opulent evening gown, enters the room. Donovan greets her affectionately with a kiss on the cheek. Mrs. Donovan, perhaps feeling out of place, sighs softly and rejoins the ongoing party. Meanwhile, Indy's attention is recaptured by the Grail Tablet, his interest piqued by its archaeological significance. Using his champagne-moistened finger, he gently rubs the surface of the tablet. Donovan steps closer to Indy, whose expression conveys disapproval at Donovan's seemingly reckless approach.\n\nProducing an ancient, leather-bound volume with brittle pages, Donovan presents it to Indy, who examines the manuscript with notable interest. The scene shifts as a Ford coupe races down a tree-lined street, pulling up in front of a house. Indy quickly exits the vehicle and hurries up the walkway, followed closely by Brody. Noticing the front door ajar, they exchange concerned glances before entering. Indy approaches the partially open door, pushing it further to step inside and call out.\n\nInside, Indy pulls back one curtain separating the hall from the sitting room, revealing the ransacked state of the house. Brody, observing Indy's reaction, opens the other curtain. They move into the room, where Brody picks up some mail from Henry's cluttered desk. Indy spots a pile of torn papers and envelopes. Prompted by this, he empties his own pockets, revealing mail collected earlier from his college office, and discovers an envelope with a Venice postmark.\n\nContinuing his investigation, Indy finds a small book that appears to be a journal or diary, filled with handwritten notes and sketches. Brody peers at it with great curiosity. As Indy ponders aloud, he turns to a painting on the wall depicting Christ on the Cross, with His blood being collected in a golden chalice. Nearby, another painting shows Eleventh Century Crusaders falling to their deaths off a high cliff, except for one who safely floats in midair, holding the Grail in his hands.",
    "561": "In a tense moment within a library, a man named Indy blows dust off a tile and attempts to dislodge it, but initially fails. He then hastily moves past Brody, rushing to a brass stand positioned under a stained-glass window. With precise timing, Indy lifts the brass stand and strikes the tile just as the Librarian stamps a book, catching the Librarian's attention and sparking his curiosity about the echoing sound.\n\nDespite the Librarian's puzzled looks and continued stamping, Indy relentlessly pounds at the tile until it finally breaks apart. Bending down to clear away the fragments, Indy uncovers a two-foot square hole. Impressed by Elsa's daring spirit, Indy cooperatively holds her hands and lowers her into the hole. Once her feet touch the ground below, Indy releases his grip on her and discreetly hands the Grail Diary to Brody before descending into the hole himself.\n\nInside, Indy jumps down a steep step and reaches back to assist Elsa. Together, they survey their dimly lit, damp surroundings. Elsa pulls out a cigarette lighter adorned with an ivory four-leaf clover design. Using this, they examine markings etched into the walls. Indy borrows the lighter to lead them through a dark passageway.\n\nMeanwhile, three armed men, including Kazim, descend a spiral staircase toward an unsuspecting Brody. Kazim violently strikes Brody on the head with his gun. Indy, with a quick glance at the situation, takes the lighter and leads Elsa into another dark corridor. He touches the wall, running his hand over the stone surface, before forcefully ramming his shoulder into it. The wall gives way, collapsing as Indy tumbles into another room, landing amidst rocks surrounded by a bubbling, green, slimy liquid. Skeletons rest in carved niches around him.\n\nElsa, holding the lighter, peers through the newly formed hole in the wall at Indy. He reaches up, tearing a piece of cloth from one of the skeletons, which disintegrates and falls into the oily water below. Indy fashions a makeshift torch from the cloth and a bone, dipping it into the oil-slick water to light it. Guided by this torch, Indy and Elsa navigate a narrow passageway filled with knee-deep water teeming with rats. The rodents crawl over each other, thrashing in the water, causing Elsa to gasp as they scamper between her legs. As Indy advances through the rat-infested water with Elsa following, still gasping in horror, he suddenly slips into a hole. Quickly regaining his balance, he reaches out to Elsa for support.",
    "565": "Edgar forcefully pushes Laurel out through the driver's door of the cab, closely following her while maintaining his weapon's aim on her. Left behind on the front seat, the postcard he has been carrying now reveals its front. Meanwhile, Jay urgently lifts the plastic cover and decisively presses the red flashing button. As the LTD accelerates toward the looming traffic jam, it undergoes a transformation, morphing into a larger, more wiry machine, its structure supported by an intricate network of mechanical muscles and metallic tendons.\n\nKay's vehicle, now transformed, hurtles dangerously close to a fatal collision with the traffic jam but miraculously veers off at the last second with a distinct sucking sound emanating from beneath. Instead of crashing into the tunnel wall, the LTD astonishingly adheres to it. It maneuvers upward onto the wall, clings there, and races past the traffic below. Continuing its astonishing journey, it flips over completely and drives upside down, its wheels gripping the tunnel's roof. Jay, dislodged from his seat with a loud clunk, finds himself on the car's inverted ceiling. Curled up and peering out the window, he watches as they speed through the tunnel, zooming over the congested traffic beneath.\n\nEdgar momentarily loses his hold on Laurel, and she seizes the opportunity to hurl herself out into the air. Edgar's desperate flailing fails to reach her as she tumbles through the air and lands amidst the branches of a tree. She strikes the branches hard, causing them to shake, and desperately clings to them, suspended high above the ground. Above her, Edgar continues his relentless climb.\n\nAt the fairgrounds, the LTD comes to a long, skidding halt near a fence. At the trunk, Jay and Kay hurriedly open it and grab the most lethal-looking weapons they can find. Kay snatches a black box, unsnaps a series of latches, and opens it to unveil a formidable, three-foot-long, triple-barreled shotgun with an over-and-under-and-under configuration, equipped with a pump action reloader and a storage clip for twelve additional, steel-glistening shells. Kay methodically loads the clip.\n\nSuddenly, a vacuum whump sound, akin to all the surrounding air being sucked into a dime-sized space, erupts, followed by a massive shock wave emanating from the gun barrels. The bizarre force sends Jay and Kay crashing to the ground onto their stomachs as if pulled by a magnetic force. The shock waves ripple across the open space toward the ship, and upon impact, the ship, too, is forcefully pulled back down.",
    "566": "As six additional Men in Black, clad in dark suits and sunglasses, emerge over the hill, Agent Kay swiftly issues them commands. He then brandishes a neuralyzer, capturing the attention of the Agents who examine it intently. Kay, donning his own sunglasses, activates the device with a button press, unleashing a blinding flash that lasts a mere tenth of a second, leaving the Agents momentarily disoriented and staring blankly.\n\nIn the aftermath, Kay points out the Men in Black using fire extinguishers to extinguish fires they had previously ignited. Amidst the confusion, the Agents look around bewildered. Meanwhile, Dee, having distanced himself from the group, sits on a rock, gazing at the starry night sky, his sunglasses hanging loosely from his hand. Kay approaches, joins him on the rock, and shares a moment of silence as they both look up at the countless stars above. Kay then retrieves his neuralyzer, examining it thoughtfully.\n\nThe scene shifts to James Edwards, a New York City cop dressed in undercover street clothes, racing ahead of two other officers struggling to keep pace. Edwards, demonstrating superior speed, is hot on the trail of a man, later identified as the Perpetrator, whose feet are seen sprinting across the screen. Their chase leads them onto a bridge crossing Park Avenue in the low Forties.\n\nThe Perpetrator suddenly veers left and, without hesitation, leaps over a guard rail into a thirty-foot drop to Forty-first Street below. Edwards, taken aback but quick to react, follows suit, landing on a double-decker tourist bus crammed with Japanese tourists, many of whom are filming the incident. Pushing through the crowd, Edwards flashes his badge, poised to arrest the Perpetrator.\n\nJust as Edwards is about to handcuff him, the Perpetrator blinks, momentarily distracting Edwards. This brief hesitation allows the Perpetrator to draw a bizarre-looking weapon. Edwards swiftly knocks the gun from his hand, causing it to crash against Central Park's stone wall and shatter into countless fragments. The Perpetrator retaliates by kicking Edwards in the groin, then quickly gets up and resumes his escape. Edwards, in pain, staggers after him.\n\nThe chase continues as the Perpetrator leaps over a moving car, heading towards the Guggenheim Museum. Edwards attempts to pursue, but a bus obstructs his path. By the time it passes, the Perpetrator has vanished from sight.",
    "567": "The Perp, having leapt an impressive twenty feet, soared past a bystander and landed on the roof of the Guggenheim. He scrambled up, crunching onto the gravel surface, then dashed to the front door of the Museum. He shot the lock and burst inside, running up the grand ramp of the rotunda. Desperately, he leapt to his feet and raced to a nearby door, but found it locked. He tugged at another door—also locked. In a frantic move, he scrambled up and over a ledge to a third door, which swung open to reveal EDWARDS, breathing heavily and aiming his weapon at the Perp. After a tense moment of decision, the Perp plummeted to his death, screaming as he fell.\n\nMeanwhile, Edgar, every bit the nasty, bug-eyed redneck his voice suggested, carrying a twelve-gauge shotgun, stumbled across his yard in shock. His mouth agape, he stared at the smoldering remains of his truck, a huge hole extending ten feet into the ground.\n\nIn another scene, a woman, DOCTOR LAUREL WEAVER, in her thirties with a dark aura about her, looking as if she had just been dragged from bed after encountering a spaceman, sneaked into a room. She whispered to someone, casting a cautious glance over her shoulder. Edwards, twisting in his chair for a better view, only saw Laurel facing someone in the hallway. As the person spoke, Laurel stepped forward, moving out of Edwards's sight. Stretching further in his seat, Edwards was suddenly blinded by a flash from the corridor. Intensely curious, he started to rise but was interrupted by KAY, who entered the room and shut the door behind him.\n\nEdwards paused as he approached the door, only to be met by the INSPECTOR, who peeked in, smiled, and gave him a thumbs up. Edwards looked between the Inspector and Kay, then followed as Kay opened the car door and stepped out. They found themselves in front of a pawn shop. Inside, Edwards casually knocked some Rolexes off the counter. At the sound of Kay's voice, Jeebs paled with fear. Kay then drew his gun, aiming it at Jeebs' forehead. Seeing Kay's progress, Edwards joined in the action. Suddenly, with a loud KA-BOOM, Kay shot Jeebs, whose head exploded and body crumpled to the floor.",
    "571": "The LTD comes to a halt at the end of the driveway leading to Beatrice's farmhouse, the site where the alien ship had previously landed. Nearby, a wrecked pickup truck remains stationary. JAY and KAY exit the vehicle, their demeanor that of undercover cops. JAY begins to walk up the driveway, while KAY retrieves a black card from his wallet, presenting it to Beatrice as she approaches. Beatrice appears revitalized since their last encounter, sporting nicer clothes, a hint of makeup, and a smile.\n\nInside the farmhouse, in the living room, JAY takes a sip of Beatrice's lemonade and grimaces slightly. A soft giggle escapes Beatrice as she recalls a pleasant thought. Meanwhile, in the hole left by the landed ship, KAY is busy investigating. He uses a pocket spectral analyzer over a patch of scorched earth. Above, JAY leans over, peering down at KAY, who looks up at him. The analyzer's display shifts through colors—red, yellow, purple, and finally green.\n\nSuddenly, DR. LAUREL WEAVER, previously seen attempting to speak with JAY, appears. She signs a clipboard and gives JAY a disapproving look, which he responds to with laughter before departing. Laurel then moves to a stretcher, gently petting Rosenberg's cat. She notices JAY and KAY standing nearby, rises, and approaches the Arquillian's body, which is laid out on a table under bright lights. She pulls back a sheet, unveiling the fully dissected Arquillian to JAY and KAY.\n\nJAY starts examining the Arquillian while Laurel and JAY move across the room to Rosenberg's corpse, which lies on another gurney. Laurel snaps on a rubber glove and reaches down, out of view, manipulating the insides of the body. JAY's expression reveals his disgust at the sight. From the opposite side of the room, KAY clears his throat and walks over to continue examining the Arquillian. JAY rushes back to join Laurel.\n\nJAY leans in closer to Rosenberg's corpse and notices unusual stitching around the base of his ear. He touches the ear and turns it, hearing a soft sound as it detaches from the head. Inside, a gravely wounded Tiny Little Green Man is revealed. JAY pulls further, causing Rosenberg's face to mechanically hum and hinge open, revealing a control room inside the skull filled with gearshifts and viewing screens. A Baltian, controlling the body, staggers out of the control room, nodding vigorously in acknowledgment before nodding again, falling, and succumbing to death.\n\nMeanwhile, KAY and JAY are distracted and fail to notice Laurel. Without even glancing her way, KAY swiftly uses his neuralyzer to erase her memory with a flash.",
    "584": "As the plane levels out, Trina is thrown across the galley. The aircraft's gauges plummet as the pilot, Whip, maneuvers the aircraft towards a church on a vast open field. In a close call, Whip steers clear of the church's steeple, yet the wing clips it. The plane then crashes onto the ground. Debris flies past the cockpit, striking Whip's head and rendering him unconscious.\n\nRegaining semi-consciousness with blurred vision, Whip sees Ken slumped in his seat being dragged out of the wreckage. Nearby, Margaret lies dead beside Trina, her head fatally crushed by a fallen bulkhead. As Whip is pulled from the wreckage, smoke obstructs his view while individuals in white robes assist the other passengers. A fire engine soon arrives on the scene. Whip, now on the ground, looks up to see a female EMT attending to him before turning his gaze to the black smoke emanating from the crash site. The church's spire, broken off during the incident, lies at a distance where an ambulance operates and rescue workers aid survivors.\n\nIn the hospital, Whip, with his right eye slowly opening and the other covered by a bandage, watches a TV where a man gestures and rescue workers move a stretcher past. A Channel 12 News reporter gives a live commentary from the crash site, with lights flickering in the background. On the television, cell phone footage captures the plane's descent, showing it swerving, slicing off the church's steeple, flying overhead with both engines ablaze, and finally crashing onto its side as people in white robes scatter for safety.\n\nWrapped in gauze, Whip watches in a daze as the church congregation stands, observing the aftermath before slowly approaching. Averting his eyes from the screen, he notices a man in the room, intently focused on his cell phone, dressed in a suit with the collar open. Whip smiles as the man, Charlie, turns towards him. Soon after, an NTSB officer, accompanied by law enforcement, a nurse, and a doctor, enters the room. The NTSB officer sets a recorder on Whip's bed, to which Whip gives a weak nod. The doctor and the others, including the NTSB officer named Craig, leave the room, but Charlie remains. Charlie smiles and reaches for a plastic bag before departing.\n\nOverwhelmed, Whip covers his mouth with his bandaged hand, tears streaming down his face. Shaking his head, he retrieves his cell phone from the plastic bag and drops it onto his stomach. Meanwhile, a heavy-set man with a goatee, clad in Bermuda shorts and dark glasses with earphone wires visible, enters the hospital. Carrying a bag in hand and another over his shoulder, he strides down the corridors, eventually stopping at the reception desk to remove his earphones and lean forward to speak.",
    "586": "A man opens a freezer, discovers a bottle of vodka, and promptly pours it down the sink. He then removes a bulging plastic trash bag from the trash can and carries it outside to a shed. Upon sliding open the shed doors, he unveils a two-seat Cessna plane housed within a small hangar. He removes a blanket covering the plane's windshield and activates the lights. His gaze then shifts to a collection of photographs displayed above a workstation in the hangar, where he delicately extracts a photo of a young African American boy from a frame and kisses it affectionately.\n\nLater, he pulls a bottle of liquor from a bowling bag and discards it. He holds a framed wedding photo of himself and his wife, reminiscing for a moment before settling down to watch the news that evening. The following day, at a hotel lobby, the man, named Whip, walks with a cane; his large eye patch is gone, replaced by visible stitches around his eye. He proceeds to a dining area where a buffet is set up and approaches Charlie, who is seated with another man wearing glasses. Hugh, at the table, peruses a file while Whip examines a document in front of him, his eyes narrowing in concentration before he decides to leave. Stopping briefly in the bar area, Whip notices his photo displayed on the TV behind the bar.\n\nSeating himself at the bar, Whip manipulates a cocktail napkin and scrutinizes a glass of vodka. He lifts the glass, takes a sip, smacks his lips appreciatively, then drains the rest of the contents. Later, he places a case of Budweiser on the passenger seat of his car, gets in, unscrews a gallon bottle of vodka, looks around cautiously, and begins to chug it. Groggy-eyed and clutching a beer can, Whip drives down a street until he reaches a dead-end and halts. He observes Nicole loading items into the back of a car, briefly looks away, then watches her run back through a worn fence.\n\nWhip drives up to the apartment entrance right behind Nicole's car, passing her belongings and noticing a few enlarged photographs in a basket. He takes a sip of his beer, suddenly alert, and proceeds towards the apartment. Inside, he forcefully pushes Fran to the floor. A brief exchange follows where Nicole nods in acknowledgment, and Whip takes out some money, looking at Nicole for a moment before nodding in agreement.\n\nSeated in the passenger seat of Whip's car as he drives and drinks his beer, Nicole bites her thumb nervously. When offered a beer by Whip, she refuses. Whip lights a cigarette, and Nicole, fidgeting slightly, smiles to herself as she observes him driving.",
    "590": "Whip surveys the assortment of spirits and opts for vodka. While still kneeling, he removes the bottle's cap, feeling the cold glass beneath his fingers. He sniffs the vodka, then replaces the cap, stands up leisurely, and places the bottle atop the refrigerator before shutting the door and departing. Later, he snatches the bottle back up.\n\nElsewhere, Charlie steps out of an elevator with three coffees in hand, followed by Hugh. Edmonds gives a knock, prompting the men to exchange glances. Hugh checks the time as they observe bottles scattered everywhere.\n\nIn the bathroom, Whip lies face down beside the toilet, surrounded by a large blood stain. Harling arrives with a bag over his shoulder, causing Hugh to jump back and Charlie to raise his hands. Harling motions towards Edmonds. Hugh clears a space on the table, and Harling takes a seat beside Whip, cutting cocaine as Whip smiles up at him. A piece of toilet paper with a blood spot hangs over Whip's eye.\n\nHugh fetches water as Harling prepares a cigarette. Whip drinks and Harling, after sucking on the cigarette, passes it to Whip. Harling continues to cut more lines of cocaine, snorts one, and offers it to Charlie and Hugh. Whip nods in acknowledgment.\n\nWhip heads into the bathroom, and Harling dons his sunglasses. Whip exits the room sporting sunglasses, a Band-Aid on his forehead, and wearing a suit. Charlie and Hugh trail him into an elevator where they join a woman and a little girl. The girl stares at Whip as Hugh passes him a handkerchief. Whip tilts his head back and presses the cloth to his nostril, then removes his glasses to check his reflection on the elevator's ceiling before lowering his gaze to the little girl.\n\nIn the hearing room, cell phone footage of a plane crash plays on a large screen until it concludes. Whip shifts uncomfortably in his seat and sips water. Ellen, managing the proceedings, presses a remote, stands up, and circles the table at the front of the room. She projects an image onto two massive screens and faces Whip in the center of the room. Wearing her glasses, Ellen reviews her notes as Whip exchanges glances with Hugh and Charlie. The evidence flashes across the screens while Ellen nods and flips through a file. Charlie and Hugh exchange a look.\n\nWhip's attention fixes on an enlarged photograph of Katerina displayed on the screen. He rolls his tongue, his gaze momentarily meeting Hugh and Charlie's before returning to Katerina's smiling face, his lips pressed together. He takes another sip of water as Ellen nods. Whip looks firmly at Ellen, his face glistening with sweat. His eyes feel heavy as he looks down. Ellen closes her file and walks slowly back to her seat.",
    "593": "In the infirmary, a visibly anxious Slughorn occupies a chair. Ron, finally regaining consciousness, sits up only to weakly slump back onto the floor. Ginny and Hermione are stationed beside Ron's bed, where Madam Pomfrey diligently monitors his temperature. As a contingent of staff, including McGonagall, Dumbledore, and Snape, enter the room, Harry turns to watch them. Lavender bursts in, quickly noticing Hermione at Ron's side. Leaning closer to observe, Lavender's face hardens before she dashes out of the room, just as Hermione reassuringly takes Ron's hand. The professors soon depart, followed by Ginny's attention shifting to Harry. Madam Pomfrey exits next, leaving Hermione to catch Harry's eye; they share a subtle smile before Harry, the last to leave, exits the ward. Hermione, now seated on Ron's bed, tightens her grip on his hand, exhaling a sigh of contentment.\n\nMeanwhile, the silhouette of someone ascending stairs is projected against a wall. Harry, ascending the spiral staircase, glimpses through an archway to identify Draco Malfoy. He moves closer, observes briefly, then tails Draco. Draco proceeds along the upper corridor, where a birdcage, now holding only one bird, is suspended. He pauses, closes his eyes, and when Harry reaches the corner, Draco has vanished. Inside a cluttered room, Draco is seen with a heavy cloth from a cabinet, also holding the missing bird. He encloses the bird within the cabinet, plucking a feather from his cuff and examining it under the light. Upon reopening the cabinet, the bird has disappeared. Later, rain drenches the Borgin and Burkes shop sign. Through a grimy arched window at the back, a faint light illuminates a triangular cabinet, securely shut. Draco, nervously, opens his cabinet to discover the bird dead inside. He stares at its motionless form, his face contorted in a frown, then breaks down in sobs.\n\nIn the great hall, Lavender fixes a stern gaze on Ron, who sits beside Hermione, clutching his wand as snowflakes begin to flutter down. Ron appears confused as he, along with Hermione and Harry, notice Lavender lifting her chin and clenching her teeth in defiance. Harry's eyes dart between Ron and Hermione, observing their reactions. Hermione averts her gaze downward.\n\nHarry, reading a note scribbled in his advanced potion book, suddenly rises to his feet, grabs the book, and strides purposefully up the hall towards Katie. She peers over his shoulder, her gaze fixed. Turning, Harry catches sight of Draco watching them. Draco retreats, turns away, and exits as Harry follows suit. Katie departs with a friend as Harry marches determinedly down the great hall. Draco ascends the stairs, while Harry pushes through a cluster of students, not far behind. Draco briskly walks the upstairs corridor, passing the now-empty birdcage, and hurries into the boys' lavatory. There, he loosens his tie, removes his sweater, turns on a tap, and scrutinizes his distressed reflection in the mirror.",
    "594": "Harry's disheveled hair frames his face as he splashes water on his ashen complexion. From the doorway, he observes Draco sobbing. Suddenly, Draco draws his wand and casts a spell, prompting an immediate response from Harry. Draco casts another spell as they both seek cover behind the cubicles. Draco briefly appears, then ducks back out of sight. Harry cautiously peeks out, catching his reflection in a mirror. The two of them crawl across the floor, peeking underneath the cubicles. Draco's spell misses its mark. Rising, Harry aims his wand at Draco, who stumbles backward and falls into water pooling on the floor from a burst pipe. With his potions book in one hand and his wand in the other, Harry slowly walks past the cubicles. Rounding a corner, he finds Draco sprawled on his back. Shocked, Harry stumbles forward, noticing blood seeping into the water and staining Draco's white shirt. Snape strides in, brushing past Harry to stand over Draco. He glares at Harry, who averts his gaze and leaves. Snape kneels beside Draco; the blood recedes and the stains on his shirt disappear.\n\nIn the Gryffindor common room, Harry's potions book lies on the table before him. Silhouetted against the light from a lead-paned window, Ginny, Hermione, and Ron stand. Ginny approaches and sits beside Harry, who nods in acknowledgment. Standing in front of the unicorn tapestry, Harry firmly grasps Ginny's outstretched hand. They enter a cluttered room, their reflections visible in the mirror behind them. Wandering through the Room of Requirement, they hear a sound from a cabinet covered with heavy cloth. As Harry approaches, he notices a gap in the cloth where he sees a door. A bird flies out and lands on a stone shelf. Harry gazes at Ginny as she moves close to him, and they share a long look. She glances at his book, taking it from his hand. Harry keeps looking at her as she steps back, and he closes his eyes, standing rooted to the spot, breathing shallowly. Swallowing hard, he keeps his eyes shut. Ginny returns, steps close to Harry, and gently kisses him on the lips. He responds, then smiles and opens his eyes, but Ginny has disappeared. Lost in thought, Harry walks slowly down a corridor. Ron approaches as Professor Slughorn stops in front of them and then hurries away.\n\nBack in the common room, under the watchful eyes of Hermione and Ron, Harry uncorks a vial of Liquid Luck and drinks its contents. As he stares into the distance, they stand and look at him. Harry grins and turns to them as he passes other students. Hermione and Ron appear confused. Meanwhile, a greenhouse window is forced open, and Slughorn's head appears.",
    "596": "The movie begins with waves forcefully crashing against a towering pinnacle and the rugged coastline. This scene is reminiscent of the craggy cliff depicted on Tom Riddle's postcard. Dark clouds loom ominously in the background while spray and spume are flung over the area. Dumbledore, his hair and beard wildly tossed by the fierce wind, keeps his gaze fixed on an inverted V-shaped fissure in the cliff face.\n\nInside a rocky cavern, Dumbledore sharpens a knife against a stone before decisively piercing his own right hand with it. Harry, witnessing the act, looks at the wound with concern. Dumbledore then smears his bloodied hand across the rock face, causing it to crumble. Stepping back to join Harry, they observe the effect. With their wands serving as torches, they proceed into a tunnel that was previously hidden.\n\nAs they advance, they reach a lake, gazing out over its dark surface where their wands' reflections shimmer. Dumbledore sends a ball of light skimming across the lake; it rises, falls, and then flares brightly, revealing a small island in the distance. He steps onto a half-submerged crystalline rock and extends his left hand over the water, which begins to bubble and churn. Something stirs within the frothy waters, and suddenly a chain leaps into Dumbledore's grasp. He hands the chain to Harry, who starts pulling, and soon the carved prow of a small boat emerges from the water. With greater vigor, Harry hauls the boat towards them.\n\nThe boat slowly transports them across the still water to the island. Upon reaching it, they climb onto the translucent rock. There, a dip in a rock pedestal holds a crystal basin filled with a shimmering liquid. Dumbledore passes his hand over the surface, then, startled, looks up. He uses a large shell as a cup to scoop up the liquid and drinks it, shuddering as he opens his eyes after draining it. Weakened, Dumbledore steps back from the basin and sits down with difficulty, covering his ear with his now blackened right hand.\n\nHarry takes over, picking up the shell and returning to the basin to scoop more liquid. He assists Dumbledore in drinking, filling the shell repeatedly and persistently forcing the liquid into Dumbledore's mouth. As the basin nears emptiness, Dumbledore, with half-closed eyes, reluctantly opens his mouth to accept more liquid. Finally, with the basin almost empty, Dumbledore opens his eyes wide and smacks his lips, while Harry steps back holding the empty shell.\n\nHarry then returns to the basin, where he finds and lifts a locket and chain lying at the bottom, subsequently raising his wand in readiness.",
    "597": "Water fills a basin as Harry, in desperation, tries to scoop it with a shell that refuses to fill. Turning away, he gazes at the nearby lake, then stumbles over rocks toward the water. Bracing himself with a rock, he stretches down with the shell. Meanwhile, Dumbledore's ball of light descends beneath the surface, plunging them into darkness. Harry, wielding his wand, makes its tip glow. Clenching his teeth and using the hand that steadies him on the rock, he leans forward to dip the shell into the lake, filling it to the brim. Suddenly, a bony hand emerges from the water, grabbing his arm. Harry wrestles free as the water around the island begins to seethe ominously. The light intensifies, revealing emaciated corpses crawling from the water toward him. He strikes out at them as they swarm the small island. Dumbledore, in a feeble attempt, reaches for his wand. Harry is dragged under the water, where a corpse wraps its arms around him from behind. As they sink, Harry sees balls of fire streaking through the water above. The creature releases him, allowing Harry to surface inside a circle of fire. Dumbledore stands, flourishing his wand around his head to whip up the flames, causing the corpses to retreat. Harry returns to the island and assists Dumbledore back to their boat. The flames part, revealing a clear channel of water ahead.\n\nIn another scene, Draco Malfoy lies awake in bed before rising. The lights at Borgin and Burkes shop go out as Bellatrix leads a group through the courtyard to a room at the rear. She opens the door of an embossed cabinet. Meanwhile, Filch stands guard on the school's battlements. Draco marches unnoticed through a corridor while Professor McGonagall leans out of a stone archway, anxiously scanning the menacing clouds above. Snape also looks out into the brewing storm. In the Room of Requirement, Draco removes a heavy cloth from a cabinet, steps back, and observes as the door handle turns and the cabinet opens, releasing black smoke. Draco quickly walks away as Bellatrix, Greyback, and two Death Eaters with metal masks emerge from the smoke. Bellatrix smirks.\n\nAt the astronomy tower, Harry walks away but stops, turning to look back at Dumbledore. He hides as a figure passes on the stairs, climbing to the upper platform and pointing a wand at Dumbledore. Harry watches from below as Draco reveals the Death Eater mark on his arm. Dumbledore's wand falls, and Harry, still concealed, sees Bellatrix, Greyback, and the two Death Eaters race to the upper platform. Bellatrix faces Dumbledore while Draco keeps his wand raised. Snape, unnoticed by Harry, is right behind him and then enters the upper platform.",
    "599": "Upon entering a house, Dumbledore, gripping his wand in his unscathed left hand, and Harry discover chaos: the front door is dislodged from its hinges, the house is in disarray, pictures hang askew, and a door frame bears scratches. As they proceed into the sitting room, they find the furniture overturned and the room utterly ravaged. \n\nHarry, engrossed in examining a piece of paper, is startled when a drop of blood falls onto it. Looking up, he notices the ceiling where plaster has crumbled, exposing bloodied rafters, and feels another drop land on his forehead. Dumbledore delicately wipes the blood from Harry's forehead and tastes it, his gaze sweeping the room suspiciously. His attention is drawn to an overstuffed armchair; he approaches it cautiously, followed by Harry, and probes it with his wand, revealing a man in disguise who spots Harry.\n\nWith a swift motion of his wand, Dumbledore begins restoring the room. Shards of glass fly towards a broken chandelier, which magically reassembles and rehangs itself. A vinyl disk finds its way back to a record player, books return to their shelves, and a grand piano corrects itself. The ceiling repairs itself, the missing plaster regenerating, prompting a smile from Harry, who then notices a piece of the chandelier under his shoe. He lifts his foot, and the piece soars to its proper place.\n\nIn the now tidied room, Horace Slughorn, dressed in pajamas made from upholstery fabric, grins at Harry. Harry then moves to a display of moving photographs, watching as some figures within raise their glasses in a toast. As Dumbledore departs, Harry exchanges a glance with Slughorn before following him out.\n\nWalking down the path, they are soon joined by Slughorn. In the street, Dumbledore extends his arm, and Harry, bracing himself, prepares to apparate. A cloud of dust marks their departure, and Harry finds himself alone, landing in a stream. Shaking off water from his trainers, he trudges through a reed bed until he spots the familiar Weasley house, a smile forming on his face as he sees Ginny at an upstairs window. She comes downstairs, spots his trunk and white owl, and rushes to him on the stairs. They share a warm embrace, their eyes locked as they pull apart. Hermione then rushes up, and Ron tenderly touches her cheek, as Harry observes them both with interest.\n\nThe trio later gathers, sitting on the floor around a tray placed on a stool.\n\nMeanwhile, in a grim and wet part of town, Narcissa Malfoy, accompanied by Bellatrix Lestrange, navigates a narrow alley. They pause to let children on bicycles pass before Narcissa steps onto a street and knocks on a door. The two women stand in the rain, waiting until Wormtail, a round-faced man, greets them at the door and ushers them into Severus Snape's study.",
    "601": "Harry rises from his seat. He retrieves an item from the overhead luggage rack, exits the compartment, and proceeds down the corridor, concealing the item behind him. Outside, the train chugs through an expansive, sunlit brown landscape as evening sets in. Harry pauses to allow two girls to pass and notices Draco in a carriage with open seating on either side. A contemplative expression crosses Harry's face as he glances at the Peruvian Darkness Powder in his hand. Abruptly, darkness envelops the carriage.\n\nSummoned by Pansy and Blaise, a sullen boy with closely cropped hair, Draco takes a seat opposite them. He catches sight of his briefcase subtly moving on the luggage rack. Meanwhile, on the Hogwarts platform, Hagrid stands, swinging a lantern as the train arrives, its headlight piercing the gloom. Pansy and Blaise, waiting for Draco, finally exit their compartment, as do Ron and Hermione.\n\nDraco retrieves his briefcase from the luggage rack and moves toward the door to the next carriage, sliding it shut and pulling down the blind, causing all the blinds to close. An object falls from the rack and crashes to the floor. Draco removes the invisibility cloak, revealing Harry, frozen and staring. Draco stamps on the immobilized Harry, then covers him again with the cloak and exits the carriage. He steps onto the nearly empty platform, glancing around as he walks away, steam rising behind him.\n\nSomeone walks through the train, viewing it as if through a rose-tinted kaleidoscope, with pink and mauve shapes swirling. The carriage door opens, revealing Luna, donned in blue and white Spectrespecs as advertised in the Quibbler. She observes a cloud of silvery dust hovering above the floor, prompting her to draw her wand. She removes the invisibility cloak, and Harry breaks free from the immobility spell. Luna lifts her specs. Harry's nose is broken and bleeding.\n\nThey arrive at the school gates, where Flitwick installs an invisible shield. Luna and Harry watch as Draco forcefully takes his walking stick from Filch. Draco notices Harry and smirks before walking away, followed by Snape who turns on his heel. Luna raises her wand, and Harry's swollen, misshapen nose returns to normal, though blood remains on his upper lip, chin, and t-shirt.\n\nIn the Great Hall, Ron eagerly consumes jelly and cream, only to be struck by Hermione with a book. Harry approaches them. Dumbledore ascends to the lectern, adorned with a gilded owl that stretches its wings. Ginny gently wipes the blood from Harry's face. Professor Slughorn, dressed in a gown and mortarboard, acknowledges the applause. Amidst the celebrating Slytherins, Draco stares blankly ahead, lost in thought, his chin resting on his hand. The other students exchange glances as Draco remains seated.",
    "602": "In the corridor of Hogwarts, Professor McGonagall is seen standing solemnly. Nearby, Harry Potter and Ron Weasley share a moment of laughter against a wall before Harry parts from Ron to approach McGonagall, who responds with a shake of her head.\n\nThe scene shifts to a potions class where the atmosphere is tense with activity. A student eagerly raises a hand as another steps toward the potions area. Harry, curious, opens a cupboard door and carefully places a lid on a container, prompting nearby girls to step back in caution. Draco Malfoy watches with keen interest as students struggle with their assignments; Ron attempts to slice a Sopophorous bean, which first rolls away and then shoots into the air upon his second try. Seamus Finnigan makes a bold stab at his bean, while Professor Slughorn impressively catches one midair. Even the usually proficient Hermione Granger faces difficulties. Harry, taking guidance from handwritten notes in his book, successfully drips juice into his cauldron, contrasting with the struggles of others like Crabbe and Goyle, who see no success. Seamus's cauldron suddenly flares up, blackening his face, while Harry continues to follow the notes, achieving success by adding a clear liquid. A girl's cauldron spills green slime onto the table, and Hermione grows increasingly frustrated. Professor Slughorn, impressed by Harry's work, drops a leaf into Harry's brewing pot and leads the class in applause, though Draco and his Slytherin companions remain unimpressed and do not join in.\n\nLater, in his study, Professor Dumbledore examines a book with a burnt hole, into which he places a ring before closing the book and stowing it away in a drawer. Dumbledore then turns his attention to a cabinet filled with vials, from which he selects one. Harry, handling it delicately, takes the vial to a Pensieve—a shallow, hovering metal basin—and with a nod from Dumbledore, pours its contents into the basin. Dumbledore dims the lights with a flick of his hand as Harry immerses his face into the basin, surrounded by wispy trails of black smoke.\n\nWithin the Pensieve, Harry witnesses a scene on a street leading to a large building. A figure with an umbrella marches toward it, and a younger Dumbledore enters a room where an 11-year-old boy, Tom, sits at a table and stares at him with a frown. Dumbledore touches a wardrobe, in front of which shells and pebbles line a window's edge alongside a postcard of a craggy coastline. Suddenly, the wardrobe by the door bursts into flames, and Tom retrieves a metal box from it, extracting small toys. As Dumbledore moves away from the sullen Tom, he pauses, and swirling black smoke envelops the image of the boy. Harry withdraws his face from the Pensieve, taking deep breaths and staring resolutely ahead.\n\nThe tranquility is shattered as Death Eaters charge through the clouds toward Hogwarts, only to be repelled by an invisible shield. In a shadowy corridor within the castle, two birds in a cage hang as Draco Malfoy walks past them toward a wall adorned with a tapestry of a unicorn.",
    "603": "In a cluttered room, Draco Malfoy pauses, his gaze sweeping the space as he idly tosses an apple. The creak of wood draws his attention, and he turns to see the source. With a determined tug, he pulls down a heavy cloth, unveiling a tall, triangular cabinet reminiscent of one from Borgin and Burkes. Draco inspects this cabinet meticulously.\n\nMeanwhile, at the Quidditch stadium, a lone student soars overhead. Harry Potter and Ginny Weasley stand together, overseeing the Gryffindor trials. The aspiring players turn their attention to Harry and Ginny. Among the hopefuls, Ron Weasley stands rigidly, adorned in a protective leather helmet. From the stands, Hermione Granger offers a wave of encouragement. Cormac McLaggen saunters over to Ron, casually slapping his arm before strutting away, leaving Ron visibly downcast. Cormac takes to the air, confidently flying towards a circular goalpost, while Ron nearly slips from his broom as he maneuvers towards the opposing goal. Lavender Brown watches Ron intently. Cormac catches Hermione's eye, smirking, while she looks away briefly before stealing another glance.\n\nThe trials commence amidst the excitement. Two players collide in mid-air and plummet. Ginny, wielding a round leather Quaffle, aims it at Cormac's goal. With agile moves, Cormac punches the Quaffle away with his right hand, kicks another aside, and punches a third with his left. He then secures the next Quaffle. It's Ron's turn to defend his goal; he flails wildly, punching and kicking to deflect shots, but a Quaffle ultimately unseats him, leaving him dangling precariously from his broomstick. Lavender jumps to her feet, cheering for Ron, who manages to regain his seat on the broomstick. Hermione watches as Ron clings on anxiously. Two Chasers zip past Harry, and Cormac smirks confidently. Hermione mutters a spell into her hand, smiling as Cormac is suddenly jerked sideways, allowing the Quaffle to sail past him and through the goal. Another Quaffle is aimed at Ron, who swings helplessly; it strikes his head and bounces away.\n\nLater, in the Gryffindor common room, Hermione makes a face. Ron looks over at Lavender, who waves at him, but then glares back. Harry closes a book and stands up, only for Ginny to snatch it from him. Hermione and Ginny fix their gazes on Harry, who shifts uncomfortably. Ginny tosses the book back to him, and he exits the room, watched by both girls. In his room, Harry sits at a table, the book open before him, its pages covered in scribbled notes.\n\nWalking through the snow, the trio encounters Professor Flitwick. They enter The Three Broomsticks, where Harry spots Draco Malfoy leaving. Ron notices Ginny with Dean Thomas, while Hermione observes them as well. Ginny and Dean share a kiss at their corner table. Ron turns to Harry, his jaw clenched and a scowl on his face. Leaning on the table, Ron raises his eyebrows and glances at Hermione, then points to his upper lip. Hermione, realizing she has butterbeer froth on her lip, wipes it off with her sleeve and gazes at Ron.\n\nOn their way back, Leanne and Katie Bell walk ahead of the trio.",
    "605": "In a gripping Quidditch match, Gryffindor players skillfully maneuvered the Quaffle, dodging opponents until one player launched it towards the goal. Swiftly, Ron Weasley, Gryffindor's goalkeeper, dove to block the shot, thrilling his supporters who erupted in joy. Amidst the aerial battle, Ron tirelessly thwarted numerous Slytherin assaults. From the stands, Hermione Granger, though skeptical, couldn't help but watch the game unfold.\n\nGryffindor then shifted to an offensive strategy. A Slytherin Beater attempted to knock a Bludger towards a Gryffindor player but missed, resulting in the Beater being thrown off his broom. As Gryffindor scored, their fans cheered loudly, prompting a fierce counterattack from Slytherin in a V formation. The Quaffle raced towards the goal, only for Ron to make another spectacular save. Triumphantly, he raised his right fist and basked in the adulation of the chanting crowd. Hermione offered a faint smile.\n\nBalanced perfectly on his broom, Ron celebrated by raising both arms in victory. Later, in the Gryffindor common room, he stood on a table as red confetti rained down on him. Harry Potter showed Hermione an unopened vial of Liquid Luck, shaking his head at her questioning look. The celebration was briefly interrupted when Lavender Brown threw her arms around Ron, kissing him passionately. Harry couldn't help but grin, while Hermione, standing beside him, took a deep breath. As the kiss lingered, Hermione turned sharply and left the room. Harry noticed her departure and followed.\n\nIn a dimly lit corridor, Harry heard sobbing. Descending a spiral staircase, he spotted Hermione sitting on the bottom step, weeping. His shadow loomed large on the wall as he approached her. Charm birds fluttered around Hermione as she looked up at Harry, who sat down beside her, offering silent support.\n\nMeanwhile, Ron and Lavender dashed into a cloister. Lavender tried to pull Ron away, but Hermione, her expression hardened, stood up. Suddenly, the birds attacked Ron, who fled in panic. The birds crashed into a wooden door, leaving a mess of feathers. Ron, alarmed, glanced back at Hermione before walking away. Hermione slumped back onto the step, eventually leaning her head on Harry's shoulder. Harry, feeling awkward, gently placed his hand on her arm.\n\nThe party continued, but Ron and Lavender, absent from the festivities, ran up a staircase, pausing by a tall window to kiss passionately. Elsewhere, Draco Malfoy stood alone on the astronomy tower, leaning on the balustrade and gazing over Hogwarts as snow gently covered the school's spires and roofs. The cloisters were adorned with festive greenery.\n\nAmidst the holiday decorations, a raven-haired girl smiled, and Luna Lovegood, dressed elegantly in a knee-length tiered dress of pale pink silk with chiffon ruffles around the neckline, skirt, and sleeves, was escorted by Harry. They walked past a window bay where Draco sat, lost in thought. His expression stern, Draco later walked through an upstairs corridor, stopping momentarily. Closing his eyes, he entered a cluttered room, removed a heavy cloth from a cabinet, opened it, placed an apple inside, and then reopened it to find the apple vanished.",
    "607": "A young blond boy, cross-legged, watches a black and white show on a large wooden TV set. At an awards ceremony, guests applaud a movie clip on screen. Nearby, a man sits quietly. Sophie, slender and stunningly beautiful, is announced by a woman on stage. Gobsmacked, Sophie sits beside someone as Sidney, beaming, claps enthusiastically. Shapely, raven-haired Sophie then rises from her seat. Sidney turns to face the camera. From a nearby table, a smartly dressed man and woman stand up. Camera phone images capture Ricky Gervais. Sidney stands by a red rope barrier, leading a pig. He grins as a nervous woman lifts the barrier for him, and Alison leads Sidney and the pig away to the Haymarket Hotel. Disguised as a waiter with a fake mustache, Sidney enters the party, obscuring his face with a tray of canapes, sneaking past a strict woman with a clipboard. His pig, Britney, wags her curly tail and eagerly snaps up a canape tossed by Sidney. By the pool, Sidney chats with Thandie Newton, sipping champagne. Thandie smiles coyly, then bursts into laughter and pats Sidney on the thigh. She gives him a sultry look, and he responds with a grin and a bashful sigh that disturbs his fake mustache, prompting a frown from Thandie.\n\nMeanwhile, the brown-haired hotel manager knocks on Sidney's room door and enters to find the room trashed: chocolates and booze bottles litter the floor near an open fridge, with upturned furniture scattered around. Unseen, Britney trots out of the hotel room, scurries down a corridor to a lift, and the electric doors close. Thandie continues to flirt with Sidney, smiling flirtatiously. Britney, wandering out of the lift, urinates on a lady's red high heels. The PR Nazi pushes through the crowd, and Sidney spots Britney. Thandie stands as bouncers approach, and Sidney scampers away. The PR Nazi watches hawkishly as Thandie shrugs and two bouncers give chase. A woman is pushed aside during the commotion. Sidney takes a running jump, and a photographer captures the moment mid-flight. A photo in a newspaper shows Clint Eastwood with Sidney in a headlock at a postmodern review event.\n\nBack at his busy living room turned office, Sidney, holding a lit cigarette, hears the phone ringing and staff arguing next door. A cover of the postmodern review criticizes Sharp's editor while writers gather in a frenzy to watch a brewing fight. Women cause a ruckus, flipping over a fax machine. An airplane soars through the blue sky. At night, Sidney, in a taxi, gazes wide-eyed at a theater's entrance sign. He cruises through Chinatown, but his smile fades upon seeing a helicopter.",
    "616": "In Sydney's red brick building, sunlight bathes the exterior as inside, he prepares a hearty breakfast in the kitchen. Alison enters, draped in his oversized pajamas, and massages her neck while her gaze lingers on a black and white photo that Richard had been examining earlier. Sydney returns his attention to the stove, continuing his cooking, as Alison takes her place at the table, eyeing the spread of bacon, sausage, eggs, tomatoes, beans, and toast. Suddenly, she dashes away, covering her mouth.\n\nIn the living room, Sydney fluffs a cushion on his leather sofa and retrieves his father's book from the coffee table, inadvertently knocking Alison's handbag to the floor. Its contents spill out, prompting him to hastily gather them. Among the items, he notices Alison's red notebook, adorned with a gold butterfly emblem. With a furtive glance, he opens it and begins to read, only to look up and find Alison observing him. She shrugs nonchalantly and sits down, starting to collect her belongings from the table.\n\nThe melody from the soundtrack of La Dolce Vita fills the room as Alison, holding the record, looks up with a smile. Sydney takes the worn sleeve from her, and as he places the record on the player, she closes her eyes and smiles. With a wry smile, Sydney begins to dance and extends his hand to Alison, leading them into a dance. As they move, Sydney's attractive mother seems to watch from a photograph on the shelving unit. Alison, with a mischievous grin, joins Sydney in a playful jive. He lifts her hand high above his head in the dance.\n\nThe building, nestled amidst lush greenery and surrounded by crumbling apartment blocks, appears small in comparison to the looming skyscrapers on the horizon. At her workplace, Alison sits at her desk while Ingrid presents various dresses to another model. Sydney, eavesdropping at the door, quickly escapes through a fire exit upon hearing Alison's approach, inadvertently triggering the alarm. He closes the door behind him and turns to see a crowd of office workers gathering, which then disperses, leaving Alison to watch him as he walks away. He taps a sign on the door before pulling a wildlife book from a shelf.\n\nIn his bathroom, Sydney faces the mirror and applies white face paint, inserting fake fangs and donning a cape. He wrinkles his nose at his reflection before heading out with a glass of wine, encountering Elena, who is costumed as Marlene Dietrich and engaged in conversation. Sydney moves on, observing a person dressed as Elvis Presley kissing someone in a nun's habit. He approaches Alison, now wearing a black wig and smoking a long cigarette. Sydney removes his fangs as Lawrence hands Alison a glass of champagne, kisses her cheek, and then walks away, leaving Sydney to shift uncomfortably and shake his head. They both sip their drinks, staring ahead, until Sydney looks at Alison and sighs.",
    "621": "As she ascends the steps to the Lorings' front door, she meticulously smooths the hem of her skirt that covers her jeans. She then peeks through one of the two oval leaded windows. Inside, she presents an image to Mark, who momentarily seems to drift away into the music before his eyes lock with Juno's. Juno notices a VHS nearby. Mark swiftly grabs the tape from her, and together they watch the chilling scene of a sinister man driving a stake through a woman's stomach.\n\nLater, Juno displays the picture to Vanessa, who meticulously examines it both lengthwise and sideways. Vanessa casts a glance at Mark, receiving a harsh shrug in response. Standing rigidly with her arms tightly folded, Vanessa receives a tight-lipped smile from her husband as he places Juno's bag on her shoulder and opens the door for her departure. By the time Juno reaches home, the night has fallen, and she sips from a drinks carton. Inside, Bren is focused on cutting out pictures of dogs. As Bren returns to her paper dogs, Juno pours the remaining drink into Bren's ornament.\n\nOutside on the snowy street, Juno halts the Previa and slips off her grey overskirt. Bleeker's mother opens her front door, but Juno races up the stairs, outpacing Bleeker's mother to reach Bleeker's room first. Bleeker reaches for a box, and Juno eases into a chair, legs spread apart. She then slides onto the floor next to him, both looking away in awkward silence. Suddenly, Juno's mood shifts to gloom.\n\nBack at her home, Vanessa, dressed in an old T-shirt and her hair pulled back into a ponytail, stands before a bare wall. Mark, next to her with folded arms, also looks glum. Vanessa, nervously playing with the chain around her neck, turns to face the wall behind her, while Mark stares at it bleakly.\n\nJuno and Leah are at the mall, crouching behind a glass balcony. In the mall play area, Vanessa is playfully engaging with a friend's little girl. Leah sucks in her cheeks, then stands and looks away, but Juno remains, watching Vanessa interact with the child. A soft smile graces Juno's face. They then approach Vanessa, who shakes her head in awe. Juno winces slightly before placing Vanessa's hand on her belly. Vanessa, her beautiful sculpted face tightening self-consciously, shakes her head again. Dropping to her knees in front of Juno, Vanessa nervously glances around before placing her hands on Juno's belly, her eyes widening with excitement. Juno, standing above her, watches Vanessa with a mixture of fondness and pride, as Vanessa gazes at the swollen belly with adoration.\n\nFinally, at home, Bren works at her sewing machine, cutting the top of a pair of jeans and attaching an elasticated band, a satisfied smile crossing her face as she tests the elasticity.",
    "622": "Juno, adorned in her adapted jeans, descends the school steps. Her hands are buried deep within the pockets of her oversized tartan parker. As she advances, her fellow students, fixated on her protruding belly, instinctively part to create a pathway for her.\n\nMeanwhile, at home, Mark is engrossed in composing music. In the school canteen, amidst the quiet of an empty school awards booth, two girls consume their lunch. Leah, one of them, gazes with adoration at the chubby, bearded teacher nearby.\n\nAt his locker, Bleeker recoils slightly. Juno, visibly pregnant, waddles over to him, locking eyes with him intensely. Bleeker's gaze flickers nervously, glancing towards Katrina before his head droops in desolation. Juno, with her canvas bag slung over her shoulder, strides away decisively, leaving Bleeker to watch her departure with a sullen expression.\n\nHoisting herself into her dad's Previa, Juno applies some lip balm and starts the engine. At that moment, Mark, distracted by his computer screen, notices the blue van arriving outside his house. Juno follows Mark down to a cluttered basement room where she reads a title. Her hands then reach for his waist, and he guides them up to his neck. Embracing, with his hands around her waist and her belly pressed against him, they sway slowly together. Juno closes her eyes, resting her head on his chest, while Mark, his chin grazing her hair, appears unsettled. Startled, Juno looks up, staring at him in bewilderment.\n\nIn the midst of this, Vanessa, burdened with shopping, enters her immaculate white kitchen. Mark averts his eyes. Sensing the need to leave, Juno begins to depart, eventually bolting out the door. Clutching her belly, she waddles back to the Previa. Mark, in his rock T-shirt layered over a long-sleeved undershirt, gives Vanessa a cold look before retreating to his room. Vanessa, overwhelmed, sinks onto the stairs, her gaze lost in unhappy thoughts.\n\nUnder a cloudy sky, Juno drives beneath a road bridge, passing a freight train. She veers off onto the soft shoulder next to a field of dull green grass, speckled with patches of spring snow. Overcome by emotion, she strokes her belly and succumbs to tears. Crammed behind the wheel, seemingly oblivious to the traffic around her, she continues to rub her belly beneath her thick tartan coat, her eyes fixed ahead on nothing in particular. Gradually, she starts to calm down. The car lights flash as she merges back onto the road and drives away.\n\nUp in his room after dark, Bleeker strums his guitar. Later, atop the van's bonnet with her head resting against the sloping front windshield, Juno lies with her hands tucked behind her back, staring at the sky. Suddenly, she props herself up on her elbows and climbs back into the van. Rummaging behind her seat, she retrieves a crumpled receipt, which she smooths out on the steering wheel and begins to write on.",
    "623": "In her pristine home, Vanessa sits alone at the dining table, savoring a glass of red wine. Mark descends the stairs and approaches her, pulling up a chair with a hint of smugness playing across his lips. As he opens the front door, he glimpses Juno driving away, and at his feet, he discovers the note she left behind. Vanessa swiftly takes it from him, and together they read its contents.\n\nJuno parks her Previa on the street in front of a wooden slatted house, where the porch light casts a glow on a straw heart hanging from the door knocker. She emerges from the vehicle, visibly drained both emotionally and physically. In the front garden, she pauses to pluck a crocus, and with a solemn demeanor, she traces a circle on her belly with its petal. Inside, her father, his mustache prominent and bald head shining under the kitchen light, is preoccupied with fixing something at the table as Juno enters. She collapses into a chair beside him. He gazes at her stomach, and Juno nods with a wry smile that soon brightens. Her dad, Mac, returns a smile and continues his tinkering.\n\nThrough the slats of Bleeker's upstairs window blinds, Juno and Leah can be seen cleaning the Previa. The next morning, as the track team runs past his house, Bleeker steps outside. He opens the mailbox, and orange Tic Tac packs tumble out at his feet, prompting a delighted grin. The running team continues their sprint around the track. Spotting Juno approaching past a group of cheerleaders practicing their routine, Bleeker breaks away and jogs to meet her. Smiling, she takes his hand and guides it to her belly, clasping it with her own. Their eyes meet, and he smiles. Dressed in a brown sweatshirt and skimpy yellow shorts, he kisses her, and standing on tiptoes, Juno tenderly cups his face. A sullen secret admirer watches, while Leah, doing stretches, grins. Juno playfully gives Leah the finger, her lips remaining locked with Bleeker's.\n\nLater, Juno amusingly drives a matchbox police car over the peak of her large belly. It slips from her grasp, and she rolls her eyes. Suddenly, Mac, Juno, and Bren burst out of the front door, with Liberty Belly in her ballet attire.\n\nAt the hospital, Leah humorously steers Juno's wheelchair into a gown trolley. In the birthing suite, Bren, Leah, and the midwife keep their focus intensely on Juno as a squawking baby, still attached by its umbilical cord, is born. Juno gazes at the newborn for a long moment before closing her eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, Bleeker breaks the finish line tape and looks around for Juno. Not finding her, he runs up the steps of the stand and away. Back in the hospital room, Mac gently strokes Juno's hair as she lies on her side in bed, recovering.",
    "625": "Ray continues to stare ahead, his gaze fixed and unwavering. Gradually, he lowers his eyes and a frown creases his brow. Nearby, Graham watches him closely, scrutinizing every movement. Ray bows his head, consumed by reflection, his eyes heavy with guilt and unwilling to meet Graham's gaze. Slowly, he turns away, taking a deep breath, his eyes filled with sorrow as they linger on Graham. With a heavy heart, he starts the engine and settles back into his seat. Graham's stare intensifies, his eyes moistening slightly as he grapples with his emotions, his lips curling and features crumpling into a mask of suffering. He nods painfully as Ray drops his gaze, unable to hold it any longer.\n\nTurning away, Graham now faces Ray's clapboard home. Inside the farmhouse, in the closet under the stairs, Merrill watches the TV, his brow furrowed with worry and lips slightly parted. He pulls his chair closer to the screen, captivated by the camcorder footage showing his young children inside the house in a state of hysteria. The children gather by the French windows, pointing excitedly to the backyard where tables full of party food sit abandoned. The camera pans to the tall bench bushes at the back of the yard before returning to the house interior, following the children as they rush to another window. Merrill watches, frustration etched across his face.\n\nThrough the camera's lens, a boy peers out into a narrow passageway. Suddenly, the camera focuses on the passage as a lanky, dark figure with a human appearance strides across it and vanishes from view. Shocked, Merrill recoils, cupping a hand to his face as he stumbles back from the TV. The film rewinds, and he sits back down, gaping at the screen as the image freezes on the mysterious creature, flickering slightly.\n\nMeanwhile, Graham enters Ray's house, pausing hesitantly outside the open kitchen door. He steps timidly into the room, noting the chairs overturned on the floor and the tables barricading the door to the pantry. A shadow moves under the door as Graham cautiously approaches, the movement soon accompanied by a faint sound. He stares intently at the gap beneath the door, watching as the shadow stops moving. Anxiety grips him as he eyes the door, swallowing hard. Nodding to himself, he closes his eyes and whispers \"Patty Wagon\" to himself, a small charm. The shadow under the door remains motionless.\n\nIncredulous, Graham glances away from the door briefly. Then, with his head turned wearily to one side and slightly ticked back defensively, he delicately drops to a kneeling position. Bending down, he presses his face to the tiles and peers under the pantry door, only to find shards of glass. Relieved, he kneels up and sighs. Spotting chopped vegetables on a worktop next to a large kitchen knife, he contemplates it for a moment before reaching out and grabbing it.",
    "631": "In the basement, Graham watches as Merrill, kneeling beside him, switches on a device before carefully removing a pickaxe from under a doorknob and opening the door. Merrill then cautiously ascends the shadowy stairwell to the kitchen, where sunlight streams through irregular holes in the boarded-up window. Upon reaching the top, he glances around before turning left and momentarily disappearing from Graham's sight. He soon reappears, looking down the stairwell and giving a nod.\n\nGraham, carrying Morgan, ascends the stairs into the kitchen, navigating around chairs scattered on the floor and past an open fridge door. Bo follows her father but then drifts into the hallway. As Graham moves through the dining room into the living room, he notices the broken planks over the windows. Inside, a table lamp lies toppled under one window, and a picture beneath a mounted baseball bat hangs crookedly, though the room otherwise remains undisturbed. Graham tenderly places Morgan on the sofa. Bo reenters the room, performing a small dance with swinging arms and thrusting hips. Graham's gaze shifts to Morgan.\n\nHe then proceeds to the cupboard under the stairs, unplugs a television set, and wheels the TV trolley through the hallway into the living room. After positioning the trolley, he bends down to plug it in. As he does so, horror floods him upon seeing a reflection in the screen: a tall humanoid figure, silhouetted against the window, holding Morgan in one of its arms.\n\nRising slowly, Graham turns to face the creature. Merrill enters from the dining room, freezes, and drops a syringe. Stepping forward, he confronts the alien alongside Graham. The alien, with its highly domed, smooth-skinned, earless head and odd-shaped mouth exposing dull gray teeth, stares intently between the two men. Graham's eyes fix on the alien's lower arm wrapped around Morgan, the fabric matching Morgan's shirt. He notes two of the creature's four clawed digits are missing.\n\nGraham's mind flashes back to using a knife outside Ray's pantry. The alien extends its other hand over Morgan's face, tilting its wrist upward, and a sharp spike emerges from its wrist, positioning it threateningly above Morgan's nose. Merrill, Graham, and Bo stand immobilized, consumed by horror as the alien alternates its gaze between Morgan and Graham.\n\nGraham scrutinizes the creature's hooded eyes, recalling driving to the scene of the accident where he saw Caroline waving her arms in the road. Another memory surfaces of him crouching by the front of Ray's pickup, where his wife's head lay on the bonnet, her presence haunting his thoughts as he faces the alien.",
    "637": "Graham's station wagon pulls up outside Merrill's converted barn upon returning to the farm. Inside, Merrill and Graham release their seat belts and turn towards a buzzing sound emanating from the back. Morgan, seated next to Bo in her child's car seat, lifts a pale blue radio receiver from beside him and listens intently, his ear pressed against it. He then points upward to the sky, prompting Merrill to sigh and look away. Observing his brother, Graham ponders briefly before turning back to Morgan, reaching out to receive the radio from him. Both Graham and Merrill fix their gaze on one another, their ears tuned to the receiver's output, while Merrill expresses exasperation by sitting back.\n\nThe family exits the vehicle, with Bo freezing in shock upon stepping out. Merrill, looking down at Morgan, considers the situation as Graham leans back into the car. Standing slowly, Graham notices Merrill's unease. Extending his hand, Merrill joins Graham in holding the receiver across the car's roof. Morgan, climbing onto the roof, crawls towards them and reclaims the device. Meanwhile, Bo dashes around to the front of the car, attempting to clamber up onto the roof, but Graham, seating himself on the bonnet, blocks her path. Merrill joins Morgan on the roof, steadying him as he directs the receiver towards the sky. As Bo tries again to ascend, Merrill reaches out to assist her. Morgan, lowering the receiver, inspects it closely before Bo slides back into Graham's lap.\n\nLater, with a metal dish of dog food for Isabel in hand, Graham steps out of the farmhouse through a screen door and into the night. He strides purposefully across the lawn towards the Alsatian, chained to its kennel. Agitated, Isabel jumps and pulls at her chain, barking towards the trembling maize field. Halting just before reaching her, Graham surveys the darkened field, then slowly pivots to face the crop directly. Isabel lunges at him, causing Graham to recoil in surprise, his attention snapping back to the rustling field, which continues to unsettle the dog.\n\nSeeking further, Graham opens a weathered metal toolbox on a picnic bench and retrieves a large torch. He cautiously advances, extending his free hand for balance, and directs the beam towards the crop's edge. Graham proceeds slowly into the tall, dense corn, navigating a narrow passage between the rigid stalks. The torchlight, cast at a low angle, highlights the limp, straggly green leaves that bend back as he presses forward through the maize.",
    "638": "Graham comes to a sudden stop, lifting his torch to peer down the foliage-lined tunnel ahead. He quickly pivots, directing the beam into the dense jungle beside him, but sees nothing; the light barely penetrates the thick, green stalks. Lowering the flashlight to his side, he cautiously advances through the crop, using one arm to shield his face from the leaves. Upon reaching the first of the crop circles, he gently drops his arm and gradually halts, his gaze filled with a fresh wave of concern.\n\nA pale, gray light bathes the perfectly circular area where the corn lies uniformly flattened. The leaves shimmer with a silvery glow. Standing motionless, Graham's torch sends a thin beam of light skimming across the circle. His eyes flit anxiously around the space. Swallowing hard, he steadies his breath and continues to scan the circle with apprehension. He then takes a cautious step backward toward the standing corn, turns abruptly, and forcefully pushes into the stalks.\n\nStruggling against the rigid forest of maize, Graham eventually stumbles onto a path that slices between two cornfields. He sweeps his torch along the clear pathway, then turns and illuminates the other direction, finding nothing once again. His gaze remains fixed on the crop until, suddenly, he whirls around, dropping the torch and plunging into darkness. Panting, he keeps his eyes locked on the maize. Warily crouching, he fumbles for the flashlight, frantically smacks the lens until the beam flickers back to life, briefly lighting his tense face. He directs the light down the path just as a long, thin, bare leg silently slips into the corn. Scrambling backward, Graham then leaps up and sprints in the opposite direction, crashing through the corn as his torchlight dances over the leaves.\n\nBack at the farmhouse, Morgan and Bo are at the sink in the kitchen, which seamlessly flows into the lounge area. Merrill, sitting at a table with his back to them, idly chews gum while flipping through an army pamphlet he had picked up in town. Unseen by the others, Graham quietly enters the kitchen and pauses before gently settling into a chair at the table. His children turn to see him staring vacantly at the floor. Morgan tentatively approaches the table, while Bo stays at the sink. Merrill casually glances over his shoulder, notices his brother's despondent demeanor, rises, and moves into the kitchen, stopping just before reaching the table. Graham meets Merrill's gaze, then sits up straighter and lets out a sigh.\n\nOn the television screen, mysterious lights hang in the night sky as Graham and Merrill sit on the sofa, while Morgan and Bo kneel close to the TV, absorbed by the sight.",
    "640": "Graham points toward an object, causing Graham to hesitate and falter. As Graham opens a book, his uncertainty becomes apparent. He dubiously accepts the book from Morgan and begins flipping through its pages, while Morgan and Bo watch. Within the book, one page displays a sketch of an extraterrestrial characterized by a teardrop-shaped head and large, catlike eyes. Another page features an image of a blue-green alien with an angular jaw and black, almond-shaped eyes. A third page shows a nighttime scene where a UFO emits two red laser beams, igniting a wooden farmhouse. Flames are seen erupting from the upstairs windows of the burning house. On the lawn of this depicted house lie three shadowy figures: an adult and two children. Morgan and Bo fix their gaze on this image. Graham's eyes move pensively side to side, and suddenly, all three jump back in surprise. Taking the book with him, Graham leaves the room to answer a phone call on the landing, standing motionless with the receiver pressed to his ear. His eyes dart down the landing into a room with a dressmaker's dummy.\n\nNow dressed, Graham descends the stairs, retrieves a coat from the closet where Merrill remains fixated on the television, and picks up a set of keys. Merrill appears confused by Graham's actions. Meanwhile, from the bedroom, Morgan uses a telescope to observe clouds, with Bo standing beside him. Bo, wearing a worried expression, nods slowly and deliberately, hugs Morgan's arm, and avoids eye contact.\n\nGraham proceeds to knock on the door of Vet. Ray Reddy's house. He opens the screen door, peeks through the slats of the wooden door behind it, and then gently closes the screen. Graham releases the handle, steps back, and scans his surroundings from left to right. He walks calmly along the wooden veranda surrounding the house, halting at a closed window to peer into an office. Inside, the office is deserted, with a dark wood desk littered with papers. Graham notices a wooden chair overturned beside a lampshade, and above it, a small round table with a toppled vase and a brightly glowing naked bulb. Graham observes this scene with restrained alarm and begins to back away.\n\nTurning, he spots a brown Chevy 4x4 parked on a short driveway, with a figure at the wheel. Graham cautiously approaches the vehicle across the lawn, leaning in to see its occupant. The passenger side window is lowered, and Graham, with an inquisitive frown, places both hands on the sill and leans into the vehicle. Inside, Ray, an Asian man who has stayed in town, sits gripping the steering wheel, rocking nervously and staring blankly ahead. Graham's eyes questioningly survey bundles of clothes in the back of the vehicle. Returning his focus to the front, he notices a blood stain on Ray's check shirt.",
    "644": "Jamal hastily drinks his beverage as the inspector prepares to exit the room. Outside Javed's opulent residence, Jamal notices through the windows that much of the furniture has been removed. In a fit of frustration, he forcefully bangs his head against the door. The inspector then departs, leaving Jamal staring at the ground, visibly exhausted.\n\nA news segment begins airing on television, catching the attention of Salim and Latika, who exchange a quick glance before refocusing on the screen. A prominent scar on Latika's cheekbone becomes noticeable. In the room with them are several girls, thugs, and Javed. As Jamal appears on the TV, Javed quickly grabs the remote and switches the channel, then signals for the girls to start dancing. Amid the ensuing commotion, Latika quietly slips out of the room, her departure noticed by Salim. The room fills with scantily clad girls mingling with the thugs. A girl attempts to dance with Javed while he is on the phone, but he dismissively waves her away and moves to a quieter space. Salim, showing disinterest in the dancing girls, leaves to join Latika next door. There, he finds her wiping tears from her face. Approaching her, Salim extends a set of keys, which Latika accepts. He shakes his head, pulls out his phone, dials a number, then closes it and hands it to her. With a gentle touch, he strokes her cheek near the scar, holds the door open for her exit, and then closes it behind her as she rushes to his car.\n\nSalim returns to the main room where Javed is still engaged in a phone conversation. Meanwhile, Latika starts the car and drives at high speed through crowded roads until she is forced to slow down due to heavy traffic, finding herself stuck in gridlock.\n\nBack at the studio, Srinivas throws water on a dozing Jamal to wake him. Crowds cheer as Jamal arrives in a police van, cameras flashing as an old woman spots him inside the vehicle. The gathering crowd starts to cheer enthusiastically, while across the country, people congregate in front of TVs to watch the unfolding events. Latika remains in her car amidst the traffic jam. Outside electronic shops, crowds gather to watch the show on display TVs, and an entire family enjoys their supper while viewing the program. At the Excel Five Call Center, the main room is nearly empty, but the TV room is packed with staff. A manager enters and sees Jamal's image on the screen.\n\nIn the studio, the host guides Jamal to his seat. Outside, Latika abandons her car and opts to walk, eventually stopping at an electronic shop to join others watching Jamal on the screen. As Jamal smiles, he reminisces about his teacher beating him with a book and sheltering from the rain during his childhood, fondly recalling how she had suggested he could be the third musketeer.",
    "641": "In an interrogation room, a corpulent policeman aggressively blows cigarette smoke into the face of a terrified, sweating young man, Jamal Malik, who blinks rapidly as the smoke irritates his eyes. Suddenly, the policeman lunges across the table towards Jamal.\n\nA question flashes on the screen as hands scatter Rupee notes onto the floor. The show's host, turning towards Jamal standing in the studio's wings, leads him to their chairs centrally positioned on the stage. The scene shifts back to the police cell, where the policeman forcefully submerges Jamal's head into a bucket of water.\n\nThe scene changes to a train platform where a beautiful young woman stands, her face lighting up with a smile as she looks up. Back in a dimly lit room, the inspector enters to find Jamal suspended by his wrists off the floor. Srinivas, reluctantly, prepares a car battery and attaches jump leads to Jamal's big toes. Jamal glares defiantly into the inspector's eyes. As Srinivas activates the battery, the inspector moves to the other side of the room. Returning to Jamal's now limp body, the inspector observes his closed eyes and dribbling mouth, closely examining his face. Both policemen slowly turn towards Jamal as he spits blood.\n\nThe setting shifts to a runway where a group of scruffy young boys, clad in filthy t-shirts and shorts, engage in a game of cricket. Among them, a young Jamal trips and misses the ball, prompting the other boys to slap their heads in disappointment. Suddenly, security men on motorbikes appear, brandishing long truncheons. The boys scatter in panic; one boy even makes a rude gesture at the guards, eliciting a high-five from his peers.\n\nThe boys flee across a rubbish tip, navigating over corrugated rooftops and into the narrow alleyways of their slum. The security men dismount and chase on foot, struggling to keep up as the agile boys weave through the filthy, narrow streets between shanty buildings. Some boys throw rubbish from the rooftops onto the guards below. A determined guard persists in pursuing Salim and Jamal down a walkway past a river clogged with rubbish, plastic bags, and green slime. The boys dash along a sewage pipe, the guard close behind. Their escape abruptly ends as they collide with a Mercedes. Inside, Javed, the local gangster, shouts angrily at them. As the boys flee, the guard crashes into the car, backing away apologetically while holding his cap. The boys taunt the guard and, turning a corner, unexpectedly run into their mother, who promptly drags them to school.",
    "648": "A man cautiously carries a spoon to a table. He then pries open Arvind's eyelids and pours a liquid into them. Overwhelmed, Salim kneels and vomits, unable to bear the sight. Meanwhile, Maman observes the scene with a cold detachment. A bearded man, an associate of Maman, wraps a bandage around Arvind's eyes and gently pats his head. Maman shifts his gaze to Salim and gives a subtle nod. The bearded man readies another dose of the liquid. Shock washes over Salim's face, leaving him frozen in place. Maman approaches Salim, crouching before him, then signals to Punnoose to trail Salim.\n\nAmidst this tension, Jamal breaks into a dance. Salim appears and they shake hands; Jamal follows him back to where Maman and the bearded man wait, with Punnoose closely behind. As they move, Latika secretly watches. Maman and his henchmen are taken aback by Jamal. Latika chuckles as she sees Jamal slip a 50 rupee note into his pocket. Punnoose signals Salim to take a cloth and a bottle of chloroform, but Salim, grabbing the bottle, unexpectedly throws its contents at Punnoose's face. Seizing the moment, Salim, Jamal, and Latika flee.\n\nThe trio dashes through a forest, pursued by Maman, Punnoose, and the bearded henchmen. They reach a railway siding and race after a train that's pulling away. Salim, in the lead, catches the last carriage, followed by Jamal who also grabs a hold. Latika, still chasing the train, is nearly caught as the men close in on her. Salim extends his hand to help her, their fingers touch, but he suddenly withdraws, leaving Latika on the tracks. Maman quickly reaches her, lifting her away.\n\nOn the train, Jamal appears stunned and looks around the dimly lit carriage where men lie watching them. Meanwhile, Punnoose holds onto Latika as Maman keeps his eyes on the departing train. Later, on a game show, the host scrutinizes Jamal. In a police station, Jamal sits, reflecting.\n\nFlashback to young Salim and Jamal perched on the roof of the moving train. Salim, sensing Jamal's pensiveness, wraps an arm around him consolingly. The brothers begin to sell various goods to passengers, from fruit and nuts to balloons. Salim counts their daily earnings as Jamal daydreams, haunted by the image of young Latika left standing on the tracks as the train moved away. The boys are seen chatting on the buffers between carriages as the train traverses through lush forests and vast stretches of the Indian countryside. They continue selling trinkets to passengers and sleep in sacks of vegetables, only to be roused and thrown off the train by the guard.\n\nLater, Salim is heard on the roof of another train, pulling Jamal up with a rope. As the train races through the countryside, the two brothers, now on the roof, doze while tightly gripping each other's hands, their journey far from over.",
    "649": "Salim dangles Jamal by the legs out of a train window. Inside the carriage, a family indulges in a feast of pickles, rice, vegetables, and chapati. A young boy, adorned with a turban, catches Jamal in the act of stealing chapatis through the window and alerts his father by nudging him and pointing. The father seizes Jamal through the window, but Jamal clings desperately to the window frame. Amidst a violent tug from the father, Jamal loses his grip and falls from the train, inadvertently pulling Salim with him. The brothers roll down a slope adjacent to the speeding train, eventually sitting up, gasping for breath. Jamal gazes at the horizon, where the dust settles to reveal the stunning, white marble Taj Mahal in the distance. Awestruck, the boys enter through the ground gates, mesmerized by the architectural splendor. Jamal's attention shifts to the numerous pairs of shoes left by tourists, from which he and Salim each steal a pair of trainers. A sign nearby requests visitors to collect receipts for guided tours. Jamal leans against a doorway as crowds of tourists stream past into the Taj Mahal. A middle-aged couple approaches Jamal, and the man gives him some money, which Jamal quickly pockets. Outside, Jamal captures Polaroid photos of tourists, while Salim pilfers their shoes during the photo sessions. The boys later sell these shoes from a store. At night, Jamal and Salim enjoy smoking a hookah and drinking with friends around a campfire; Salim sports fancy leather cowboy boots. During the day, Jamal hustles tourists as a guide while Salim counts stacks of cash. Jamal photographs an Asian tourist outside the Taj and shows her an image of Princess Diana at the same location. Security guards soon spot the boys and chase them away. Jamal leads a tourist couple to a riverside, while simultaneously, Salim and his gang break into the tourists' Mercedes taxi and strip its tires right as Jamal returns with the tourists. The Indian driver, infuriated, starts beating Jamal. The female tourist silently signals to her husband for money, and he hands Jamal a $100 bill. Jamal, nursing a black eye from the driver's punches, later kneels by a pool to soothe his injury. Drawn by music, Jamal looks toward its source and walks through a forest to an outdoor stage. There, Salim, Jamal, and their gang of urchins nimbly cross scaffolding above the audience, unnoticed as they steal handbags and purses from between the legs of spectators engrossed in the mesmerizing performance. Jamal, captivated, watches the singers on stage.",
    "654": "Peter gives a nod, his face displaying a foolish smile and a blank stare. He nods once more before turning to watch her as she departs with a small wave. With a look of dejection, Peter then proceeds to walk away down the street. \n\nUpon entering the apartment he shares with Harry, Peter finds Norman Osborne engaged in a phone conversation. He saunters over to Harry, who looks up at him. Harry, appearing slightly sheepish, turns towards both of them. He then reads about the Bugle's reward for a photograph of Spider-Man. \n\nAn armored car is being hoisted, and a camera is seen suspended in a web. Spider-Man makes a dynamic entrance, swiftly knocking down four robbers and executing a double move to flip another over his shoulder. He then kicks a gun out of a robber's hand and leaps onto him before turning towards the camera.\n\nA series of photographs captures Spider-Man swinging off a roof, crawling down a building, saluting the police, and looking directly at them, presented to J. Jonah Jameson, the editor of the Bugle. Peter hands over his photographs to a girl at a desk, who then writes him a check. Peter's camera is slung around his neck as he does this.\n\nMeanwhile, across the city in the high-rise Oscorp building, Norman is leading a meeting. He stands up to face the other ten board members, his gaze locking onto Henry Balkan sitting directly opposite him. The older man sips coffee, his eyes fixed on Norman, who wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. A lopsided grin crosses Norman's face.\n\nIn Times Square, amidst colorful balloons and costumed revelers, Peter is actively using his camera. He takes numerous shots, focusing his lens on a balcony high on a massive stone building where he spots Harry with MJ, who is adorned in a vibrant Chinese dress. Harry attempts to kiss MJ by touching her chin and leaning in, but she turns her head away. From below, Peter, with his neck craned, watches the scene unfold. MJ and Harry then move inside.\n\nPeter, feeling uneasy, looks around and senses something amiss. Harry encounters an Oscorp board member in a wheelchair. Peter, visibly disturbed, shifts his gaze upwards to the sky.\n\nBeyond the Times Square building, characterized by its singular wireless cubed top and surrounded by various advertising hoardings, an object moves towards the crowd, drawing everyone's attention upwards. Balkan observes the scene through binoculars. \n\nAstride a glider, a figure resembling a goblin, complete with a sharp-featured head, long pointy ears, large yellow eyes, a prominent nose, and bared teeth, navigates through the air. The glider circles the tall singular building before heading towards the balcony, weaving around giant balloon figures floating above the festival. The goblin, laughing, throws an object at the building, causing explosions that shatter the windows and destroy the floor below the balcony.",
    "656": "MJ smiles warmly, reminiscing about a cherished memory. Later, she engages in a phone conversation with Harry, while Peter, eavesdropping nearby, can't help but grin. Suddenly, MJ abruptly ends the call on Harry. Harry, sporting a bandage on his head, approaches Peter, his discomfort evident as he shifts and looks away. Peter ponders, a thoughtful expression crossing his face.\n\nAt the Osborn residence, Norman pours himself a drink from a decanter, taking a large gulp. Startled by a noise, he turns and moves as if entranced, scanning the room with uncertainty. His gaze fixes on a shelf along a wood-paneled wall where eerie masks seem to reach out. Norman stares at them intently, then spins around to face his reflection in a mirror, which chillingly begins to speak to him. As Norman locks eyes with his reflection, it chuckles ominously.\n\nMeanwhile, at the office, Hoffman is already present. A cigarette, previously discarded by Jameson out of the window, inexplicably flies back inside. Chaos erupts as the Green Goblin bursts into the room, seizing the editor by the throat. From outside the windows, vapor ominously seeps from the back of the Green Goblin's gloves directly into Spider-Man's face, causing him to go limp and plummet towards the ground. Swiftly, the Green Goblin, mounted on his glider, catches the unconscious Spider-Man and transports him to a rooftop. With a leap onto his glider, the Green Goblin shoots off into the night sky.\n\nAs night falls, MJ exits a door and discards an item into a bin. Peter rushes towards her, swallowing hard with nervousness. MJ responds with a gentle smile and a raised eyebrow, as the surrounding buildings are bathed in light. She dashes across Puddle Street and turns a corner, with Peter watching, his hair tousled by the wind, as two youths leer at her and begin to follow. The rain starts to fall, and MJ quickens her pace as the youths close in.\n\nOn a nearby rooftop, Peter is changing out of his everyday attire. Two more youths join the pursuit, cornering MJ in a backstreet. One of them grabs her shoulder, prompting MJ to fight back fiercely with her bag and feet. Amidst the struggle, one of the assailants brandishes a switchblade, but webs suddenly ensnare them, pulling them away from MJ.\n\nSpider-Man, his mask off, clings to a wall, then somersaults to the ground to confront the four attackers. With his superior strength, he overpowers them, sending two crashing through windows behind MJ. From the shadows, Spider-Man subdues the last assailant, then, as MJ approaches, he retreats down an alleyway, disappearing before she reaches it. Slinking down a wall head first, now with his mask on, he watches as MJ stares at her superhero. She reaches up, gently lifting the mask to reveal his neck, chin, and finally his lips.",
    "658": "As everyone enters his room, Peter is nowhere to be found. Norman steps further inside and notices Peter clinging to the ceiling, still in his costume. A drop of blood trickles down Peter's arm, poised to fall. The others leave Norman alone in Peter's room. As Norman turns to leave, the drop of blood hits the floor. With his enhanced hearing, Norman detects the sound of the drop landing. He surveys the room, spots the blood, and then looks up to the ceiling. Peter has vanished. Norman squints, then moves toward the open window. Leaning over the balcony, he scans both up and down.\n\nLater, Peter, now out of costume, enters through the front door. At the dining table, Norman sits at the head, with Peter positioned across from MJ and Harry. Aunt May places a large turkey before Norman. Norman fiddles with the sweet potatoes, licking his fingers, and casts a malevolent glance at the white-haired Aunt May. He picks up the carving knife, begins to sharpen it with a sneer on his face. Aunt May notices blood seeping through Peter's shirt, and Norman glares at him, the knife's blade aimed directly at Peter. Norman then sets the knife down, stands up, and leaves the table. Harry chases after his father. The conversation is audible to everyone through the open door. MJ lowers her head, and Peter watches her as a disheartened Harry reenters the room.\n\nIn his living room, Norman converses with the Goblin mask. Meanwhile, Aunt May rests in her bedroom when an explosion suddenly obliterates the wall. The Green Goblin glides into the room, finding Aunt May leaning against her bed on the floor.\n\nSubsequently, Peter hurries into the hospital and dashes to her room, only to be pushed out shortly after. Leaning against the corridor wall, Peter is lost in thought, his bright blue eyes twitching nervously. He glances down one way of the corridor, then turns to look the other way. Sitting beside Aunt May's bed, he sees her sedated form. Gently taking her hand, Peter strokes it with his thumb. On the bedside cabinet sits a framed photograph of Aunt May, Uncle Ben, and himself, which Peter studies with a grim expression. He shifts his focus back to his aunt, swallowing before he speaks.\n\nThe following day, MJ visits, bringing flowers. The young redhead gazes at the peaceful figure on the bed. Sitting opposite each other, Peter stares directly into MJ's eyes. She offers a small smile, while Peter averts his gaze, nods, and then looks down at the floor. Unbeknownst to them, Aunt May's eyes are open, having overheard their conversation. She smiles briefly before closing her eyes again. MJ reaches out and gently takes Peter's hand.",
    "659": "As she reaches for the door, it swings open, revealing Harry, who steps inside with a bouquet of flowers in his hand. In that moment, MJ quickly withdraws her hand from Peter's grasp. Harry's gaze fixes on them, his face etched with disappointment. An awkward silence envelops the trio. Later that evening, Harry confidently strides into the dimly lit, arched Osborne living room. Attracted by distant voices, he moves towards the stairs, ascending the grand staircase with purpose. On the landing that encircles the room, his father, Norman, appears, leaning on the intricately wood-carved rail. Harry, spreading his arms wide, continues his ascent, his mood sullen. Norman, observing his son from above, shakes his head disapprovingly. Harry, feeling a mix of impatience and resignation, sighs deeply. A look of confusion crosses Harry's face as his father descends to meet him, ultimately enveloping him in a comforting embrace. Overcome with emotion, Harry closes his eyes as tears begin to form.\n\nElsewhere, Peter lies with his head resting on his aunt's hospital bed, his expression coy. Turning away thoughtfully, a sudden alarm causes him to look up. He finds himself at a hospital payphone, his eyes widening in shock. Nearby, MJ lies unconscious, her hair and nightclothes stirred by a stiff breeze, which eventually rouses her. She rises to her feet on a high metal platform overlooking the city lights and cautiously steps back to the edge, managing to keep her balance. Far below, vehicles stream across the Queensboro Bridge. MJ finds herself atop one of its towering steel structures.\n\nSuddenly, the Green Goblin approaches, gliding ominously over MJ as she ducks. She watches in horror as he moves toward a cable car filled with children and adults. With a ruthless attack, he launches a missile, obliterating the cable-car station and causing cars on the bridge to collide. From a nearby rooftop, Spider-Man witnesses the unfolding chaos. A massive metal wheel soars into the air, a cable snaps free, and the Roosevelt Island cable car begins to plummet. In a desperate act, the Green Goblin seizes the cable, stabilizing the falling car.\n\nPositioned on a web stretched between two flagpoles, Spider-Man begins to traverse down a building, pulling the web taut before launching himself into the air. He expertly shoots webs, navigating the steel girders until he lands on a metal strut. Above him, the Goblin menacingly holds MJ in one hand and the cable-car cable in the other. He lifts MJ, causing her slippers to fall to the ground below. As the cable car swings wildly in the wind, supported only by the Goblin's grip, he releases both MJ and the cable simultaneously. In the reflective spider eyes of Spider-Man's mask, one image shows MJ falling, and the other depicts the cable car filled with screaming, terrified children. With swift action, Spider-Man dashes along the girder, leaps into the air, and spins down to catch MJ, then swings under the span to ensnare the cable car in his web, saving them all.",
    "660": "Spider-Man skillfully secures a network of webs to a bridge, anchoring a cable car that dangles precariously below. Inside the swaying car, the tension is palpable as the web struggles to support the weight of MJ, Spider-Man, and the vehicle itself. Suddenly, a section of the web snaps, causing everything to plummet 20 feet. In a desperate bid for safety, MJ scrambles over Spider-Man and begins her descent down the cable.\n\nAs they struggle, the sound of the Green Goblin's glider alerts Spider-Man and MJ; they look up to see their nemesis approaching. The Goblin, noticing a nearby tugboat, briefly diverts his attention. However, his focus quickly returns as he speeds past Spider-Man, delivering a punch that sends the hero reeling and dislodging the cable from his grip. Spider-Man manages to catch the cable again, but MJ loses her footing, slipping off. She manages to grab the rail around the cable car's roof just in time.\n\nThe Green Goblin, intent on finishing them off, swoops in for the kill as Spider-Man painstakingly lowers the cable car towards a barge. A blade from the Goblin's arsenal shoots out, but debris hurled by the crowd on the bridge strikes him, knocking him off balance. Seizing the moment, Spider-Man kicks the Goblin away. Amidst the chaos, the cable car safely reaches the barge, with MJ still clinging to it. As she looks up, she sees Spider-Man, her hero, but also spots the Goblin closing in once more.\n\nIn a swift move, the Goblin ensnares Spider-Man with a line around his waist, dragging him away behind the glider. Spider-Man crashes through the wall of an old ruin, quickly steadying himself with a web. His momentum carries him through a pane of glass, only to be met by a rolling pumpkin bomb. The ensuing fireball hurls him back through a brick wall, and he lands hard on the ground, half his mask burnt away.\n\nThe Goblin reappears, launching a vicious assault on Spider-Man, pummeling him with punches to the chest and face, followed by kicks and more punches. A powerful blow sends Spider-Man soaring into the air, landing with a heavy thud. Undeterred, the Goblin flips up to deliver yet another punch. Spider-Man, fighting to regain control, shoots out a web in an attempt to escape, but the Goblin thwarts it. Spider-Man then unleashes multiple threads, creating a large web that briefly slows the Goblin but fails to hold him.\n\nDetermined, Spider-Man launches an offensive, only to be beaten back by the Goblin's relentless attack. A brutal kick to the head and a drop kick to the chest send Spider-Man crashing into a brick wall, where he collapses to the ground. In a last-ditch effort, Spider-Man raises his wrist, but the Goblin stomps down on it, pinning him. With fierce determination, Spider-Man's eyes flare, and he grits his teeth as the Goblin lunges at him with a multi-bladed spear. Spider-Man manages to stop the spear just inches from his face, pushing it back and hurling the Goblin across the ruin. As the Goblin scrambles to recover, Spider-Man quickly wraps webs around his ankles and yanks him down, decisively gaining the upper hand.",
    "661": "Two additional webs yank a wall down onto Spider-Man, forcing him to retreat. From beneath the collapsed debris, a hand emerges, followed by the Green Goblin's head and torso. He struggles to his feet, unsteady. Swiftly, Spider-Man descends, dragging the villain through a trellis and slamming him against another wall. Spider-Man then unleashes a barrage of blades upon his opponent, causing the Green Goblin to collapse to the ground.\n\nThe Green Goblin removes his hard mask, revealing Norman Osborn beneath. Staring in disbelief, Peter, who is Spider-Man, watches as Norman presses a remote on his glove. With a sneer, the Goblin activates the glider, its blades aimed at Spider-Man. Spider-Man performs a backward flip over the approaching glider, which then veers toward Norman. The glider's blades impale Norman, pinning him against the wall. As Norman leans on the glider, he looks up at Peter, whose face is now visible through his torn mask. Norman slumps over the glider, his eyes wide and staring, with the Green Goblin mask lying discarded beside him on the ground. Peter bows his head in sorrow.\n\nLater, in the dark, Peter carries Norman, now out of costume, and lays him on the sofa in the Osborn mansion study. As he does this, Harry, clad in black, enters the room and sees his father and the shadowy figure of Spider-Man. Harry frantically searches the desk and retrieves a gun. When he looks up again, Spider-Man has vanished, leaving the net curtains fluttering in the wind through the open window.\n\nAt Norman's funeral, after the burial, Harry stands alone until Peter, hands in pockets, slowly approaches. Harry turns and acknowledges his friend with a nod. Peter, fixated on Harry, steps forward and embraces him tightly. They part, and Harry turns away, leaving Peter to solemnly watch him walk down the path through the gravestones toward a waiting Rolls-Royce. The bare trees around them have shed their autumn leaves. Turning, Peter sees MJ and Aunt May. He stands before his uncle's gravestone, where MJ joins him and hugs him. They cling to each other, but MJ soon pulls away, and they stand facing each other. She gently strokes his cheek with her gloved hand, and he gazes at her intently.\n\nIn the midst of the graveyard, tears streaming down her windblown face, MJ draws Peter's head towards her. Their lips meet in a long, passionate kiss. The embrace ends, and they study each other's faces, tears welling in MJ's eyes. As she closes her eyes, the tears cascade down her cheeks. Sadly, Peter turns from her and begins to walk away slowly. MJ, left standing by the gravestone, weeps. Suddenly, as if remembering something, she touches her lips with her hand.",

The scene transitions to pages of comic magazines displaying the words \"bap,\" \"boom,\" and finally, \"marvel.\" A ray of blue light pierces the screen, followed by the announcement that Tobey Maguire stars in the film.\n\nThe visual then shifts to a surreal sequence where one appears to be punching through a red, smoky tunnel reminiscent of an archery's interior, yet a spider's web remains persistently visible. A muscular arm and a clenched hand become entangled in the web, with the hand reaching up to grasp more silk threads. The scene intensifies as a sharp-featured head, resembling more of a mask with long pointed ears, a humped nose, barred teeth, and a jutting jaw, emerges. The opening titles continue against an animated backdrop of skyscrapers.\n\nTwo hands delicately touch fingertips to fingertips, and the image rotates to reveal a window frame. The scene shifts to a large guy casually eating a doughnut. A youth with dark hair and spectacles chases after a yellow school bus. The bus stops, allowing the youth to climb aboard. Timothy, a pasty-faced young man, proceeds down the aisle of the bus. A girl with her hair in bunches and wearing large spectacles places her books on the empty seat beside her. Flash Thompson, his arm around Mary Jane, nods to another student, while the doughnut eater shakes his head in response.\n\nAs young Parker walks down the bus aisle, his eyes remain fixed on Mary Jane, oblivious to a leg stuck out in front of him. He tumbles to the floor, his spectacles falling off, while the yellow school bus continues its journey. Outside Columbia University, as Parker approaches Mary Jane, she smiles and waves. He waves back shyly, only to realize she was greeting girlfriends walking behind him. A Rolls Royce pulls out, and a sulky young man clambers out to confront Parker. Peter and Harry turn away from the scene.\n\nPeter, now with his camera in hand, points it to take a photo, but Flash Thompson bumps into him. Harry crosses over to Mary Jane, and Peter overhears their conversation. Harry turns to Peter and grins. Above them, a spider observes. A teacher leads Harry away, leaving Peter to stare at the inquisitive Mary Jane. She stands in front of a display of spiders contained in transparent plastic cages. Peter watches her with wide, forlorn eyes as she moves to the side of the display. He finds himself standing in front of a TV monitor.\n\nMeanwhile, a super spider, missing from its cage, begins to descend on a silky thread from its newly spun web. Mary Jane continues to pose, holding some notes and pointing to them. The spider inches its way down towards Peter. As it settles on his hand, Mary Jane's friend calls to her, prompting her to turn and leave. The spider bites Peter, who quickly shakes it off. The spider lands on the gray, carpeted floor and scuttles away. Peter examines the bite, noticing a circle of red surrounding the already swollen area on the back of his hand.",

At the Quest Proving Grounds in bunker six, a vehicle arrives, and General Slocum steps out. The two men then proceed into the bunker where an exoskeleton is activated. Captain Curtis stands within a 10-feet tall rocket that soon launches, transforming into a green fireball. A shape advances toward the bunker, leading to total destruction.\n\nAt a graduation ceremony, photographs are taken of Peter's classmates. Harry turns to his father, and they shake hands. Peter, dressed in his mortarboard and gown, stands awkwardly nearby. He spots MJ with Flash, then parts from the group, nodding stiffly and offering a weak smile. Later, Peter and Aunt May arrive home. Peter is dressed in a suit, shirt, and tie, while Aunt May wears a floral suit, hat, and carries her gloves. Peter briskly ascends the stairs to his room, and Aunt May follows with a few steps, her head tilted to one side, watching him with a sad yet witty expression until he's out of sight.\n\nThat night, Peter sits in his bedroom with his tie slightly loosened. Tears slowly trace down his cheeks as he gazes into the distance. Aunt May, in her dressing gown, softly enters and sits beside him on the bed, her hands resting on her lap. He acknowledges her presence with a faint smile. She leans close, placing her hands on his shoulders, and he smiles in return. Aunt May rises, gently squeezes his left shoulder with her right hand, and then leaves. Left alone, Peter sinks into deep thought before a spark ignites in his eyes.\n\nHe opens a small case to reveal a sweatshirt adorned with a spider and web motif. Beneath it lies a sketchpad displaying the original design of the snug-fitting Spider-Man outfit—a blue body stocking, a hooded mask, red and black checked shoulder pants, and a large black spider on the chest.\n\nOn the streets of New York City, a delicatessen run by an Oriental couple is being robbed. As the robbers attempt their escape, Spider-Man swoops down on them, recovering the stolen money and leaving the robbers caught in a giant spider web. Nearby, a girl faces a gunman.\n\nThe front page of the Daily Bugle features these events. MJ, exiting the Moon Dance Diner in her waitress outfit, puts on her coat. Peter, standing on the sidewalk, senses her presence, turns, and chases after her. They share an awkward glance as Enrique returns to the diner. MJ opens her coat, revealing her uniform to Peter.",
    "674": "Peter turns his head, noticing a blazing apartment building. Driven by urgency, he dashes towards it, his movements swift and determined. At the curb, he pauses, clutching at the neck of his shirt as if about to tear it open, but then he stops, gazes up at the raging fire, and steps back cautiously. Undeterred, Peter sprints across the street and charges into the inferno. Inside the burning structure, he disregards the encroaching flames, dashing up the stairs as more timbers collapse ominously around him. Quickly assessing the situation, he hears desperate screams, propelling him to action.\n\nUpon reaching a locked door, Peter cups his hands to his mouth, then forcefully charges at it with his shoulder. Facing the stubborn barrier, he raises his foot and delivers a powerful kick, causing the door to clatter to the floor. He rushes into the apartment where burning timbers are falling from the ceiling. Inside, he finds a girl, and amidst falling debris, he firmly presses his hand on her head, lifting her with his other hand onto the landing. A chunk of the structure falls out of the landing as he maneuvers her to safety. Outside, the girl, now on her knees, assists Peter to gain firm footing. He picks her up again, and they continue their escape as more burning beams crash around them. Her anguished parents, hearing the internal crashes, witness Peter emerging with their daughter. He hands her over to her bemused parents before walking away, leaving the scene as the flames are extinguished. Standing in the road, an oxygen mask on his face, Peter watches as two firemen cross his path. With a somber expression, he turns away, lost in thought.\n\nLater, at his room window framed by weather-worn wood needing paint, Peter is deep in reflection. A door opens behind him, and Ursula, a tall, scrawny girl with pigtails, steps outside before returning inside. She goes out again, and subsequently sits on the end of his bed, watching as he finishes his meal. He lays his fork on the plate, and she rises to collect it from him. He hands her his empty glass, and they stand facing each other. On her way out, she pauses, handing him a note before taking the plates and glasses with her as she leaves. Peter's attention is now fixed on the note.\n\nAt Aunt May's house, Peter walks down the passageway to the back garden where Aunt May is packing. She looks up, sees him, and continues her work, a smile spreading across her face as she approaches and wraps her arms around him in a close hug, her eyes closed. Peter looks solemn as she releases her hold and stares at him. She nods, then moves away, bending down to pick up a brown paper carrier bag and wiping a tear from her eye. Peter surveys the boxes scattered around the back garden, his expression bewildered, his demeanor sulking as his eyes glaze over with the weight of his thoughts.",
    "679": "In a gripping sequence, a frightened Harry yanks open a hinged portrait, quickly dials a combination, and accesses a safe concealed behind it. Inside, he discovers a massive orb. Suddenly, a limb shoves Harry aside, clearing the way for Octavius. With purpose, Octavius approaches the safe, removes his dark sunglasses, and scrutinizes the tritium within.\n\nHarry's gaze locks onto Spider-Man before he whirls around, only to see that Octavius has already seized the tritium sphere and is making his exit via the balcony. With a dark and brooding expression, Harry grabs a hefty ornamental dagger from the nearby desk. He presses the dagger against his chest and advances toward the unconscious Spider-Man, who lies on his back on a couch, his arms and hands tightly bound in front of him. As Spider-Man watches, Harry lifts the dagger, abruptly removes the mask, and then recoils in shock before dropping the weapon. Peter, regaining strength, snaps the bonds and rises to his feet, moving towards Harry, who responds with a shake of his head and tears in his eyes as he sits and looks up at Peter.\n\nIn a reconstructed lab down by the pier, Octavius stands within the fusion chamber, intently examining the tritium. Nearby, MJ is shackled to a pillar. Octavius, lowering his dark glasses, taps on a keyboard, triggering beams of light to emerge within the chamber. The tritium begins to glow intensely, casting light that guides Spider-Man as he stealthily maneuvers across a beam. Sensing Spider-Man's presence, Octavius grins maliciously. Spider-Man pauses directly above MJ, who looks up, smiles briefly, but her expression fades upon turning to see Octavius.\n\nSuddenly, a limb smashes into the pillar, prompting Spider-Man to climb away. He then leaps over Octavius and his limbs, only to be caught and hurled upward, crashing through the ceiling and out into the night sky. Spider-Man quickly shoots a web onto a building, swinging back inside through a large oil window and landing squarely on Octavius. Their struggle sends them crashing through the floorboards into the water below, where they exchange blows.\n\nAmidst the chaos, the tritium sphere starts attracting metal, including MJ's chains. Suspended in the air, MJ clings to the ropes as the pillar she was tied to buckles, freeing the ropes. She finds herself being pulled towards the sphere. Spider-Man, reacting swiftly, attaches a web to the rope and struggles to pull MJ away from the glowing tritium. The chains on MJ's legs eventually break, catapulting her back towards Spider-Man.\n\nWith renewed vigor, Octavius goes on a rampage, throwing Spider-Man against a metal beam. Spider-Man crashes to the floor, and as MJ watches helplessly, rubble falls on top of him. Octavius strides over, and one of his limbs lifts Spider-Man, suspending him mid-air. Meanwhile, MJ grabs a piece of timber, sneaks up on Octavius, and is about to strike when a limb punches her away. In a swift motion, one of Octavius's pincers flicks out a blade, escalating the tension of their confrontation.",
    "680": "In a chaotic battle, two webs are employed to lift a power cable as a makeshift shield. Suddenly, the pincer of a mechanical limb pierces the cable, causing a massive surge of electricity to shoot through the limb to Octavius. Amidst the chaos, Spider-Man desperately pulls at more cables, eventually succeeding and sending both himself and Octavius flying through the air.\n\nAs Spider-Man surveys the severed cables, he notices a glowing sphere that continues to attract metal objects. Positioning himself before it, hands spread apart, he watches helplessly as more of the lab's structure gets sucked into the sphere. Outside, the streets of New York witness lamp posts, taxis, and cars being drawn towards the building, all pulled by the powerful magnet of the tritium.\n\nRegaining consciousness in a pool of water, Octavius is soon approached by Spider-Man, who hears a waterlogged limb and rushes over. With a puzzled expression, Octavius watches as Spider-Man removes his mask. More metal objects are drawn into the sphere as a submerged limb rises, changing Octavius' expression. In a sudden move, a limb wraps its pincer around Peter's neck, and Octavius nods with an eerie calmness, his limbs resembling serpents with closed pincers. His dark eyes gleam momentarily before he blinks and raises an eyebrow.\n\nAs more debris is pulled into the sphere, the limbs shift their focus menacingly towards Octavius' face. The grip on Peter's neck loosens, and another limb intervenes. With Spider-Man's mask off, the four limbs lift Octavius and carry him towards the golden orb in the fusion chamber. Just before reaching it, the limbs halt, and Octavius turns, his face set in grim determination. The two men exchange a long, intense stare before Octavius abruptly turns and charges towards the sphere.\n\nSpider-Man, unmasked, spins around to see MJ's astonished face as she recognizes him, her smile breaking out joyfully. Peter watches her fondly but soon spots beams and a girder collapsing. As an entire side of the building comes crashing down towards her, he sprints forward and strains to hold it up, bending under its massive weight. MJ lies on the floor with him towering above her, his intense gaze fixed on her.\n\nMeanwhile, under the fusion chamber, Octavius looks up at the sphere and uses the limbs to remove the support girders, causing the chamber and lab to start sinking. Peter continues to struggle, holding up the crumbling side wall, nodding determinedly. The chamber then crashes into the river below, taking the sphere and Octavius with it. Exerting all his strength, Peter throws the side wall after it, then reaches down to MJ, removing a wooden beam trapping her. As they turn, a revolving mass of metal speeds towards them. Holding MJ tightly, Peter leaps up and uses a web to carry them away from the sinking laboratory.",
    "681": "At the office, the gum-chewing receptionist, looking bored, glances at the clock, noting it's three minutes past two. Meanwhile, Peter, his expression unflinching, carefully unties the fasteners holding his pizzas together, one by one. He looks up at the receptionist before heading back towards the janitor's cupboard from where he had emerged. The receptionist watches Peter with suspicion as he turns towards the elevators he had just passed. Peter presses the elevator button, and as the doors open, he steps inside, pressing another button. Before the doors close, he gives the receptionist a friendly smile and a wave.\n\nBack at Joe's Pizza, Mister Aziz confronts a young, eager-looking Peter. Aziz steps towards him, reaching for Peter's helmet and forcefully removes the Joe's Pizza sticker from it. Later, at the Bugle, Peter hands over a chitty. Miss Brant playfully chucks his chin and walks away, leaving Peter to smile self-consciously.\n\nOn the university campus, Peter runs and accidentally collides with a student. As he bends to retrieve his book, another student steps on his books, and bags from others hit him. Rising, Peter notices Doctor Connors, who walks past, stops, and then turns. Connors, with his thin face and furrowed brow, continues walking, his right coat sleeve empty.\n\nAs night falls, Peter rides his moped into a garden surrounded by a wooden, suburban hedge. He enters the house, removing his helmet, satchel, and jacket. Inside, he stares at Harry Osborn, who watches MJ leave. Harry frowns at Peter, who returns a flat stare. When Peter doesn't respond, Harry stands, hands on hips, and walks away. He looks at a framed photograph of his father with Peter. In a gesture of comfort, Peter places a hand on Harry's shoulder. Suddenly, the lights go out, and Peter blows out the candles on his birthday cake.\n\nLater that night, Aunt May is asleep at the table, surrounded by letters and papers. Peter walks around the table and gently takes hold of her hand. Aunt May reaches into her purse, and tears well up in Peter's eyes as she kisses him on the cheek and walks away. Peter struggles to hold back his tears as he takes the litter out into the backyard in a plastic bin bag. He strides to the bottom of the garden, not noticing MJ sitting on the steps of the neighboring house. MJ walks towards him, and as she leans over the fence, Peter gazes at her. Their eyes lock, and they stand as if transfixed. Peter starts to speak, but shakes his head, his eyes flitting from hers to her mouth. MJ stares at him expectantly. Again, Peter shakes his head, lowering his eyes while MJ keeps hers fixed on him. He looks up again, attempting a smile.",
    "688": "In the bustling interior of a bank, Peter is present when the atmosphere shifts suddenly. Aunt May, with a swift kick, strikes the bank clerk. Clutching a newspaper cutting, she examines it intently. Meanwhile, the bank clerk, seemingly unaffected, smiles, stands, and limps away. Across the banking hall, Octavius, cloaked in a long coat and a triveil, stands ominously before the steel vault door.\n\nWith a menacing whirl, Octavius turns, his face animated by a devious smile as he strides into the crumbling building, accompanied by his mechanical limbs. A pincer menacingly approaches him, and the limbs promptly lift him off the ground; he responds by opening his arms. Octavius then tosses an object across the hall, causing Aunt May's mouth to drop open in astonishment.\n\nPeter, sensing danger, dashes around the corner, leaving the bank clerk by Aunt May's side. With his mechanical limbs, Octavius forcefully moves through the guards. One of his pincers smoothly removes his hat before beginning the methodical task of collecting bulging sacks of money from the vault, stuffing them into yellow bags. Suddenly, one of the pincers detects an anomaly, prompting Octavius to glance around warily.\n\nInto this tense scene, Spider-Man swings in, immediately becoming a target as Octavius hurls bags at him. Agilely, Spider-Man swings up to the ceiling, skillfully catching a bag in his web which hits Octavius, prompting him to spin around and toss more bags. Landing on a wall without the aid of a web, Spider-Man is soon struck by a bag of coins. A gold coin rolls over to the bank clerk, who is about to pocket it when Aunt May swiftly smacks him.\n\nThe confrontation escalates as Octavius' metal limbs seize Spider-Man, two of them grabbing his head and beginning to squeeze. In a desperate move, Spider-Man fires a web, aiming at the desk and the display case overhead. The limbs smash the desk, and the display case, dislodged, strikes Octavius, propelling him out of the bank and onto a yellow cab. Quickly regaining his footing, Octavius uses his limbs to hurl Spider-Man back into the bank.\n\nAs the situation outside the bank escalates, two police cars screech to a halt. In a desperate move, one of the mechanical limbs grabs Aunt May, using her as a shield as Octavius lumbers away with her. In an office nearby, a girl, having just finished a phone call, lays down the receiver and moves to the window, only to see a limb poking through the wall. Outside, Octavius is seen hammering up the exterior of the office building, three of his limbs engaged in the work while the fourth holds Aunt May captive.\n\nSpider-Man appears above, just as Octavius, high up the building, drops Aunt May. Swiftly, a web from Spider-Man catches her, snapping her back up to safety. Below, Octavius brutally crashes Spider-Man against the building, yet Spider-Man, astonishingly, continues to fight back. Breaking free from Octavius' grip, Spider-Man climbs higher but is soon grabbed again by one of the mechanical limbs. Aunt May watches in horror as Spider-Man is hauled down by Octavius.\n\nThe battle intensifies as the two adversaries exchange blows and then leap off the building, plummeting toward the ground. In a final desperate move, one of the mechanical limbs secures a firm hold, leaving the outcome hanging in the balance.",
    "691": "In the early morning, the hazy sunlight bathes the New York skyline, casting a soft glow over the city. Inside his modest apartment, Peter stands at a payphone, deeply engrossed in his thoughts. Meanwhile, at her home, Mary Jane gazes intently at her phone, her expression one of anticipation and concern. She reaches for the phone, only to find that Peter has already hung up. Frustrated, Peter spins around and quickly picks up the receiver again.\n\nIn a tense scene at the police station, Captain Stacy places a mugshot of a suspect on the table in front of Aunt May. Peter, driven by emotion, quickly grabs the photograph. His mind drifts to a black and white flashback where he sees his Uncle Ben sitting in his car on a dark, foreboding street. Suddenly, Flint, armed and menacing, taps on the driver's window with his gun. The confrontation escalates as Flint forcefully pushes Uncle Ben to the ground. An accomplice rushes up, but Flint shoves him away. The accomplice seizes the opportunity, jumping into Uncle Ben's car. In a chilling moment, Flint fires his gun, fatally shooting Uncle Ben. As the accomplice speeds away, leaving Flint at the scene, a single tear rolls down Peter's cheek as he envisions the tragic event.\n\nBack at his apartment, Peter angrily throws the mugshot of Flint onto his desk and sits, brooding deeply as he taps his finger restlessly. The silence is broken by the sudden blare of his radio, prompting Peter to wrench open the door and quickly turn down the volume. The tension in the room is palpable as Mary Jane, visibly hurt and angry, shoots Peter a piercing look before pursing her lips and heading toward the door, pulling it open with a forceful tug. Peter, his expression hardened and unmasked, increases the radio's volume again and stands brooding, lost in thought.\n\nLater, Peter transforms into his Spider-Man suit, his gaze fixed on the radio amidst a collection of photos of Mary Jane, Uncle Ben, and Aunt May. He leans his head against the doorpost, overcome with morose reflection. As he lies on his bed, lightning flashes outside, replaying the attack on his uncle in his mind. A mysterious creature begins to crawl across the floor, catching Peter's attention briefly before he settles back into a troubled sleep. An unseen presence moves silently across the room, up onto the bed, casting eerie, tangled shadows on the wall. In his dream, Peter sees Uncle Ben face-to-face with his killer, the moment filled with dread.\n\nAs he sleeps, shiny black tendrils start to latch onto Peter's hand, spreading up his arm and enveloping his Spider-Man suit like dark ivy climbing a tree. Peter's hands grip the sheets tightly as the alien growth continues to spread across his torso and eventually covers his face, his eyes opening wide in horror at the transformation.\n\nNow completely covered in the new black Spider-Man suit, Peter hangs upside down from a skyscraper, his reflection visible in a dark, mirrored window. He drops onto his feet on a ledge, taking a moment to closely examine his transformed appearance. Clenching his fingers, he then flips up the side of the building and leaps into the air, swinging from a thread. He swoops low between a line of cars and ascends to a high roof adorned with lanterns. Clinging to one of the large lanterns, Peter looks out over the city, finally pulling off his black hood, revealing the conflicted hero beneath.",
    "692": "In a science lab, a small black globule escapes from a microscope and quickly moves towards Peter. He swiftly traps it under a glass. Upon returning home, Peter approaches his Spider-Man suit, which hangs on a rail, but hesitates as he notices a battered black trunk on the floor. Crouching, he opens the trunk to reveal a black spider suit inside, which he contemplates for a moment. Soon after, the black-suited Spider-Man leaps from a skyscraper, a thread shooting out from his wrist as he swings across the city.\n\nAn overturned taxi sits in front of a bank with blown-open doors. Black Spider-Man lands on the street and spots a trail of sand slithering down a grating. As he tears a heavy grill from the ground, Eddie Brock emerges from a camp, ready to capture the moment with his camera. Spider-Man, however, smashes Brock's camera and then jumps down the manhole. Brock, glaring down the shaft, takes out a smaller camera as escort cars begin to arrive.\n\nIn a subway tunnel, Flint Marko walks along the tracks, carrying two clear sacks of banknotes. Unbeknownst to him, a flash of light briefly illuminates Black Spider-Man crawling along the ceiling behind him. Flint turns and looks up, but the light vanishes, leaving him seeing nothing, so he continues walking. Suddenly, Black Spider-Man appears upside down in front of him. A brief scuffle ensues, and Spider-Man touches the stripes on a train before leaping onto Flint, causing him to tumble off the track into a deep tunnel, dropping the money onto a track far below. Black Spider-Man swings at Flint with a thread, taking him to the park of a train. Swinging away to an archway, Black Spider-Man drop-kicks Flint into the side of a train. He then rubs Flint's head against the passing train, grinding it away like cheese on a grater. Flint, dropping to his knees, briefly transforms into Sandman, sending Black Spider-Man ricocheting between two passing trains. Spider-Man strikes Flint, dislodging sandy lumps from his face. Both fall down a white shaft, landing on a pipe that breaks under their weight.\n\nFlint lands in a muddy puddle near his money. As he reaches for it, he discovers his arm has turned into damp sand and recoils in horror, watching his hand disintegrate. Above, Black Spider-Man lands on a ledge and swings down onto a huge water pipe, which he tears apart. Jets of water burst from the red holes, and Flint, watching in horror, is swept away by a torrent of water down the concrete's loose. He slams against a grating, the rushing water dissolving his sandy body.",
    "699": "A short while after, Peter retrieves a suitcase from beneath his bed and unlatches it, exposing his red and blue Spider-Man suit. He lifts it up, his gaze fixed tranquilly on the spider emblem stretching across the suit's ribbed web pattern. His previously anxious eyes now calm down.\n\nMeanwhile, in his mansion, Harry switches off the television and begins to pace by a crackling fire, his hand pressed against his forehead. He comes to a halt before his father's portrait and half-turns his head to look at Peter, now in his Spider-Man suit but maskless. Fully facing Peter, the glow from the fireplace illuminates Harry, unveiling severe burns on his right cheek and a scar traversing his eye and throat. His expression remains impassive as he looks at Peter and then shakes his head in refusal. Feeling rebuffed, Peter turns away and exits via the balcony.\n\nDown in the goblin lair, Harry retrieves the green goblin sword from amidst the scattered debris on the floor. With the marred side of his face shrouded in shadow, a tear sparkles in his undamaged eye as he nods solemnly. Bernard, observing quietly, begins to withdraw discreetly.\n\nAbove the bustling streets of New York, a massive searchlight illuminates a yellow cab trapped in a high web. Inside the ensnared cab, Mary Jane scans her surroundings with nervous glances. The cab sways and then descends rapidly down the web, resembling a fish spilling out of a net, until it settles on a lower web.\n\nAmid a large crowd, a little girl points upwards, prompting others to turn their heads in the direction of Spider-Man swinging towards them on a thread. Spider-Man leaps onto a building, the American flag waving behind him, before propelling himself towards the scene. He swings around a lamppost, passing reporter Jennifer Dugan, and launches himself through the air with the city's night lights twinkling all around. He lands on the bonnet of the yellow cab.\n\nSuddenly, Venom swings into Spider-Man, knocking him through the windshield and tearing off the cab's roof. Spider-Man scrambles onto the boot of the car as Venom's mask peels off like writhing snakes, revealing Brock. Brock seizes Mary Jane and sends Spider-Man tumbling to a lower web. With his wrists bound to the web by webbing shot by Brock, who then lands atop him and removes Spider-Man's mask, Peter's eyes widen in horror. Above them, a truck suspending breeze blocks begins to unload, the blocks raining down like massive hailstones and ripping a door from the cab.\n\nInside the cab, Mary Jane attempts to shift a lodged breeze block. Meanwhile, Peter fights to break free from his restraints. As the symbiote mask envelops Brock's face once more, Mary Jane lifts the heavy breeze block over her head and then releases it, striking the snarling Venom directly on the head.",
    "702": "Harry extends his hand, which Peter grips tightly. Nodding, Harry helps Peter to his feet, and they quickly spin around to confront their adversaries. Suddenly, Venom lunges at Peter, but Harry uses Peter as a makeshift club, striking Sandman forcefully. Flames erupt from Harry's sky stick, blasting Sandman's arm and causing it to shatter like fragile glass when the monster attempts to seize Harry.\n\nBelow, amidst the crowd, Jameson struggles to capture the scene with his camera, only to find it devoid of film. Frustrated, he shoots a sharp glare at a nearby girl.\n\nDodging Sandman's colossal fists, Peter and Harry weave through the chaos. Above, a taxi plunges toward Mary Jane but narrowly misses her, leaving her clinging precariously by a mere thread. Harry and Peter, aboard the sky stick, maneuver deftly past the sandy behemoth to reach her. Just as the thread snaps and Mary Jane begins to fall, Peter expertly maneuvers the sky stick, enabling him to leap off and catch her in mid-air. Swinging away with Mary Jane securely in his arms, Peter lands on a half-constructed skyscraper to the roaring cheers of the crowd below, nodding solemnly through his tattered mask.\n\nAmidst the action, Sandman reaches for Harry, but Peter swiftly kicks sand into his eyes, momentarily disorienting him. Sandman, bewildered, swings a massive arm at Peter, launching him to an upper floor of the building, well out of reach. From there, Peter unleashes rockets from the sky stick, hitting Sandman and causing the giant sand creature to stagger, crumble, and disintegrate into a heap of dust, eliciting cheers from the onlookers.\n\nHigh atop the skyscraper, Peter, his Spider-Man mask severely torn and exposing his eyes and mouth, scans the area for Venom. As he turns, Venom ambushes him from above, slamming him into a girder. Peter collapses onto his face, and Venom swiftly binds his wrists with black threads, forcing him to his knees. With ruthless efficiency, Venom strikes Peter with an iron bar, hitting him repeatedly until the mask is completely ripped away. Holding a jagged metal bar to Peter's neck, Venom's tendrils cover Brock's face as he prepares to deliver a fatal blow. However, a pumpkin bomb interrupts, slicing into Venom.\n\nHarry ascends rapidly, but Venom snatches the sky stick, causing Harry to plummet. In a desperate move, Harry grabs a rack of long metal tubes, which clatter to the ground. Peter, still immobilized, watches as Venom, reacting to a sonic attack, partially disintegrates, reminding Peter of his own experience with the black suit and a bell. Venom, wielding the sky stick, leaps down toward Peter, but Harry steps in to shield him. Looking down in shock, Harry sees two blades piercing through his chest. With a brutal force, Venom lifts Harry into the air and discards him like a broken toy.",

Suddenly, red flashing lights flood the room, prompting Flint to march decisively towards the window. He then maneuvers out onto the fire escape, observed by Emma, Penny's mother, who watches his departure with a warm yet cynical expression.\n\nMeanwhile, Peter navigates a quiet street under the cover of darkness on his motorcycle. He comes to a stop outside Aunt May's apartment. Inside, Aunt May, her eyes shimmering with tears, gently brushes back a strand of her white hair. She solemnly removes her ring, which Peter gratefully accepts, their eyes meeting in a tender exchange, followed by a heartfelt smile from his aunt. They lean into a comforting embrace, their arms enveloping each other warmly.\n\nLater that night, Peter, sporting a silly grin, cruises along a city street. Out of nowhere, a figure clad in dark green descends on a hoverboard, seizing Peter and whisking him away to the rooftops. The masked assailant headbutts Peter and muffles his cries with a firm hand. Blades suddenly emerge from his forearms, and he viciously slashes at Peter's abdomen. Peter manages to break free from the hoverboard, swiftly shooting a web thread to anchor himself to a skyscraper. Swinging from this thread, he launches web balls at his attacker, who dodges and slices through Peter's lifeline. Peter plummets, only to be violently smashed into a high wall by his dark green-clad adversary.\n\nStunned and embedded in the wall, Peter gazes upward in a daze as his attacker, now hovering, slides back his visor. Peter narrowly evades a powerful punch. As the wall section he clings to is forcibly removed by Harry, Peter struggles to hold on as it falls toward the street below. Harry swiftly follows, shattering the chunk of wall into pieces. Peter attempts to swing away using a thread, but Harry relentlessly pursues, battering him like a ball on an elastic. Peter falls once more, only to be caught by Harry, who drags and slams him against the high walls during flight before hurling him through a corner of a window.\n\nAs Peter emerges from the other shattered window, he spots Aunt May's ring spinning in the air before him. He reaches out to grasp it but is seized from behind. Both men fiercely battle atop the narrow, sweeping Sky Stick hoverboard. Peter manages to dislodge Harry from the Sky Stick and fires web threads to propel himself downward in pursuit of the falling ring. The Sky Stick autonomously descends to rescue the falling Harry. Just as Peter snatches the ring, Harry strikes again, sending him tumbling onto a rooftop. Opening his fist, Peter gazes at the ring cradled in his palm before turning to flee as Harry descends once more.",
    "712": "In a rush, they enter a gymnasium through a door. Jack tenderly touches Rose's cheek, and she responds by placing her gloved hand over his. Rose then exits outside, and Jack, observing her departure through a wavy glass window, looks down afterward. Later, in the first-class lounge, Ruth, Rose, the Countess, and another woman enjoy tea. Rose's attention drifts to another table where a woman corrects a slouching young girl, who then delicately places a napkin on her lap with her small gloved hands. Jack, seeking balance, leans on a railing and gazes out to sea, his hair tousled by the wind. Rose approaches him across the deck, and Jack turns to face her with a smile. As Rose walks closer and reaches out, they clasp hands, and Jack gently draws her closer. Rose closes her eyes, and Jack, still holding her hand, assists her onto the bow's rail platform. Together, they step onto the lowest rung of the railing, and Rose spreads her arms out like wings, her shawl fluttering backward in the wind. Jack wraps his hands around her waist as she opens her eyes, with black smoke rising from the ship's funnels as they stand high above the water. Jack tenderly takes Rose's hands, leaning close to her, and then folds her arms around her waist. She turns his face toward hers, and they share a kiss, with Rose gently placing her hand on the back of Jack's neck.\n\nThe scene shifts to the sunken Titanic resting at the ocean's bottom. Elderly Rose, on a salvage vessel, turns away from a monitor to speak to the crew. She gazes back at the monitor displaying the underwater image of the fireplace in her former suite, which then transforms back to its past state as young Rose and Jack enter. Jack hurries to a painting, while Rose opens a safe and hands him the Heart of the Ocean necklace. Jack, examining the faceted blue diamond, shakes his head and then faces Rose. Later, Rose removes a butterfly cone from her hair and shakes it out to her shoulders. Jack moves a settee to the room's center, piling one pillow atop another. Sitting near it, Jack opens a canvas bag and takes out a knife and a thin stick of charcoal, which he sharpens. As Rose enters the room, holding a kimono closed with one hand and playfully twirling a sash, Jack smiles. Rose approaches him; he leans back, and she tosses him a dime. Stepping back, Rose lets the kimono slip from her shoulders to the floor, then, naked, runs her fingertips over her thigh.",

Jack races to the starboard railing, watching as the back of the ship moves alongside the iceberg.\n\nMurdoch sprints to the bridge and operates a lever, triggering the closure of the hydraulic watertight doors in the engine room. A man gestures to the stokers, prompting workers to run through the rising water and crawl under the descending doors. One man follows others through a doorway, but the door shuts, trapping several stokers behind. As the rest escape past the closing doors, the last remaining stoker makes a desperate dive under the final door and tumbles out just as its steel hatch slams shut. On the bridge, a row of lights on the watertight door indicator panel illuminates. Murdoch, after staring at the panel, turns away.\n\nOn the passenger deck, a man and a woman lean over the starboard rail, peering at the iceberg. In the crow's nest, Fleet turns to Lee. Jack, Rose, and the two men observe the iceberg from over the railing, now positioned behind the ship. On the bridge, Murdoch speaks to Moody, who glances at a wall clock as he leaves. Hichens turns toward the bridge door as Captain Smith enters. Murdoch follows Smith onto the bridge deck, where Smith looks down from the bridge deck shelter before standing at the bridge railing, overlooking the front well deck. Murdoch quickly departs.\n\nIn his cabin, Fabrizio leaps from his bunk into inch-deep water and switches on the overhead light. His roommates follow as he opens the door. Tommy approaches. The countess emerges from her stateroom and halts a mustached steward. Andrews rushes past, clutching blueprints. Smoke billows from the ship's massive funnels as people congregate on the decks. Tommy, Fabrizio, and others chase running rats down a hallway. Cal and Lovejoy exit the sitting room and detain a dark-haired steward in the hallway, who then hurries off. On the upper deck, a dark-haired man tosses a chunk of ice to a blond man, who tosses it back.\n\nSmith, Moody, Andrews, and Murdoch walk past Jack and Rose. The master-at-arms examines Jack's drawings, which Cal abruptly snatches away. Jack and Rose, holding hands, approach Lovejoy, who stands in the hallway. Lovejoy walks beside Jack and discreetly slips the heart of the ocean into Jack's coat pocket. Lovejoy then follows Rose and Jack into the sitting room, where Cal steps forward and exchanges a glance with Lovejoy, who responds with a raised eyebrow.",
    "719": "As the elevator ascends, Rose surveys her surroundings while wading through the water. She notices a sign above a doorway before proceeding down a short corridor and then turning into a longer hallway. Meanwhile, in an office, Jack, still handcuffed to a pipe, climbs onto a desk as the water level rises around him. Rose pauses at a staircase, then turns left and walks down another corridor, navigating through floating furniture. The lights in the hallway flicker intermittently.\n\nJack turns his attention toward the closed office door. Rose, after turning around, quickly approaches the same door and steps inside. Overwhelmed by relief and urgency, she kisses Jack. She then begins a frantic search through a cabinet filled with keys and pulls out a desk drawer, turning to Jack with a hopeful look; they share smiles amidst their dire situation. Despite her efforts, Rose finds nothing in the drawer. As the bow of the ship begins to sink, she scans the office, now feeling the pressure of time. She moves a desk chair out of her way to reach Jack again, kissing him before leaving the office.\n\nRose moves down a long, dimly lit corridor, the water now reaching her waist. She ascends to the D deck, running through the hallways until a mustached man approaches her but then quickly retreats. Left alone, she gazes down the now-empty corridor. As she takes a few steps forward, the lights suddenly go out, leaving her breathless and leaning against the wall for support. When the lights return, she stands up only to encounter a dark-haired steward who rounds the corner and grabs her. In a swift reaction, she punches him, causing him to stumble back and touch his bloody nose before he hurries away. Overwhelmed, Rose leans back against the wall, blinking and staring ahead.\n\nRegaining her resolve, Rose moves forward, unwraps a fire hose, and uses it to shatter the glass of a case, retrieving an axe. With the axe in hand, she runs toward the E deck stairs. On the ship's bridge, Captain Smith leans over the railing, observing the flooding bow and the front well deck. Meanwhile, Rose carefully descends the E deck stairs, stopping just above the water that has risen over several steps. She steps into the water, grabs an overhead frame, and ducks her head to peek into the hallway. She looks both ways down the flooded corridor before stepping back and hanging the axe on the frame. Removing her long sweater and letting it drop, she grabs the axe with one hand and wades into the water. Using a long pipe along the ceiling to propel herself forward, she navigates through the chest-deep water back into the office, the axe held high.\n\nInside the office, Rose holds out the axe toward Jack, who stretches the chain of his handcuffs along the water pipe. With determination, Rose lifts the axe and moves to a wooden cabinet. With a powerful swing, she strikes the cabinet door, attempting to free Jack from his restraints.",
    "723": "As the movie unfolds, Lovejoy, with a scowl on his face, follows Cal across the bridge. They brush past an officer as they move. Simultaneously, Ismay stands near a collapsible lifeboat, observing a crowd of passengers on the lower side of the bridge before turning his attention back to the collapsible. Seizing the moment as Murdoch turns away, Ismay discreetly takes a seat on the collapsible. Murdoch, upon facing the collapsible, finds himself locked in a gaze with his mate, who looks ahead. With a stern expression, Murdoch motions downward with both arms, signaling the seamen who then lower the collapsible. As it descends below the deck, Ismay looks up.\n\nElsewhere, Lightoller quickly lifts a young girl into a lifeboat. Rose turns to Jack, and Cal, observing the interaction, shifts his gaze between them. In a swift move, Cal yanks the blanket off Rose and thrusts it towards Jack, then gently drapes his own coat over Rose's shoulders. As Cal reaches to stroke Rose's hair, she recoils, stepping away. Jack moves closer to her side. A crewman then takes hold of Rose, guiding her towards the lifeboat, with Jack and another crew member assisting her into it. As Rose clings to Jack's outstretched hand, a crewman intervenes, pushing Jack back. The lifeboat jolts, beginning its descent towards the water, with Cal and Jack watching from the rail as Rose gazes back at Jack. Jack's eyes move from Cal to the lowering boat.\n\nRose, now in the lifeboat, looks around, her eyes trailing up to the ropes threading through the pulleys. She looks back at Jack, then to her right, where a young girl waves at her father while her sister cries. On the deck above, a crew member, arms raised and voice loud, shouts orders. Rose's gaze returns to Jack, who remains beside Cal. In the night sky above, a flare bursts and fades, momentarily lighting up Rose's face. More flares streak across the sky above Jack.\n\nSuddenly, Rose moves to the edge of the lifeboat and leaps out, clinging to the ship's rail several decks below where Jack stands. Two crew members quickly pull her back on board. Rose then dashes along the lower deck while Jack, after turning, sprints down the main deck, weaving past passengers and crew, then rushes inside to race down the grand staircase. At the base of the stairs, Rose rushes into Jack's arms, and they embrace, sharing a kiss that leads to another hug.\n\nFrom an upper landing, Cal watches them. Lovejoy approaches, grabbing Cal's shoulder and pulling him away from the railing. As they move, Cal swiftly grabs Lovejoy's gun and dashes towards the stairs, pulling Rose away from Jack. Rose and Jack flee, with Cal tearing down the stairs in pursuit.",
    "725": "In the gripping tale of a ship's final moments, a woman expertly swims across a water-filled corridor that almost touches the ceiling. Upon reaching the stairs, she pauses, turns around, and watches as a man joins her. Together, they climb the stairs to safety. Meanwhile, Tommy and Fabrizio, at the forefront of a surging crowd, leap over a barrier with agility. On the deck, crew members meticulously lift a lifeboat using long oars configured as a ramp.\n\nMurdoch, upon reaching the deck, rushes to a stairwell, his eyes fixed on the turbulent water below. Simultaneously, Cal dashes through a doorway, only to be knocked into the flow of a running crowd by a man. Cal recovers, joins the throng, but soon halts, then scales a nearby platform to survey the crowd. His gaze falls on a young girl crying; he briefly observes her before walking away. Inside the ship, Rose and Jack sprint up a staircase, desperate to reach safety. In another scene, one man plunges into the water, while another hangs perilously from a rope.\n\nCal reappears, approaching the scene just as Murdoch, with a quick motion, extracts money from his pocket and tosses it at Cal. In a swift reaction, Murdoch shoves Cal aside. Elsewhere, a man makes a daring leap towards a lifeboat, only to be met with a gunshot from Murdoch. Amidst the chaos, another man shoves Tommy forward, leading to Murdoch shooting Tommy. Fabrizio, grief-stricken, kneels beside his fallen friend.\n\nMurdoch, reflecting on his actions, steps back towards the ship's edge, glancing to his right and then at the crowd of passengers. Cal, filled with rage, glares at Murdoch. In a solemn moment, Murdoch stands at attention, salutes, then tragically turns the gun on himself, firing and falling into the ocean.\n\nCal, undeterred, rejoins the crowd. On the opposite side of the ship, crew members tip another lifeboat onto the deck below. Cal, spotting a crying girl, picks her up and moves towards the crowd of passengers. He quickens his pace, hands the girl to a woman, and then climbs into the lifeboat, settling down. The woman, in turn, hands the girl back to Cal.\n\nJack and Rose, still fighting for survival, dash towards the smoking room. Inside, Andrews stands near the fireplace, his eyes locked on a painting. He hands Rose his lifebelt, and she embraces him in gratitude before rushing through a revolving door. Jack, taking a moment to look back and nod, follows Rose.\n\nElsewhere, a steward, carrying two lifebelts, hurries towards the Grand Staircase. Outside, a sailor operates a winch as others assist in turning over the top of a lifeboat. Captain Smith observes this, then turns to see a man wading through shallow water on the deck. A woman holding a baby approaches the captain, who briefly stares at her before stepping away. Another man with a lifebelt runs up to the captain, who stops to glance at the lifebelt before walking off.\n\nKnee-deep in water, Captain Smith steps onto the bridge, his gaze lingering on the ship's wheel and various instruments before he enters the wheelhouse and closes the door. The ship's string quartet concludes their performance, with three members packing up their instruments and walking away as people rush past. However, Hartley, the violinist, presses his instrument against his neck and begins to play once more, offering a poignant soundtrack to the unfolding tragedy.",
    "727": "As the ship begins its tragic descent, passengers tumble onto the lower deck. Within the ship's interior, furniture like tables and chairs violently collide with people trying to swim to safety. Rising water forces some individuals upward along the staircase, while others find themselves trapped against the ceiling of the lower deck. At the top of the staircase, an intricately carved wall clock succumbs to the rising flood and disappears beneath the turbulent water.\n\nSeawater forcefully enters through the ship's openings, pushing passengers back inside the sinking vessel. Amidst the chaos, Fabrizio, equipped with a life vest, swims past a shattered window. He struggles against the suction that slams him against the ship's side but manages to brace himself on the window frame. Attempting to reach safety, he stretches for a railing but loses his grip and slips. Determined, he turns and swims towards open water. Meanwhile, Rose falls onto a lower deck and is helped up by the ship's baker.\n\nJack and Rose find each other again amidst the throng of people. In a nearby lifeboat, Cal aggressively fends off desperate passengers with an oar. The tension escalates as several cables holding a funnel break, causing it to whip wildly against the water. Cal watches in horror as the massive funnel begins to topple. In the water, Fabrizio, along with others, looks up just in time to see the funnel crash down upon him, generating a wave that sweeps away numerous people.\n\nIn another lifeboat, a man tries to climb aboard, but Cal cruelly pushes him back into the sea. Jack and Rose struggle through the dense crowd, slowly ascending another staircase. Inside the ship, passengers desperately cling to columns at the top of the grand staircase. A surge of water races down an empty corridor, demolishing furniture and ripping doors from their frames.\n\nBehind the Titanic, occupants of a lifeboat row with all their might as the ship's giant propellers emerge from the water. Desperate passengers jump from the back of the Titanic, which is now dramatically tilted several stories above the ocean surface. Jack, holding Rose's hand, leaps through the crowd to reach a railing where they witness others plunging into the sea below. They continue their journey, navigating past a group of people gathered around a priest.\n\nNear the propeller, dozens tread water for survival. Jack pulls Rose towards a deck now slanting at a forty-five-degree angle. They reach the exact spot where they first met and grasp the railing. The propellers continue to tilt upward as water cascades down them. Nearby, kneeling individuals hold onto a priest who grips a cab stand or rotating shaft.\n\nBeside Jack and Rose, a woman tightly embraces a young boy. Shivering, Rose clings to Jack, her breath visible in the cold air, as they gaze down at the sinking ship. A soft smile graces Rose's face. Jack envelops her in a tight embrace and gently kisses her forehead.\n\nIn a now submerged section of the ship, a woman's lifeless body floats under a large chandelier, her gauzy dress softly billowing in the water, marking the grim finality of the disaster.",
    "730": "As ice crystals glisten in Jack's hair, he tenderly grasps Rose's hand, planting a gentle kiss on its back. Smiling briefly, Jack winces and closes his eyes, while Rose, her eyes shut, rests her head against their entwined hands.\n\nMeanwhile, a lifeboat navigates back to the wreckage site, its dark-haired crewman sweeping a flashlight across the debris-littered water. The beam reveals frozen bodies scattered among furniture, barrels, and other remnants of the disaster. The crewman uses an oar to probe several of these stiff corpses, while another sailor, leaning over the boat's bow, pushes bodies aside to clear their slow path forward. The flashlight illuminates the tragic sight of a dead woman and infant floating amidst the wreckage.\n\nElsewhere in the debris field, Rose lies on a floating wooden panel, singing softly to herself under the starry night sky. Jack, his head and arms kept above water beside her, remains motionless, his eyes closed. As ice encrusts her hair and eyebrows, Rose turns her head, a distant light casting a glow on her face. A lifeboat passes by a few yards away, unnoticed by her. She shakes Jack's hand, then rubs his arm and sits up, her smile fading as she realizes he is unresponsive. Desperately, she shakes him harder, glancing toward the departing lifeboat. Between them, a dead crewman floats, a whistle still in his mouth. As tears trickle down her nose, Rose, her brow furrowed, chokes back sobs while stroking Jack's hand.\n\nThe lifeboat rows further away, and Rose trembles watching it recede. She lies back down and closes her eyes, the rescuers' flashlight beams dimming in the distance. Suddenly, her eyes snap open, and she sits up, prying her hand from Jack's grip. She kisses his hand and releases him, watching as he sinks into the icy depths and disappears. Sliding to the edge of her platform and rolling into the water, Rose's breath forms clouds in the cold air. She swims to the frozen crewman, retrieves the whistle from his lips, and starts blowing it, attracting the rescuers' lights to her position.\n\nYears later, on a research ship, an elderly Rose opens her eyes, tears streaming down the face of her companion, Lizzy. As dawn breaks over the ocean, Ismay sits silently in a lifeboat among other survivors. In another boat, a man drinks from a flask and passes it to Cal. Elsewhere, Ruth huddles against Molly, who steers out to sea, her expression blank. Wrapped in a blanket, her face pale and dazed by the green light of dawn, Ruth looks up, lost in thought.",
    "733": "The movie opens with Jack joyfully kissing the tickets and embracing Fabrizio, while Olaf throttles Sven. Fabrizio swiftly gathers the winnings into Jack's cap. Soon after, the two young men dash along the dock and sprint up the gangplank, entering the ship with sacks over their shoulders. They race onto an upper deck, waving enthusiastically from a railing towards arm lockers.\n\nAs they settle in, black smoke erupts from one of the Titanic's four stacks. The ship pulls away from the shore, propelled by tugboats, as hundreds of passengers wave to the crowd on the dock. Amidst this, a bearded man cranks a movie camera on the dock, stirring up clouds of silt as the Titanic glides forward. The vastness of the ship is highlighted by white seagulls, appearing as mere insects, fluttering past the massive crowd on board. The ocean liner, with its four rows of portholes, sails past a small two-manned sailboat.\n\nInside the Titanic, a brown-haired woman guides a young boy and girl up a corridor. Jack and Fabrizio pass by in the opposite direction. Jack then enters a berth where his roommates exchange puzzled glances. Meanwhile, in her cabin, Rose carefully unpacks a painting. A porter brings in a pair of suitcases just as Cal enters from the adjoining promenade deck. Another porter wheels in a safe on a dolly, and Cal forcefully shoves a bottle of champagne into an ice bucket.\n\nAs the Titanic cruises through open water, the white-bearded captain joins the first officer on deck. Murdoch confidently strides into the wheelhouse, where Moody pulls a telegraph lever to full speed; a corresponding needle on an identical machine in the engine room moves to match. Men dash along catwalks as large gears drive huge pistons up and down. In the smoky boiler room, covered in coal, the mustached foreman turns a wheel connected to several steam pipes. A needle on a steam pressure gauge rises, and the pistons accelerate, slicing through the ocean.\n\nOn deck, Jack and Fabrizio lean against the railing, captivated by the sea. Behind them, Captain Smith stands on the uppermost deck outside the pilot hub, joined by First Officer Murdoch. The captain glances at him and grins. Jack points excitedly at something below—a dolphin swimming ahead of the ship. More dolphins join it, zooming through the clear water like zigzagging torpedoes. One dolphin leaps gracefully out of the water. Jack smiles, enchanted by the sight, as a crew member hands a teacup to Captain Smith. The captain sips his drink, gazing out to sea.\n\nBack in the boiler room, men dump wheelbarrows of coal beside stokers who shovel the fuel into the large furnaces. An engineer leans over a railing, observing the massive pistons pumping vigorously on either side.",
    "734": "Jack balances on the ship's prow, gripping a cable. He stretches his arms high above his head, then leans back, closing his eyes as the vast ship cuts through the ocean waves. Meanwhile, Ruth, Rose, and Cal dine with guests, including Molly Brown and a mustached, brown-haired man. Tension rises as Rose lights a cigarette, prompting Ruth to stiffen. Rose defiantly blows smoke towards her mother, only for Cal to quickly grab and extinguish the cigarette. Rose smiles faintly at Cal before rising and exiting the table.\n\nElsewhere, a brunette girl stands on a railing, secured by her father's grip from behind. Nearby, Jack, a few feet away, captures the scene with charcoal sketches. Crewmen stroll by, leading dogs on leashes. The brown-haired Irishman offers a handshake to Jack, who then surveys the ship around him. On an upper deck, Rose positions herself behind Tommy at the railing. Tommy turns, spots her, and exchanges a grin with Jack, who stares up at Rose. She briefly meets his gaze before looking away, then peeks at him again from the corner of her eye. Fabrizio waves his hand in front of Jack's face to get his attention.\n\nCal approaches Rose from behind, seizing her arm; they exchange heated words before Rose strides away, with Cal rolling his eyes and following her. Dressed in a striking ruby-colored evening gown, Rose forcefully moves past other passengers as she rushes down a deck, opens a gate, and dashes along the lower deck towards the ship's rear. Meanwhile, Jack lounges on a bench, smoking and gazing at the starry sky. He sits up as Rose dashes by him.\n\nTears streaming down her cheeks, Rose reaches the poop deck at the ship's rear. She looks back over her shoulder and then down at the turbulent water below. She grips the railing, climbs onto the first rung, and then, holding onto a flag pole, swings her legs over the railing, lowering herself onto a gun wheel. Facing the water, with the wind tossing her curly, auburn hair around her face, she leans forward over the ocean. Jack quietly approaches her from behind, takes a final puff of his cigarette, and discards it over the ship's side. He pockets his hands, turns to Rose, removes his coat, unlaces his boots, and pulls them off. As Rose gazes between the water and Jack, he removes his vest and extends his hand to her. Rose takes it, turning on the narrow ledge to face him directly, looking into his eyes as he smiles at her. Suddenly, she steps on her dress's hem, causing her to slip.",
    "741": "In her recollection, she envisions Constantine tenderly braiding Skeeter's hair as a young girl on the front steps. A smile graces her face as she recalls this memory. On a dreary street corner, Miss Stein arranges two stacks of slender hardbacks with light blue covers in a bookshop's window display. Minnie, while frying chicken, opens an envelope containing money. She quickly tucks the envelope into her dress's front and dashes out, leaving the chicken to burn.\n\nAt a retirement home, Mrs. Walters reads aloud from the book to some residents, turning the page with a glib smile. Later, she converses with her daughter over the phone. Aibileen and Minnie navigate their shopping carts through a supermarket. Aibileen courteously steps aside for a white woman to pass. As they reach the end of an aisle, Aibileen's eyes widen in alarm, and she quickly steps back. Minnie also notices and presses herself against the aisle. Both brace themselves to move past, but the robust woman remains deeply engrossed.\n\nAt Skeeter's residence, Stuart storms out onto the porch with a thunderous expression, then abruptly turns and strides towards his Jeep, leaving Skeeter visibly puzzled and teary-eyed. Skeeter takes two copies of the book. At home, Charlotte, seated upright in bed beside her slumbering husband, reads the book. She sinks into her pillow and removes her glasses, a look of horror on her face. Elizabeth, in a rocking chair, reads the book while bottle-feeding her baby. Yule Mae reads it aloud to fellow inmates. Hilly reads it in bed. Later, she sorts through her mail, opens an envelope to find a note and a check from Celia Foote. With a smirk, Hilly tears the check into tiny pieces and storms out of the house.\n\nDriving a Ford Fairlane station wagon down a straight dirt road between lush green fields, Hilly kicks up clouds of dust. Her lips curl as she drinks beer, spilling some on her blouse and swerving the car. She finishes the beer and lights a cigarette, tossing the empty bottle into the backseat. Skeeter receives a letter from Elain Stein offering her a job as a junior editor at Harper & Row Publishers. Hilly, enveloped in a storm of dust, arrives in front of Skeeter's house and marches to the front door with the determination of an angry chicken. She throws a pebble at Skeeter, who suffers from a cold sore. Charlotte, looking elegant in a tightly fitting turban, smiles loftily at Hilly, barely managing to keep a straight face with Skeeter. Charlotte reaches for Skeeter's hand, and they enter the spacious hall with its parquet floor. Charlotte suddenly appears very fatigued.",
    "739": "In the tranquil night, a crescent moon, partially obscured by clouds, is mirrored in the serene water. A fisherman's float disrupts the stillness as it lands on the surface, creating concentric rings. Perched on the moon's curve, a boy casually lounges, his fishing rod in hand.\n\nThe scene shifts to a somber-looking black woman in her 40s who turns to face the camera. She sets aside a cooking pot and, with a smile and a long, penetrating gaze, nods. However, her smile quickly fades. Her eyes sweep the room and rest on a framed photo on the opposite wall, capturing the image of a young black graduate student. After a moment, she looks away.\n\nWith gentle care, she lifts a baby from her cot and wraps her arms around the little girl. Dressed in a wig and a pale, blue and white uniform, she heads to the bus stop, patting the child's tummy. The hem of her uniform appears uneven.\n\nThe camera then focuses on a young redhead driving a 1962 blue convertible Cadillac along a dirt track that cuts through a broad field, leaving clouds of dust in her wake. Ring lettered Skeeter, at the wheel, wears a look of determined optimism. She stops at a gas station, where a black attendant cleans her windshield. Nearby, a flag flutters atop the substantial offices of the Jackson Journal. Skeeter parks outside the main entrance and strides confidently through the glass fronted door. A cigarette-smoking receptionist guides her through the sprawling open-plan office to the editor's office, where a short, middle-aged man, seemingly overwhelmed by his large desk, points at Skeeter. Eugenia Phelan, known as Skeeter, hands over her resume. The editor reaches for a folder. Later, Skeeter, clutching a basket of readers' letters, exits Blackly's office with a happy smile.\n\nAt her home, a well-groomed brunette in a flowery, sleeveless '60s-style dress marks dots on a length of toilet paper. Minnie, a stout, well-cushioned maid, hurries to the foot of the stairs and calls upward. Carrying a pie, she follows the ladies to their car.\n\nAibileen Clark, the narrator, is seen garnishing a dish with grapes. Elizabeth Leefolt peeks through her front curtains and nods to Aibileen, who carefully slides a chicken dish over a crack in the dining table's veneer. In the bathroom, Elizabeth squats in front of moon-faced Mae Mobley, who sits on a child's toilet seat, before scooping her daughter up.\n\nHilly enters the sitting room with a sashay and beams at her girlfriends. In the kitchen, Minnie joins Aibileen and heads straight for a dish of deviled eggs, biting into one. She then picks up a tray and a TV set, carrying them towards the lounge. Aibileen tidies up by picking up the cord that Minnie trails behind her.",
    "747": "In the morning, Aibileen prepares a hearty breakfast in her kitchen. Meanwhile, Minnie sips her tea, enjoying the quiet moment. Over at her house, Skeeter's excitement is palpable as she suddenly looks up. Her mother, Charlotte, calls out loudly from the bottom of the stairs. Skeeter, still in her pajamas, rushes out of her room, nearly losing her footing on the stairs in her haste. She swings open the kitchen's fly screen door, her eyes scanning the room with anticipation. Her hair is set in rollers, and later, she examines her smooth hair with a contemplative gaze. Charlotte watches from the doorway as Skeeter drives away in a pickup truck, towing a trailer filled with belongings, heading towards a leafy suburb over a bridge.\n\nAt the Holbrooks', Hilly glances impatiently at her watch. Skeeter arrives, her appearance somewhat unkempt. William and Stuart stand up to greet her. The men take humorous swigs of their Coke. During dinner, Stuart, sharply dressed and ambitious, quickly drinks his bourbon and commands a waiter's attention with a pointed finger. His expression shifts to one of confusion. Hilly subtly steers her husband away from the table, leaving Skeeter alone with Stuart. Stuart lets out a burp, prompting Skeeter to roll her eyes in annoyance. She abruptly leaves the table, her exit amusing the bourbon-drinking Stuart, who tipsily winks at William, who responds with a despairing shake of his head.\n\nIn her yard, Celia approaches a log with a lively chicken, ready to use the waiting ax. Minnie, watching from a window, flinches at the scene. Nearby, a tin of Crisco lard sits on a shelf. Celia offers a warm smile. Minnie carefully folds the top of a brown paper bag and passes it to Celia. Later, Minnie takes a seat at an attractively set table by the kitchen window for lunch. She places a napkin on her lap and lifts a fried chicken wing to her mouth. Across from her, Celia's face shows determination, causing Minnie to pause and then sit back down. Celia bites into a chicken leg, a contented smile spreading across her face. Minnie casts a knowing look her way.\n\nIn Aibileen's dimly lit house, she and Minnie listen intently to a phone conversation. Aibileen gently pushes Minnie's hand away, her face contorting with pain as memories resurface. She stands up and exits the room, leaving Minnie behind.\n\nAt the Holbrook swimming pool, Hilly speaks to the local ladies with authority. Elizabeth responds with a simpering smile. Elain notices a pamphlet sticking out of Skeeter's briefcase. Dramatically, she shields her eyes from the sun, waiting for Aibileen's response. Aibileen's eyes meet Yule Mae's across the space. Later, Skeeter enters the Holbrooks' kitchen and discovers Yule Mae at the sink. Yule Mae cautiously checks that no one is nearby. Hilly enters, carrying her young son Billy. She kisses him on the head before handing him to Yule Mae. Hilly's expression hardens, and with a sneer, she menacingly points her finger.\n\nAfter dark, Skeeter works diligently in her room, smoking a cigarette as she ponders over Hilly's written words. Her gaze drifts to a shelf where a photograph of her younger self with Hilly sits, evoking a bitter memory.",
    "748": "In the opening scene, she extinguishes her cigarette and removes a photo from a frame that seemed to evoke guilt, setting it aside. With a defiant tilt of her chin, she then conceals the black and white photo in a drawer. The next morning, she lies asleep, still dressed, on her bed when Charlotte, wearing a skull cap and dressing gown, bursts into the room and begins rifling through the wardrobe, pulling out clothes.\n\nLater, on the porch, Charlotte, elegantly attired, attempts to listen in on a conversation between Stuart and Skeeter while she tends to her plants. Stuart then walks away, prompting Skeeter to glance back at the house with a speculative frown. She confidently strides past her smiling date.\n\nInside a bustling diner, he, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, has ordered oysters. They celebrate by clinking their oysters and crackers together. He reaches across the table to take her hand, and she responds with a smile. Outside the diner, Stuart takes her hand again, steps closer, and kisses her on the lips.\n\nIn a different scene, Mae Mobley sits on Aibileen's knee, engaged with a picture book. Hilly emerges from her house with a grimace, aggressively pushing past a press photographer. Her yard is littered with toilets, amidst which she retrieves her Yard of the Month sign, cradling it as she carries it inside, much to the amusement of onlookers. Mae Mobley, with her knickers down, proudly occupies one of the scattered toilets on the lawn. Elizabeth hastily removes her daughter from the scene. Aibileen, tenderly holding Mae Mobley, sets her down amidst about a dozen toilets on the lawn, kneels in front of her, grasps her hands, and gazes intently into her moonlit face. They embrace warmly. Elizabeth, observing coldly from the front door, retreats inside.\n\nAt the Phelans', Skeeter, along with Josefo and Pascagoula, watches civil rights activist Medgar Evers on TV until Charlotte abruptly turns it off. The servants quickly disperse. Charlotte then takes Skeeter's hand, but Skeeter pulls away and leaves.\n\nOn her bus ride home, Aibileen naps. Nearby, Henry looks up from his book. The bus halts, and the driver activates the interior lights to address the passengers. Aibileen and Henry, previously seated at the back, rush off the bus and walk down the dark street. Henry departs, and upon seeing him vanish around the corner, Aibileen breaks into a run. She trips and falls during her sprint. Civil rights activist Roy Wilkins provides commentary on the events.\n\nElsewhere, Minnie's children exit the kitchen, the three younger ones crowding into a single bed. The two friends comfort each other with a shared embrace. Skeeter, with a somber expression, flips through a LIFE magazine, pausing at the front cover depicting a distraught widow comforting her young son.\n\nAt the foot mansion, Minnie is vacuuming around a stuffed standing grizzly bear positioned on a corner dice. She gazes towards the fad, steps off the platform, and walks through the spacious rooms, directly heading to the bedroom and then to the bathroom door.",
    "749": "In the film, a woman calmly steps away from a door. She then bursts into a bathroom to discover Celia sitting amidst a pool of blood. Reacting quickly, she picks up a fallen towel rack and assesses the scene with a composed demeanor. She then covers Celia, who is lying in bed, with a counterpane and applies a wet cloth to her neck. As she does this, her encouraging expression fades. Celia, lying in the bed, her face contorts into a tearful grimace.\n\nLater, in her garden, Celia has dug a hole in the lawn. She positions a small cardboard box in the hole and begins to fill it with earth. Nearby, two rose bushes stand in their own brick-lined flower beds. As she nearly fills the hole, she reaches for a third rose bush and places it into the makeshift planter.\n\nThe scene shifts to a street where a yellow and green bus opens its doors, and a group of maids disembarks. Among the last to leave the bus are Yule Mae and Aibileen. A police officer handcuffs Yule Mae, and as she is led away, Aibileen is pushed back against the side of the bus. Yule Mae's face is forcefully pressed down onto the hood of a police car, and one of the officers issues her a warning. Aibileen observes white mothers and their children being turned away with cold indifference. Meanwhile, Hilly sits in her car with her son, her expression impassive.\n\nAt a diner, Skeeter sits at the counter as Hilly enters and seats her son in one of the booths. Henry, who is behind the counter, leans in close to Skeeter, his wise, dark eyes peering at her through his owl-like glasses. Skeeter then hurries over to Aibileen's house, finding the living room filled with maids, their somber, smooth-skinned faces turning to look at her. Aibileen beckons her forward, and with tears welling up in her eyes, Skeeter steps into the center of the room. An elderly white-haired woman begins to share her story.\n\nElsewhere, Miss Tine, dining in a swanky restaurant with two male colleagues, speaks to Skeeter on the phone. An orange cruiser arrives at Elizabeth's drive where a bridge game is in full swing. Mary Beth takes Skeeter's seat at Hilly's table.\n\nCelia, dressed in a low-cut fitted plum top and a tight pink skirt, approaches the garden path with a pie in hand. Inside, Elizabeth glances toward the door, while Hilly's jaw drops in surprise. Hilly quickly takes control and ducks out of sight. At the front of the house, Celia spots a gap in the curtains and offers a cheery smile, which Hilly notices. Celia's smile fades, and she retreats with her pie. Aibileen watches Celia's humiliation from the kitchen doorway. On her way back to her car, Celia struggles to hold back tears. Once home, Minnie looks at her with the compassion of a mother consoling a child who has been bullied.",
    "750": "At the beginning, Minnie, sporting a cut above her eye, sighs and sits on a chair provided by Celia. Celia then gently uses a cloth to dab at the cut while Minnie quietly listens to her advice. Meanwhile, at the Phelan's, the household gathers around their black and white television, engrossed in a broadcast by Walter Cronkite. In another scene, Stuart tenderly kisses Skeeter on the forehead, both dressed in black. Skeeter, with tears in her eyes, turns her attention back to the TV.\n\nA color photograph of John F. Kennedy is displayed alongside a photo of Aibileen's son. Minnie's gaze shifts, leading to a flashback of her visit to Hilly's home. There, Hilly, seated at a polished mahogany dining table, savors a forkful of Minnie's pie with delight. Minnie watches, her expression one of satisfied amusement, as Hilly takes another bite. The scene escalates when Mrs. Walters enters with an empty glass, pours herself a whiskey, and then bursts into giggles at the unfolding drama. Hilly, after shoving the plate back at Minnie and dismissing her, continues eating. Minnie forcefully places the plate down and fixes Hilly with a barely-disguised amused look, her eyes darting towards the chocolate-colored pie. As Hilly takes her final bite, she rises, squares her shoulders, and then retches. Minnie, seizing the remaining pie, flees the scene.\n\nSkeeter, witnessing this, shakes her head in disbelief. Minnie, now wrapping her cardigan tightly around herself, storms out. Later, a \"whites only\" Jackson City cab drops Mrs. Walters off at the Junior League benefit dinner. Mrs. Walters joins other elegantly dressed attendees ascending the steps to the beautifully lit venue. The Footes arrive, linked arm-in-arm, and quickly grab champagne from a waiter's tray. Meanwhile, Sugar, Minnie, and Aibileen serve in their black uniforms with white collars and aprons. Minnie discreetly nudges Aibileen to observe Celia's body-hugging pink dress as Celia finishes her drink and waves at Hilly, whose automatic smile stiffens before she slaps her husband for staring.\n\nOn the dance floor, Charlotte and her husband dance on the black and white checkered tiles, while Skeeter and Stuart dance closely nearby. Celia, by the buffet, scribbles something down while sipping another glass of champagne. The atmosphere lightens when Mr. Blackly entertains with a jig and cartwheel, prompting the maids to laugh heartily. Celia, slightly unsteady, makes her way to the powder room, where she leans to reapply her lipstick, inadvertently turning her perfectly formed behind towards a group of women—Elizabeth, Jolene, and Mary Beth—who stand in a confrontational stance by the mantle piece.\n\nBack in the ballroom, Hilly takes the microphone and gestures towards the staff lined up, causing Skeeter's expression to harden.",
    "752": "A high door swings open, revealing a caped figure standing at the entrance of a warehouse. He surveys the surroundings, where silver-grey light from numerous small windows illuminates an array of peculiar objects. To his left, past a set of stairs, two large shapes emerge, gradually recognizable as the ends of two train carriages, each slightly bent and twisted. He approaches the less damaged one, examining it from the back. Upon looking up along its length, he notices the sides are severely smashed open, with the remaining glass cracked and shattered. Inside, seats are askew, torn from their mountings with their upholstery charred and blackened. The man's face is illuminated by the light as he gazes at the wrecked carriage, standing motionless and grim-faced for a long time, seemingly oblivious to the drops of water falling from his hood.\n\nIn another scene, set in the dark, a man is crouching. He rises to his knees, and as his head lifts, light reveals the face of David, who appears to be about 20 years old. He scans his surroundings, noticing the light emanating from a burning car flipped over behind him. David staggers toward the vehicle, stumbling and crawling on his knees. Inside the burning wreckage, a young woman, Audrey, lies unconscious and still. David grabs the car door with both hands and pulls, then checks the door catch, which remains unmoved. Audrey's arm dangles out of the window. David grips the door edge again and heaves with all his strength. As flames leap into the night sky behind him, he manages to rip the door off its hinges. He bends down to release Audrey's seat belt, then drags her from the car, cradles her in his arms, and gently lays her down a short distance away. Glancing over his shoulder, David spots the lights of a pickup truck slowly rounding a bend. He waves frantically to catch the driver's attention. Turning back, he sees Audrey's eyes are now open. Tenderly, he holds her head as the truck driver rushes over to them. David looks into the concerned face of the driver, then back at Audrey. Very slowly, he lifts his head, the flames still flickering behind him, his expression thoughtful and avoiding the man's eyes.\n\nIn a different setting, Elijah rolls his wheelchair along a darkened corridor, his right leg extended straight out with two rows of shiny bolts protruding from the metal frame around it. He reaches for the phone. As he looks straight ahead, past rows of shelving showcasing a vast collection of comics, David is seen standing at the top of the stairs overlooking the concourse of Philadelphia Train Station, flanked by tall classical stone pillars on either side.",
    "753": "In the vast expanse of the station, the luminous disk of the clock dominates the view. High above, cold silver beams from ceiling lamps illuminate the concourse, where people hurriedly cross paths. David, blending into the grey surroundings, descends a stone staircase. At its base, dressed in a baseball cap and rain cape, he observes the crowd's fluid motion.\n\nHe begins to stroll leisurely through the throng when a young blonde woman in a vibrant red jacket collides with him. From an elevated vantage point, David later spots her again, now adorned in a different, gleaming jacket, inside a jewelry store. She gestures towards an elderly assistant, and as his attention diverts, she stealthily reaches over the counter, grabs a bracelet, and slips it into her bag. David watches as she merges back into the crowd, and he continues his slow journey.\n\nAs he moves, others occasionally brush against him. Mid-concourse, he pauses, surrounded by a whirl of people, and subtly extends his left hand with fingers spread. A man in a checked shirt, his shirt untucked, bumps into David’s outstretched hand.\n\nFrom above once more, David observes this same man in a checked shirt, leaning out of a pickup truck, brutally smashing a bottle over a black woman's head as she walks a city street at night. Back in the station, David, his brow furrowed, watches the man finish a beer and discard the can.\n\nElsewhere, a young man in a green shirt kneels beside a bed where a young woman in a very short party dress lies motionless. She rolls, unaware, exposing her thighs, and as the boy watches briefly before standing, her leg slides off the bed. She remains still, her blonde hair scattered over a pile of coats, as the boy exits and gently closes the door.\n\nDavid shifts his focus, scanning the station. A procession of college students wearing maroon baseball caps passes him. Beyond them, he sees the young man now in a green jacket hugging his mother and beaming at his father. Emotionally stirred, David starts to walk backwards, swallowing hard and observing others as they move past. He inadvertently backs into a maintenance man in orange overalls, who is maneuvering a wheeled trash bin.\n\nThis same maintenance man, now in an orange T-shirt, stands before a house's front door, which another man opens. They lock eyes through the screen door. The maintenance man forcefully grabs and holds the door open. In a sudden vision, David sees the homeowner lying motionless on the basement stairs. Shocked, David lifts his gaze to the ceiling momentarily, his eyes wide. Still reeling from the shock, he surveys the concourse and spots the maintenance man emptying a trash can on the opposite side.",
    "754": "David trails a man maneuvering a wheelie bin around a corner and down a corridor dimly illuminated by sparse lighting. As he proceeds, a few individuals slump lazily against a wall, seemingly indifferent to their surroundings. David pauses before a door, his gaze fixed on the shadows of people moving behind its frosted glass panels.\n\nSuddenly, the door swings open, revealing the maintenance man once again, now donned in a cap and with a bag draped across his shoulder. The man continues his journey at a brisk pace along a street shrouded in darkness, flanked by parked cars, and ascends a long stairway illuminated sporadically by towering lamps. David, his hood drawn tightly against the relentless rain, shadows him.\n\nAt the summit of the stairs, David halts, observing as the man advances up a gently sloping street bordered by expansive homes set back from the road. The man turns onto a path leading to a detached house, fronted by a mature tree. He pauses under the porch, scans the street cautiously, retrieves an item from beside the porch, and then vanishes into the shadows beside the house.\n\nDavid, overcome by a moment of desolation, lowers his head, his face barely visible beneath the shadow of his hood, save for a small triangle from his nose to his mouth. He then lifts his gaze toward the house just as two thin beams of light gradually widen with the opening of a door. The expanding light reveals mail strewn across a tiled floor and clothing scattered further inside. Water drips from David’s cape onto a pair of shoes as he stands silhouetted in the doorway, the interior of the house illuminated.\n\nFrom his position, David can see beyond three open doorways to a staircase. He lingers in the doorway, then slowly turns back, stepping into a dimly lit lobby. Glancing to his left, he reaches out to open another door, flicks on a light, and surveys the room. The house owner lies face down on the basement steps, and David is struck again by the memory of the maintenance man's forceful entry into the house.\n\nDavid closes the door and cautiously moves into the next room, featuring half-paneled walls, passing a chair at the end of a table, indicating it's the dining room. He then enters another room with easy chairs, marking it as the sitting room, where the flicker of a television catches his eye and he pauses briefly.\n\nDavid hesitates before proceeding into the hallway. His shadow looms larger on the wall as he ascends the stairs. He peeks through the gap of a partly open door, frowning. With a step forward, he pushes the door wider and switches on the light, entering a child's bedroom adorned with pop posters on the walls.",
    "761": "In a quiet moment, a man opens the door to his walk-in wardrobe, illuminating the space with a bare bulb. He reaches up to a shelf, feeling under some folded jeans, and pulls out a piece of gray cloth from which the butt of a gun protrudes. Carefully, he lays the cloth on his newspaper, unwraps a stubby, black revolver, examines it briefly, then re-wraps and returns it to its hiding place. Again, he feels under the jeans, this time extracting a battered folder. Inside, he discovers old newspaper clippings about American football. Among the articles, a photo of a young David, decked out in football gear, catches his eye. As he turns the pages, more clippings and photos of football matches emerge, the players' identities obscured by helmets and face guards. His search pauses on a stark image of an overturned car, photographed at night on a tree-lined road, upside down in a ditch with its roof crushed. Frowning, he studies this photo intently before quickly closing the folder and concealing it once more under the jeans. Just then, he notices Audrey outside his door, her face crumpling as she pushes her fists to her mouth. He watches her descend the stairs before he quietly closes the door.\n\nLater, at a vast football stadium, David, now on duty, communicates with his walkie-talkie under the white canopy of a walkway. He and Elijah stroll near the crowds waiting to enter. As they move, David brushes past a tall, slim man in a pale, sandy green and gray camouflage jacket. A few steps later, David looks back, eyes narrowed. Elijah, wearing a long black leather coat and black gloves, supported by his stick, also glances back as they continue. At the head of the queue, David speaks to another security guard who begins frisking the fans. They watch a man with thinning hair and a black beard, who seems to scan his surroundings. This suspect eventually steps out of the line at a break in the metal barriers, hand covering his mouth, and walks away against the flow of fans. David exchanges a look with Elijah, grinning and nodding before raising his walkie-talkie.\n\nDavid then proceeds alone down a dark corridor. Meanwhile, Elijah's glass walking stick taps down onto the seat of his car as a man in a camouflage jacket walks by. Elijah hobbles through the arched colonnade surrounding the stadium, moving through patches of light and shadow, but the man ahead moves swiftly enough to disappear around the curve of the building.",
    "762": "In the bustling city, Elijah anxiously scans his surroundings and spots a man across the road near a dark brick stadium. The man briskly makes his way into the subway. Elijah, impatient and nervous, waits for a passing car before jaywalking against the traffic signals. His coat's skirt flaps open, displaying a vibrant purple lining as he almost skips across the street, driven by his anxious state.\n\nUpon reaching the other side, Elijah grabs the handrail to steady himself. Silhouetted against the daylight, he peers down the long, steep staircase into the tiled station, watching the man stride confidently below. As the man disappears into the station, Elijah, with a determined look, launches himself down the stairs. Using his stick and gripping the rail tightly, he struggles to maintain his balance, but his feet falter. He slips, his glass stick flying down the stairs ahead of him. Elijah finds himself sprawled on the stairs, lying on his back with his head pointing downward. From this upside-down perspective, he sees the man glance back just before vaulting over the ticket barrier. As the man's jacket flips up, Elijah catches a glimpse of a silver gun with a black grip tucked underneath. Overwhelmed, Elijah's eyes flicker and close.\n\nThe scene shifts to a sunny afternoon where a white bus stops on a hill in a suburban street. David, still clad in his security uniform of a green jacket and maroon cap, steps off the bus, carrying a holdall. With a smile on his face, he walks slowly towards a small green park where a group of boys are energetically playing American football on the grass. Joseph excitedly runs up some steps to join his father. Meanwhile, the other children gather around a young man with a crew cut, admiring his muscles. Together, David and Joseph turn and walk away, with Joseph's hand resting affectionately on his father's back.\n\nLater, in the dim light of a basement, David, now wearing a light grey sweatshirt, lies flat on a narrow bench, pushing up a weight's bar. He straightens his arms, carefully lowering the bar onto supports on either side of the bench, and then sits up. Joseph, his fringe hanging down to his eyebrows, watches his father intently. David looks around at the weights on the ends of the bar, then walks behind Joseph to the weights. Sitting back on the bench, David looks down as Joseph moves from one end of the bar to the other. David lies back, grips the bar, lifts it off the supports with a frown, and lowers it to his chest. As he begins to push it up, his mouth contorts with effort and a prominent vein bulges from his forehead up into his scalp. His arms quiver and his head trembles with the strain as he lowers the bar to his chest and pushes it back up. Reaching full arm extension, he drops the bar back onto the supports, his effort palpable in the quiet basement.",
    "764": "David slowly turns and watches her depart. Meanwhile, Elijah continues his conversation with Audrey. At the stadium, David stands still in the middle of the walkway, turning slowly with a frown, barely noticing the surrounding crowds. A young man wearing a vibrant blue anorak accidentally bumps into him.\n\nIn the restroom, another young man, dressed in a red and blue anorak draped over his shoulders, washes his hands at the sink. He glances towards the door, confirming he's alone, then reaches into a waist bin, retrieves a small package, and tucks it into his trouser pocket. Adjusting his anorak, he exits the restroom at a leisurely pace.\n\nBack in the stadium walkway, David observes as the man in the bright blue anorak joins a queue for tickets. Approaching him, David receives a weary look from the man, who slowly turns to face him. The man raises his arms, allowing David to pat down his clothes and search one of the anorak's pockets, though he finds nothing. After stepping back, David nods and swallows, watching as the man turns away. With a sigh, David moves in the opposite direction, pulling out his walkie-talkie. He frowns and glances back at the man in the anorak, who quickly averts his gaze.\n\nIn another scene, David sits across from a white-haired woman at a table, under the watchful eyes of Joseph. Nearby, a boy sits with a thermometer in his mouth. Joseph nods and gives a pitying look to another boy. David, repeatedly shaking his head, keeps his gaze fixed on the woman, staring intently.\n\nOutside, David and Joseph navigate through a playground, moving over the colorful hopscotch markings. Joseph shakes his head again as dusk begins to settle over the street near their home.\n\nInside the kitchen, David is at the sink washing dishes. He pauses, setting down a pan, and stares at Joseph, who is seated at a table with David's gun lying in front of him. Joseph picks up the gun, gripping it with both hands and pointing it at David. The gun then falls onto the table. David quickly grabs it, removes the bullets, while Audrey, overwhelmed, collapses onto the table with her head in her hands. David forcefully places the now-empty gun on the cooker, slides down the wall, and sits slumped against it. Audrey, unable to bear the tension, collapses onto the floor.\n\nIn a limited edition gallery, David stares at the carpet in a room decorated in shades of silver and grey. Outside, the street and shop lights pierce the grey evening as people wait to cross a busy junction. Inside a shop, Elijah sits motionless in his wheelchair, his face glowering and sullen, surrounded by walls lined with comics encased in reflective plastic covers.",
    "765": "In a dimly lit shop, a stock keeper with thick, curly hair, dressed in black jeans and a Motorhead T-shirt, glances up from behind his counter. He notices Elijah and after stowing an item away, he steps out and starts walking down the aisle toward him. Halfway, he pauses. Nearby, Joseph is engrossed in play with a caped superhero and a green reptilian villain toy. Audrey, standing with David, who has been leaning against the wall behind their son, watches Joseph. David shifts, unfolding his arms and sliding his hands into his pockets, then looks at Audrey.\n\nThe shop assistant's gaze shifts down to Elijah, his head swaying as he seeks a response. Eventually, he moves to the back of Elijah's wheelchair, grips the handles, and begins to push him down the aisle, carefully navigating around the crammed shelves and displays. Abruptly, Elijah jerks a wheel, causing the chair to veer into a display, scattering magazines across the floor. The assistant, hands moving weakly, looks at Elijah as if about to say something, but Elijah, slumped and unresponsive, pays him no heed. The assistant tries again to push the wheelchair, but Elijah jerks the other wheel. The assistant steps back, raising his hands in a gesture of surrender, and looks down at the sullen-faced Elijah before they continue on between the racks of comics and toys. The assistant eventually leaves Elijah at the display he had collided with. Elijah, wearing a padded black mitten, picks up a comic from the wreckage. The cover features a muscular hero in blue charging at shadowy demonic figures. He holds it out toward the assistant, who is now back at the counter, engaged in a telephone conversation.\n\nMeanwhile, David and Audrey sit at a bar, facing each other in a quiet, intense gaze. A babysitter arrives, and David hands her some money. As she prepares to leave, she notices the heavy rain outside, hastily covering her hair with a small brown jacket before stepping out. David runs his hand over his head, a gesture of contemplation. Audrey, leaning against a pillar at the base of the stairs, looks at him, her hand clutching his coat while the other rests in his pocket. With a nod, she turns and departs. David casually tosses his coat over the back of a sofa.\n\nIn a darkened room, the green light on the answering machine blinks insistently. David enters from the unlit landing and presses the button to listen to the messages. Outside, through the relentless downpour, headlights cut through the night. A car comes to a halt before a chain-link fence. The driver's door swings open, and a figure, cloaked and hooded, emerges and approaches the fence. He pauses, a silhouette against the glaring headlights, then reaches up, grasps the fence, and begins to climb.",
    "770": "The ocean completely engulfs the mountains, followed by a massive wave that demolishes a monastery. As the catastrophe unfolds, more people frantically board the ark. A boarding officer notices Uri struggling and rushes to assist him. From the platform, Uri has managed to lift Alec onto a rising structure, but Alec is unable to reach back. Summoning all his strength, Uri grabs Alec's legs and hurls him to safety, only to plunge into a pit himself and fall.\n\nTwo boarding officers forcefully bring a protesting boy onto the ark. The coms officer identifies a hydraulic malfunction that is stopping the gate from closing. Meanwhile, Adriane observes Lily and Noah on a monitor. Dark, raging floodwaters sweep away the air field and the mountains. On the ark's bridge, the Ark office guides Adrian and Laura through a crowded hallway. The crew, awestruck, watches as floodwaters clear the surrounding mountains. A clock begins a countdown from ten seconds as water approaches. The water strikes the ark forcefully from a high angle. Anheuser glares intensely as the countdown tower reaches zero. Lights go out as crashing water envelops the ark, causing the crew on the bridge to be knocked over. Boarding officers and Uri's boys rush away as water crashes around them. A torrent of water surges through a corridor, knocking people down. The crew regains their positions at the controls, and an individual finds himself in a flooded corridor.\n\nNina attends to Tenzen, who has injured his leg. A door abruptly shuts, trapping Lily and Tamara. Tamara manages to free Lily and Caesar but becomes trapped herself in a flooding corridor. On the bridge, Anheuser notices a wrecked plane hovering through the crashing waves. A huge jet forcefully barges through the water, leading to a collision that cracks the anchor away. The ark rises as massive waves curl up and over it. A computer graphic displays the angle of collision between the two arks. The dramatic descent of the arks causes crowds in the hallway to lose their footing. The ark dives headlong, causing chaos as items crash around in the corridor. Adrian and Laura reunite with Lily.\n\nOn the bridge, atop a flat rooftop, the crew observes a computer image of Mount Everest. In the geological bay connecting corridor, Jackson, Kate, Noah, and Tibetans listen to the unfolding events over the speaker. Waist-deep in water, Jackson moves away from the group. Noah fixes a long, steady gaze on his father. Jackson kisses Noah, and before Kate leads the boy away, Jackson kisses her as well. In the flickering light, he turns around and takes a deep breath. Nina, flashing a torchlight, screams for help alongside Tamara in the anti-chamber. Tamara's face presses against a grate as the rising water engulfs her. Jackson swims into the hydraulic chamber and surfaces in an air pocket. Kate attempts to treat the injured Tenzen.",
    "771": "As Noah seizes the moment to swim away while she is distracted, Jackson navigates underwater, his path lit by a torch. Spotting something intriguing, he continues his exploration. Meanwhile, Kate attentively cares for Tenzen. Turning around, she suddenly realizes Noah is missing. Upon finding his jacket, she plunges into the water, soon emerging from the surface. Elsewhere, the ark begins its journey towards Mount Everest.\n\nAdriane activates a monitor, revealing Jackson in a chamber, struggling to liberate Tenzen's power drill. As Jackson looks up, he sees a light and Noah. After surfacing, he dives back into the water. Kate, in another part of the ark, gazes into the darkness while Tenzen communicates with his family, shaking his head in response to their concerns.\n\nWith the water level rising, Nina catches a glimpse of a giraffe through the grill in the ceiling. The ark, scraping against the mountain, challenges Jackson's efforts to free the drill. Laura and Lily are shaken by the turbulence. As the ark nears Everest, the hydraulic chamber's fumes dissipate.\n\nNoah joins his father underwater, where the torchlight reveals the drill entangled in gears. Father and son briefly surface before Jackson is back underwater as the ark collides with a glacier. With a forceful tug, Jackson frees the cable, setting the gears in motion and initiating the closure of the gate. He releases the drill amidst the escalating tension.\n\nAs part of the mountain disintegrates and the ark edges closer to impact, it finally strikes Everest, triggering an avalanche visible to those on the bridge. The ark then begins to distance itself from the mountain.\n\nNoah surfaces in the hydraulics chamber before Kate, leading to a heartfelt embrace between mother and son, as they briefly submerge and then resurface together. Meanwhile, individuals on the bridge and in the zoological bay, hanging onto pipes, peer into the darkness. A beam of torchlight pierces the water as Jackson surfaces once more.\n\nAmidst the celebration, Anheuser surveys the people on the bridge, who are now hugging and cheering. Scotty and Professor West share an embrace. As Kate and Noah continue their hug, Jackson looks over at Nina and Tenzen, receiving a thumbs-up and responding with a nod. The group remains in the water as the ark sails on, leaving Everest behind.\n\nIn his quarters, Adriane works on a laptop, with Laura seated behind him, absorbed in a book. Adriane removes his glasses and smiles, prompting Laura to close her book and return the smile. Rising to their feet, Adriane approaches Laura. They near each other for a kiss, but he hesitates. Laura, determined, wraps her arms around his neck, intensifying their embrace.\n\nElsewhere, Lily notices little Caesar and receives the dog from Alec Karpov. Jackson then approaches Kate. As the massive door of the ark opens, daylight floods the interior, revealing hundreds of people gazing outward. Lily, holding Caesar, and Noah, gripping his mother's hand, stand beside Kate, with Jackson right behind her.",
    "775": "Gordon anxiously monitors the aircraft's controls as a menacing fissure advances toward them. Jackson swiftly guides Gordon's hands to the throttle, prompting Gordon to yank the controls upward. The plane ascends just as the runway crumbles beneath it. Noah watches in awe, eyes wide with shock, as a canyon suddenly yawns beneath them, swallowing buildings as they collapse into the abyss.\n\nSkillfully, Gordon maneuvers the plane through the chaos of tumbling freeway sections, executing a sharp right roll. Below, people desperately flee across fractured and upheaved roads. The plane skims perilously low over the devastated city center. As the streets themselves begin to rise, Gordon battles to gain altitude, while Lilly, sobbing, witnesses people and vehicles plunging into the ominous depths below.\n\nThe aircraft momentarily dips into the rising canyon, narrowly avoiding a train that arcs overhead, crashes into a wall, and erupts in an explosion. The plane successfully clears the canyon, only to face another peril ahead: two high-rise towers collapsing to form an upside-down V. Gordon steers the plane directly through the narrow gap as debris from the shattering buildings surrounds them.\n\nAs the light plane ascends, debris fills the sky, and they narrowly escape the falling tower behind them. Jackson, stunned, observes as the plane leaves behind a city bisected by the colossal fissure. They gaze down at the widespread devastation below. Amidst the chaos, Noah offers a tearful Lilly a comforting embrace. Jackson and Kate turn to follow Gordon's gaze out the windscreen, while behind them, the children press their faces against a side window, staring at the unfolding disaster.\n\nThe Californian coastline gradually rises and then slides into the sea, punctuated by explosions erupting in the streets. Buildings crumble as the entire state fragments and sinks beneath the water.\n\nOn board the Genesis, Harry is handed a drink. He steps off the stage and moves to the galley to take a phone call. Meanwhile, Scotty taps on Adrian's office window. Adrian, asking for a moment, stands up and begins to pace. A sad frown creases Adrian's face as Harry concludes his call. Harry rises again, flags down a passing waiter named Kevin, who pours him a double. Tony, watching from the dressing room, sees Harry drinking.\n\nIn a shift of scene, a biplane flies over the Yellowstone Park research facility. A grazing doe observes as Gordon executes a cautious landing. Jackson quickly exits the plane and inspects a petrol pump before starting their RV. Noah, nearby, answers his phone. Lilly, spotting Charlie on a ridge, alerts the others. As Jackson drives near the ridge, both he and Gordon survey their surroundings skeptically as a vast flock of birds suddenly takes flight.\n\nLilly joins the men on the ridge, and they scan the landscape once more. The mountain range beneath them undulates and rises ominously, with the land itself appearing to sink and then lift upwards. Lilly, feeling the imminent danger, backs away slowly as a funnel of steam bursts through a crack in the ground below. Charlie, watching the spectacle, beams with excitement. The group, spurred into action, dashes past Charlie's motorbike.\n\nGordon steps onto the runway and checks his watch, moments before the Yellowstone mountains are engulfed in a blinding flash, leaving a stunned Charlie on the ridge.",
    "776": "As a catastrophic event unfolds, Kate and Gordon shield their eyes from the initial impact. Simultaneously, Jackson monitors the unfolding disaster through the RV's mirror, witnessing a blinding flash and a subsequent energy wave that flattens the remaining trees and sends Charlie hurtling backwards. A towering inferno and dense black smoke dominate the sky, painting a grim scene.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Kate finds solace in hugging Noah close to her. Charlie, struggling to regain his footing, is bombarded by fireballs descending from a massive eruption, only to be struck by a large debris chunk while standing in a defiant pose. The park becomes a target for relentless fireballs, turning it into a fiery battlefield.\n\nJackson maneuvers the RV through the mayhem, skillfully swerving to dodge falling rocks before aligning the vehicle back on course. Disaster strikes again as a fireball pierces the RV, leaving a flaming hole in its wake. On the runway, Noah anxiously observes from the plane's window, while Kate stands nearby, her anxiety palpable.\n\nThe research center suffers as molten rocks pummel the area, creating havoc. A fissure suddenly splits the ground between the RV and the runway, forcing Jackson to accelerate, causing the RV to leap and narrowly land between the widening canyon. He quickly parks behind the plane, and Kate rushes to meet him as he emerges. She then hurries back to the plane with Lilly in tow.\n\nAs the tarmac cracks ominously, Jackson, still inside the RV, spots a London tube map. His discovery is overshadowed by the emergence of another massive fissure that causes the RV to tip backwards into the abyss. Jackson tumbles down the center aisle but manages to grab a handle in a desperate bid for safety.\n\nFrom the plane's cockpit, Gordon glances back amidst the chaos, setting the plane in motion as fireballs continue to strike the ground near the runway. Amidst this turmoil, a hand clutching a map appears on the edge of the new fissure, followed by another hand, signaling Jackson's narrow escape.\n\nThick smoke envelops the sky as Jackson sprints toward the departing plane. Kate swiftly pulls him aboard just as fireballs continue to rain down, creating thick columns of smoke. As the plane lifts off, it narrowly dodges more fiery projectiles and clears a hilltop, outrunning a volcanic eruption. Dark clouds cast shadows over the plane as it rockets away from the swirling inferno.\n\nInside the plane, Noah gives a reassuring thumbs-up. Kate turns to Jackson, who, catching his breath, unfolds the map he retrieved—a large map of China—prompting dubious looks from everyone onboard. Gordon, from the pilot's seat, surveys the situation.\n\nIn a different part of the world, Adrian hurries into Anheuser's office and follows him into a bustling corridor. Their journey continues into a darkened chapel where Anheuser expresses surprise before turning and exiting. The chapel doors are shut by two agents, leaving Adrian and Wilson in the dimly lit space. Meanwhile, the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue in Rio crumbles, its remains scattering across the city streets, marking another chapter in the widespread catastrophe.",
    "777": "In Las Vegas, smoke fills the sky as buildings burn beside a deep chasm cutting through the town. A light plane approaches McAllen airport, its runway crumbling into the chasm, and lands amidst chaos. Nearby, twins Alec and Oleg stand with Yuri and Tamara by the grounded plane. A mechanic flees the scene, and a fireman compels Yuri to move. A limo arrives at Air Force One, and Adrian emerges and boards the aircraft.\n\nInside the bustling control room of Air Force One, Anheuser hangs up his cell phone amidst rows of computer equipment and terminals. Adrian enters and stands before Anheuser, who tries to decipher his expression. The onboard staff momentarily halts their activities. Adrian watches forlornly as Anheuser exits. Air Force One taxis along the runway. On board, Laura steps out of the president's cabin, greeted by a steward. She re-enters the cabin, picks up the phone, and leans against the wall, sobbing as a light goes out behind Wilson. His secretary, Sally, stands in the doorway as Wilson lowers the phone from his ear. Air Force One then takes off.\n\nBack in the office, Wilson sits in front of a TV camera, and the broadcast fades. Everyone turns to see the fireman's face fall as he closes the glass door, which reflects a rapidly approaching ash cloud.\n\nElsewhere, Sasha guides Jackson and others to a cargo plane, an Antonov, which they board. The cargo hold lights up, revealing a collection of gleaming sports cars. As the Antonov taxis into position, an ash cloud billows across the airport and engulfs the control tower. The plane loses a tire and approaches the damaged end of the runway. It drops and slides into the chasm. Onboard, Yuri holds his sons securely to their seats, and Tamara touches Caesar. Two buildings loom ahead, and Gordon pilots the plane between them, the wingtips narrowly scraping through. They ascend, shaking hands in relief as they clear another building. Gordon stares in disbelief as they fly towards a tall tower, the plane's underside shearing off the tip.\n\nInside the plane, Jackson comforts Noah by patting his hand, while Kate embraces Lilly.\n\nIn Tibet, Nima and Lama Rinpoche sit on the balcony of a small monastery, overlooking a snow-covered mountain range.

A breeze sweeps across the balcony, causing the prayer flags to billow. Rinpoche holds up an object and tosses it to Nema, who catches it—it's a truck key. Nema grins at the key and then at Rinpoche.",
    "781": "In a bustling apartment, a photo of a couple kissing adorns the wall. The city sees a flurry of weddings each week. A man closes his book, gazing into the distance. Jane, in her apartment, forcefully attempts to fit the evening's array of vibrant dresses into an already overflowing closet. She manages to compress the rebellious fabrics, pushing hard against the doors to shut them, but they spring open again. Frustrated, she collects some papers and sinks into the comfort of her couch.\n\nAs the sun sets, its warm rays cast dramatic silhouettes over the city skyline and bathe the buildings along Central Park in golden light, marking the start of rush hour. Kevin, juggling coffee cups, makes his way to the New York Journal offices. Meanwhile, Jane encounters Casey, who steps out of a taxi sporting a stylish white men's shirt. They proceed into their office, where Jane, with a grin, navigates her way to her cluttered desk. Casey shows her a filofax, met with a glare from Jane. Later, they examine photo layouts together. As Gina departs, Jane's expression turns to one of exasperation, and Casey makes a face. Jane's look of pain is evident as the charismatic George strides away, leaving her to deal with a mess of adhesive notes. Casey offers Gina a deceitful smile before flouncing off.\n\nAt the airport, a jumbo jet lands, and Jane beams as her cute blonde sister, Tess, arrives. They reach Jane's apartment, where Jane struggles with the luggage. Later that night, in one of the many city taxis, Kevin peruses Jane's filofax.\n\nAt a lively, dimly lit club hosting Gina's party, Jane and Casey mingle. George suavely approaches them. Breathless, Jane makes her way over to where George is enjoying a beer and conversing with friends. From another direction, Tess, in a dazzling dress, advances. George notices Tess and grins, but then he also spots Jane. As Jane nears, her expression sours upon realizing George and Tess are drawn to each other. They exchange smiles while Jane feigns happiness when George looks her way. As Tess and George exit, Kevin approaches a stunned Jane, who hands him her drink before storming out through a side door. Kevin watches, bewildered, as Jane vents her frustration on a wall with her handbag, all in plain sight of a calm dinner party. Composing herself, Jane returns to Kevin in the club, who waits with raised eyebrows. Her gaze lingers on Tess and George as they leave.\n\nLater, a car passes by Jane's building. Rushing to the front door, she peers through the peephole before yanking it open, only to stomp back inside in agitation. In the living room, she turns on the light, revealing an empty space. Anxious, she paces, eventually picking up a magazine from the couch, settling into a chair, and flipping through it distractedly. Her eyes occasionally dart towards the front door.",
    "785": "A smartly dressed older lady confronts a woman, leaving her puzzled and unsure of what she heard. Meanwhile, Jane, after downing Casey's drink, confidently approaches Tess and George. She stares challengingly at Tess, then stuffs an entire sausage roll into her mouth in one go. As Jane strides away, Tess looks worried but then turns and grins at her, only for her face to freeze as Jane locks eyes with her, picks up a folder from the table behind, and leaves. Casey appears bored during this encounter, and Tess smiles at George.\n\nThe screen then shifts to display cute baby pictures of Tess and George, followed by scenes of their past: young George petting a goat, Tess dangling a cat by its hind legs, George in academic robes, Tess as a cheerleader flirting with footballers, George volunteering at a soup kitchen, Tess in a bikini getting soaked at a car wash, George at the United Nations, Tess in Europe with two guys, George helping with an animal charity, and Tess eating ribs. A slideshow then shows George looking unhappy with his proud parents, juxtaposed with scenes of Tess in a fight, grimacing at a baby, and showing fear of George's dog.\n\nBehind the couple, who are no longer as happy, Casey stands up. Jane looks miserable as Tess runs up to her. Jane tries to speak but no sound comes out; she stands awkwardly, biting her lip, tears welling in her eyes. Casey empathizes with Jane's pain as Jane rushes out of the restaurant, followed by Kevin, who is lurking in the background. Jane looks at Kevin with wide, tear-filled eyes as he waits for her reaction, turns to leave, stops, and returns, holding up a PDA phone with a ribbon on it. He gently places it in her hand, gives her a lingering look, and walks away, leaving Jane to watch him go with a sad half-smile while she looks down at the gift and chokes back tears.\n\nBack at her apartment, Jane places her bag and keys on the hall table and toys with a flower from one of the many vases scattered around. Meanwhile, Kevin sits at his desk, staring gloomily into space until Maureen approaches. He offers her a rueful smile and sinks back thoughtfully into his chair.\n\nJane then finds herself at her father's store where Tess freezes upon noticing her. Jane, unable to meet Tess' furious gaze, is baffled and sits dejectedly on the store counter, staring at the floor. Back at her apartment, she idly brushes her teeth and, upon wandering out of the bathroom, sees her closet full of dresses. In a sudden burst of emotion, she throws open the closet and flings the dresses into the hall, eventually stuffing the last dress into one of several black plastic bags.",
    "789": "In a daring heist, Marcus and Willie start their mission in the back room of a store, where a ladder conveniently leads to an air vent. Willie, in a moment of tension, snaps a popper, prompting a glare from Marcus. As the store's security guard is distracted, bidding farewell to the last of the shoppers, Marcus stealthily crawls through the air vent.\n\nOnce the shoppers and Willie have departed, the guard checks his watch and enters a code into the alarm system. From his vantage point in the air conditioning duct above the security booth, Marcus disables all the security cameras with a remote control. He then quickly makes his way back through the duct, eventually plunging down and crashing through a vent strategically placed above a table of sweaters, which Lois had thoughtfully arranged to cushion his fall. The table gives way under the impact, but Marcus quickly recovers, leaping to his feet and dashing to the alarm console, where he deactivates it just two seconds before it would have triggered.\n\nA service elevator opens, revealing Marcus and Willie stepping out, with Willie pulling a trolley loaded with safe-cracking equipment. They gain access to an office where a large safe commands their attention. Willie, struck by its imposing presence, takes a seat, still staring at it. Eventually, he attempts to crack the safe's combination but fails, resorting instead to drilling into the door, grimacing as he withdraws the bit. Undeterred, he then dons dark goggles and tries to cut through the safe with an arc welder, though the effort proves unsuccessful.\n\nMeanwhile, Marcus embarks on a shopping spree, collecting various items Lois had specified. His antics continue at the mall where he removes a red camisole from a shop dummy and playfully kisses its left breast. He then eyes a mink stole on another mannequin, which is too tall for him to reach directly. After some futile jumping, he spots a mannequin with a golf club, which he uses in an attempt to dislodge the stole. When this fails, Marcus resorts to using the club like an axe, chopping at the dummy's legs until it falls, allowing him to claim the stole.\n\nBack at the office, Willie, frustrated by his lack of progress, uses a sledgehammer on the safe door in a desperate attempt to break it open, though his efforts remain fruitless. Meanwhile, Marcus successfully fells the mannequin and secures the stole. Willie, undeterred, listens to and taps the back of the safe, searching for any weak points, as Marcus enters the office, joining him just as Willie steps out from behind the safe.",
    "790": "Gazing at the open safe door, a smile spreads across his face. Marcus, nodding in agreement, also smiles. Willie exits the office as Marcus starts stuffing a sack with bundles of dollar bills from the safe. Willie then approaches a display of elephant plush toys, noting that some are purple and others pink. He picks up a purple one, inspects it, then sets it back down in favor of a pink elephant. After a brief moment admiring the toy, a soft smile graces his face as he turns to leave, only to freeze at the sound of a revolver being cocked. Marcus, now pointing a gun at him, is joined by Lois who stands behind with a handcart. Willie slowly shakes his head, watching Marcus' expression soften before the gun is raised again. Willie closes his eyes in resignation.\n\nSuddenly, the police arrive on the scene. Marcus ducks behind the handcart, firing at the officers who shoot back. Willie, clutching the pink elephant, dashes away as the toy's head is violently detached by a bullet. He hides around a corner, gasping for breath, but a cop soon spots him and fires a shot, striking the wall next to Willie and blowing off the trunk. Willie continues to run, navigating through the debris of shattered nativity scene statues. Eventually, he bursts out of the store's back door, still holding the headless pink elephant, and jumps into his BMW. He starts the engine and speeds away, smashing a squad car door off its hinges in his escape. A police officer shatters the BMW's back window as Willie drives on, with multiple cruisers in hot pursuit. Glancing back at the following police cars, Willie's BMW rounds a corner onto Thurmond's street, tires smoking. The chase continues down the road.\n\nWillie stops in front of Thurmond's house. Struggling with the car door, he crawls out through the driver's window, still clutching the pink elephant. Nearby children, drawn by the noise, watch as the police open fire on Santa, who is hit multiple times. Clinging to the elephant, Willie crawls toward Thurmond's front door, but as armed officers close in, he collapses on the front step, too injured to proceed. He lies motionless as the police surround him, their weapons drawn, and the screen fades.\n\nThe next scene shows a close-up of the blood-soaked pink elephant during the day. Thurmond, in his room, opens a box on his bed. As he cleans his bicycle outside, a skateboarder approaches. Thurmond, looking around and then down, stands up and delivers a harsh kick to the skateboarder's groin.",
    "786": "In the opening scene, a torch's light beams are cast by a statuesque woman adorned in Grecian robes, setting a mystical tone before the logo fades to black. As the narrative unfolds, a few delicate snowflakes drift down from the night sky, passing by a Christmas tree made of fairy lights atop O'Hara's Pub. On the streets below, a handful of individuals stroll, their arms laden with gifts destined for loved ones.\n\nInside the bustling O'Hara's Pub, various groups—friends, families, and work colleagues—congregate, their laughter and chatter filling the air as they revel in the festive spirit, exchanging presents and sipping drinks. Amidst this convivial atmosphere, at the pub's far end, a lonely figure in a Santa costume, a man in his late 40s with an unshaven, seedy appearance, sits isolated. He nurses two glasses of a potent spirit, a cigarette dangling from his lips as he calls the barman over with a hoarse voice. His eyes, filled with a mixture of sadness and envy, fixate on a nearby group raising their glasses in a toast.\n\nUnsteadily, this Santa figure makes his way out into the cold, navigating a snow-filled back alley. Overwhelmed, he leans against a wall and vomits, his loneliness palpable in the chilly night air.\n\nThe scene shifts to a brightly lit shopping mall where a mother and her young children ascend an escalator. At the top, one child's eyes widen in awe at the lavish Santa's grotto before them. Inside the grotto, an elf, in festive attire, hands a photograph of a girl with Santa to her waiting mother. The girl departs, and an eight-year-old boy approaches, settling onto Santa's lap. Despite his attempt at cheer with a white beard in place, the Santa's seedy demeanor persists as he abruptly shoves the boy off his knee.\n\nA bit later, this same Santa experiences a humiliating moment, wetting himself as his elf assistant approaches. With a sigh, Santa removes his beard, takes a swig from a bottle of grog, and checks his soiled pants. His little helper, observing the scene, shakes his head in despair.\n\nAs the mall prepares to close, a security guard bids farewell to the last of the shoppers. Santa, now shuffling away, watches as the guard enters a code into the alarm system. Meanwhile, up in the grotto, three snowmen are positioned behind statues of Mary and the baby Jesus in a crib. Suddenly, the smallest snowman springs to life, checks to ensure no one is watching, and dashes off, inadvertently knocking over the figures of Mary and Jesus.\n\nThe animated snowman slides down between the mall's escalators as the alarm system's countdown to arming continues. At the bottom, he crashes into a display but quickly regains his footing and dashes through the shop. In a swift motion, he grabs a mannequin's arm and uses it to reach up and deactivate the alarm just before it activates.\n\nIn a revealing moment, the snowman removes his head to unveil Santa's profusely sweating little helper underneath. Now out of costume and in regular clothes, the helper opens a back door only to discover Santa amidst a sea of empty beer cans, a stark contrast to the festive cheer they had been part of earlier.",
    "791": "In a poignant moment, the elf sadly shakes his head. Santa, unimpressed by his elf's demeanor, nonchalantly slips past him into the store. Inside the store's vault, Santa operates a hefty drill to penetrate the locked safe's door. Meanwhile, out on the shop floor, the elf maneuvers a small handcart, and Santa extracts the drill from the safe's breached door. The elf, acting as Santa's little helper, casually pilfers an expensive handbag and designer shoes from a display cabinet, meticulously selecting items off a list. As he consults his list, his gaze falls upon a string of pearls locked in a cabinet; he forcefully uses a bead rack to break it open.\n\nRejoining Santa in the vault, the elf finds him peering intently through the hole he just drilled. Santa then employs a chisel to further his work. With the safe now open, wads of cash spill out onto the floor. An oriental woman, poised at the wheel of a van, watches as Santa and his little helper climb into the back with their loot. She turns to the elf before accelerating, sending the van speeding off and causing Santa and the elf to be thrown backwards.\n\nLater, in a less festive setting, Santa, known as Willie during off-season, shares a dance with Marcus, the elf, in a bar. Willie gently places Marcus on a bar stool, then sits beside him. Willie signals to the barmaid, who promptly serves them. They lift their glasses in unison, quickly down their drinks, and set the glasses back on the counter. Marcus casts a dubious glance at Willie, who, after a moment of consideration, turns back to the barmaid with a half-smile before looking doubtfully at his now-empty glass.\n\nThe scene shifts to a beach where beautiful women in bikinis grace the sandy shore. Willie, now sporting a Hawaiian shirt, works behind a beachfront bar, slicing lemons and limes. He tucks them away under the counter and pours a liberal amount of vodka into a tumbler. As he sips his drink, an irate man clutching a tray of glasses joins him behind the counter. Willie takes a gulp of his drink, but the barman punches him in the stomach and flings him over the counter. Willie retaliates by hurling a vodka bottle at the barman, though he misses. The barman vaults over the counter, prompting Willie to flee the scene.\n\nSometime later, Willie sits alone on the beach, ogling bikini-clad women playing volleyball, licking his lips as he savors the sight of their toned figures and sipping from a beer bottle. The next morning, Willie wakes up in his modest apartment, surrounded by the remnants of the previous night's revelry. As he reaches for the clock radio, he struggles to turn it off; frustrated, he yanks it from its socket.",
    "792": "Willie, in a fit of frustration, smashes a clock and several empty bottles before collapsing onto a bed. In desperate need of refreshment, he reaches for a half-full bottle, ignoring the cigarette end floating inside, and drinks deeply.\n\nA sleek convertible pulls up at a beachside car valeting service. As the driver steps out, Willie approaches casually. The driver hands over the keys to a young valet who drives off with the convertible. Willie then saunters over to a board displaying various car keys. After a quick glance around, he grabs several keys and begins wandering through the parking lot, pressing the remotes. Cars flash and unlock in response. Willie nonchalantly tosses away some keys while continuing to press others until he locates a blue sports convertible that catches his eye. Excited, he approaches it, climbs inside, and opens the glove compartment to find a tax disk. He reads the address on it, puts the disk back, starts the engine, and drives away.\n\nThe blue sports convertible comes to a stop outside a grand mansion with a pillared entranceway. Inside, Willie ascends an elegant marble staircase leading to a balustraded balcony. Upstairs in a stylish kitchen, he guzzles milk straight from the bottle before returning it to the well-stocked fridge. He then snacks on a chicken leg while perched on the toilet. When the toilet fails to flush, Willie fiddles with the handle, stands to inspect it, and ultimately tosses the chicken leg into the toilet bowl. As he wanders aimlessly down the hallway, he casually tips oil paintings off the walls. His attention is drawn to a large portrait of a dark-haired boy on a wood-paneled wall. Willie peeks behind the painting, removes it, and discovers a safe. He listens intently, pressing his ear against the safe as he attempts to crack the combination lock. Noticing a companion set by the fireplace, he selects a poker and forcefully attacks the safe, eventually finding a substantial amount of money.\n\nLater, at an exotic club, Willie remains indifferent to the dancer performing in front of him, his focus solely on scratching a lottery card. As the dancer crawls away towards another customer, Willie continues his scratching. A scantily-clad waitress delivers a beer to him, and he slips a scratch card into her bikini bottoms. She later follows him back to his apartment but wanders off as Willie listens to his phone messages.\n\nDressed once again in festive elf and Santa costumes, Marcus and Willie stride through a shimmering heat in a car park. Willie downs a beer, a cigarette dangling from his mouth. He clutches a bottle of liquor in his left hand, removes the cigarette, and takes a long, satisfying pull from the bottle, draining it completely.",

In the kitchen, he checks the warmth of a teapot. Ferris, armed with a gun, moves through the hallway and into the kitchen. There, he notices and touches a streak of blood on a worktop, rubbing the dark, sticky residue between his fingers. He then steps out onto the balcony to make a phone call.\n\nMeanwhile, Marwan sits alone in a restaurant until Ferris approaches, only to be halted by two bodyguards. Marwan then leaves for Hani's location. Hani, abandoning an attractive woman, walks away with Ferris. They confront each other directly, with Ferris stepping aggressively close to Hani before Hani walks away. Marwan intervenes to stop Ferris from firing.\n\nAt an airport, a hangar door opens, and Ferris, clutching Aisha's phone, rushes toward a small jet. Hoffman disembarks, carrying a shoulder-slung bag. A message with a long phone number appears on the phone, prompting Ferris to make the call.\n\nFerris is then dropped off in a village. A van arrives, and the driver, sporting thick stubble and a cap, exits and opens the back. Ferris climbs into the storage area beneath the back seats. As they drive off, the driver plays a tape. The van travels through the desert under a bright golden sun, following a line of cars and eventually slowing down. At a checkpoint, a soldier with an Alsatian and another in a tank turret stand guard. The soldier checks the driver's papers after waving the van over, while the driver glances back.\n\nThe van continues through the Syrian desert, passing nomads with camels, under a golden sun above distant mountains. It traverses the scorched, barren land, leaving a trail of dust, appearing as a mere dot on the expansive light brown earth when viewed from a surveillance camera. Eventually, the van halts, and the driver opens the back, allowing sunlight to flood in. Ferris emerges, and the driver beckons to him before driving off, leaving Ferris to pace across the flat, dusty terrain dotted with small bushes.\n\nClutching Aisha's phone, Ferris squats and gazes into the clear blue sky, wiping sweat from his face. Hoffman watches him from a surveillance room above. Ferris wanders the dirt until four SUVs approach him. He stares at them, then looks skyward and raises his hands. The surveillance team observes as the SUVs encircle Ferris, kicking up a dust cloud that obscures visibility. Men exit the vehicles and approach Ferris.",
    "802": "A large cloud of dust initially obscures vehicles and men on the screen. Suddenly, a robe lands at Ferris's feet, and a black hood is swiftly placed over his head. Barefoot, he is forcefully guided into one of the vehicles, which, along with three other SUVs, disperses in different directions. As they drive off, the vehicles emerge from the dust cloud, observed by Hoffman as they separate.\n\nOne of the SUVs races down a road and eventually stops in front of a stone building. Armed men promptly open a large gate, through which the hooded Ferris is dragged. Inside, a man with a torch illuminates a dark cell where Ferris sits on the floor, his wrists and ankles tightly bound with cable ties. The man lifts Ferris's hood and offers him a cup of water, which Ferris drinks as it is tipped into his mouth.\n\nLater, Ferris, still hooded, sits at a table with his hands secured to the tabletop with cable ties, palms down. Armed men stand guard around a gloomy room lit by a harsh white light. Behind Ferris hangs a black cloth adorned with a gold disk and Arabic script. Al-Saleem enters, passing a group of men, one of whom is positioned beside a video camera focused on Ferris. As Al-Saleem takes a seat, the hood is removed from Ferris's head. They lock eyes, Al-Saleem's gaze benign. He then gestures with his finger, turning to direct the cameraman to start recording.\n\nAmongst the observers, Ferris spots Karami, triggering a memory of Hani embracing Karami in the desert. Tension escalates as Al-Saleem stands, grabs a hammer from a tool-laden table, and strikes Ferris's little finger, which snaps and bleeds. In defiance, Ferris spits in Al-Saleem's face, who wipes it away calmly before hammering another of Ferris's fingers. Dropping the hammer, Al-Saleem exits, leaving Ferris surrounded by men as he hangs his head in pain.\n\nWalking away through dim corridors, Al-Saleem cleans his hands with a cloth. Meanwhile, an executioner dressed in a black cloak and hat forcefully pulls Ferris's head up by his hair, spits in his face, and violently slams his face onto the table. Ferris, with blood dripping from his nose and mouth, struggles within his restraints.\n\nAs Al-Saleem and an accomplice move through a market downstairs, Ferris's ties are cut by the men who then pull him to the floor. Despite kicking and struggling, Ferris is lifted onto the table, first face down, then flipped onto his back. The men restrain him, holding him spread-eagled as the camera continues to record his ordeal.",
    "805": "Arriving at a bustling street, Skip parks and exits his vehicle. Ferris enters an apartment, tosses his keys onto a table, and surveys the surroundings. The scene shifts to the U.S. Embassy in Amman. Ferris and Skip, driving a silver Audi, approach a checkpoint where Skip presents his identification.\n\nInside a meeting room, an older agent named Holiday sits perched on a desk. Skip leaves the room as images of individuals entering and exiting a house flash across a screen. Holiday, bald and overweight, locks eyes with Ferris before grabbing his coat and departing. Ferris, observing Holiday's exit, then retrieves a file and a case. Skip re-enters the room.\n\nA black SUV navigates through another checkpoint and arrives at the entrance of an impressive building. Ferris, his forehead marked with cuts, steps out clutching a briefcase. He ascends the steps to the entrance hall, where Marwan, a tall bearded man and bodyguard to Hani, greets him. Marwan escorts Ferris through a meeting room and slides open a glass door to reveal an ornate garden. There, a sophisticated middle-aged man, absorbed in his newspaper, sits at a table. Ferris bows respectfully before taking a seat, while Marwan remains in the meeting room.\n\nHani, the middle-aged man, acknowledges Ferris with a nod and a glance towards the building, then pours him a cup of coffee. After their discussion, they return to the meeting room through the glass door, which Marwan closes behind them. Ferris extracts a thick file from his case, and with a furrowed brow, Hani peruses the photographs of groups of men within. Their exchange concludes with mutual nods.\n\nIn a surveillance room, Ferris and Skip drive down a narrow street that leads to a market square. They pause and focus on a large, flat-roofed building across the way. Later, they stand at a coffee store, observing a man in black reading nearby. A young man sits next to their target, who suddenly leaps up and flees, shoving someone aside in his haste.\n\nFrom a large surveillance screen, Hoffman monitors the action as aerial views of the streets are displayed. Ferris chases the fleeing man but loses him amidst a crowd. Skip converges from a different angle as the man continues his escape down a quiet alley. Turning a corner, the man knocks over a cyclist. Ferris, in hot pursuit, watches the man scale a high wall and follows suit. As the man swings a knife at Ferris, two dogs intervene and attack. Ferris forcefully subdues the man by slamming him against a wall and twisting his arm behind his back. Amidst the struggle, a dog bites Ferris' ankle, prompting him to seize the knife and stab the assailant repeatedly, also stabbing the attacking dog. As Ferris attempts to escape over the wall, the dogs continue to bite at his ankles.",
    "807": "In a whirlwind of dust, cars encircle and then halt around Marwan and Hani. The men, including Marwan and Hani, exit their vehicles. With a gesture from Hani, Marwan opens the door for Ferris to step out. Ferris observes as Hani approaches a kneeling figure, removes the hood, and dials a cell phone. Karami answers the call, then hands the phone back to Hani after hanging up. Their eyes meet as Karami rises to his feet, and Hani greets him with a kiss on the cheeks. A bicycle is handed to Karami by one of the men, and he cycles away. Hani then casually walks over to Ferris, who nods thoughtfully. Later, Ferris, walking back to his apartment, is on a call when he spots someone inside his home.\n\nTwo SUVs navigate through gates and come to a stop before the Jordanian General Intelligence Directorate. Ferris and Hoffman disembark and proceed through corridors to meet Hani in a room. Hoffman gives a tense smile as he sits and places a photograph on the table, his gaze fixed on Hani, who in turn looks at Ferris.\n\nInside an SUV, the scene shifts to Hoffman enjoying a thick cigar and a drink with Ferris on his apartment balcony. Meanwhile, children kick a football around the dusty ground in front of the safe house.\n\nIn the bustling market, Skip stands amidst the crowd. Karami, dressed in dark trousers, a pale cream shirt, waistcoat, and skullcap, emerges from a doorway and walks through the market. Spotting Karami, Skip speaks into his earpiece. Karami, wearing sunglasses, strides purposefully through the marketplace with Skip trailing behind. Karami removes his sunglasses and peruses a newspaper while walking down a narrow street, still followed by Skip. A van reversing catches Karami's attention, slowing his pace as he glances at his paper. He then notices Skip, who gestures helplessly, prompting Karami to dash between the van and a building, disappearing down side streets. The van obstructs Skip's path, and two men leap out. Skip futilely bangs on the van's door until it moves, allowing him to squeeze through and chase after Karami, only to find him gone.\n\nFerris, seated on a bed in a health clinic's treatment room, receives a needle jab in his stomach from Aisha, the nurse, who then leaves the room. Ferris follows her out.\n\nThe urban landscape features densely packed concrete buildings with flat, ramshackle roofs. Streets teem with people, where traders hawk their produce from barrows. Ferris walks alongside Aisha, who is wearing a headscarf, as they are photographed. At the clinic, Ferris waits in a room filled with women and children, some of whom look at him with curiosity and smiles. Aisha emerges from her room and smiles warmly at Ferris.",
    "808": "At a cafe, a couple is observed by men as they sit and smile. A waiter delivers tea to their table. An old man watches them with a stony expression. Aisha, feeling anxious, glances at Ferris before lowering her gaze. Ferris leans toward her, prompting a slight smile from Aisha. They then leave the cafe.\n\nApproaching them is Marwan, dressed in a dark suit and exuding an imposing aura. Ferris distances himself from Marwan, but Aisha watches with concern as Marwan forcefully escorts Ferris into an SUV. They drive away, followed by another SUV. Meanwhile, Aisha walks away.\n\nInside the moving SUV, Ferris, visibly tense, is driven past a bustling market square. Meanwhile, a crowd gathers to witness a safe house engulfed in flames, with golden fire erupting from the windows and ascending from the roof. The SUV navigates down a dimly lit street, makes a turn, and halts near the burning structure. Firefighters attempt to extinguish the blaze with hoses.\n\nMarwan and Ferris exit the vehicle. Ferris approaches the fire, shielding his eyes with his hand, squats briefly, then rises and turns to Marwan, who gestures back towards the SUV. The vehicles then proceed to a desolate area, parking among other cars with their headlights illuminating the scene. Men in dark suits are scattered around.\n\nMarwan aggressively pushes Ferris down a littered slope towards Hani. Nearby, one of Hani's agents, armed with a gun, guards a kneeling figure whose head is concealed by a black hood and wrists are bound behind his back. Ferris and Hani confront each other, and Ferris gives a nod. He observes Hani and his men.\n\nFerris, with contempt, approaches Skip, leans down, and assaults him with punches and kicks, sending Skip tumbling down the slope. After spitting at him, Ferris walks away, ascending the slope as Skip remains bound.\n\nThe scene shifts to show the Capitol building's white dome rising amidst a neatly arranged grid of streets. Ferris sits alone at a lakeside cafe, sipping from a take-away coffee cup. Hoffman approaches, but Ferris reacts aggressively, kicking his chair over. Hoffman regards Ferris coolly over his glasses.\n\nElsewhere, a black SUV travels through a forested area and stops at a house flanked by two communications towers. Ferris exits the vehicle and is greeted by a casually dressed, bespectacled man with light-brown hair, who is smoking a cigarette. They exchange a handshake and a smile, and the man, Garland, leads Ferris into the house. As they walk through the cluttered living room, Garland munches on a strawberry. Inside, several computers are arranged on a table, and a parrot perches nearby. Garland points at a computer screen and examines photographs, occasionally furrowing his brow at Ferris.\n\nThe view shifts to a cityscape dominated by skyscrapers. Construction cranes tower beside buildings still under construction, their exposed frameworks resembling giant honeycombs. In a hotel room, Ferris dries his wet hair with a towel and applies a foamy white solution.",
    "809": "Ferris examines his reflection in a mirror, noting the light-brown highlights in his hair. At a construction site office, he converses with a bald agent disguised as a construction worker. Sadiki enters the scene. As Sadiki and Al-Masri exchange handshakes, Tony captures the moment with his camera from inside a parked car.\n\nFerris retrieves a room key from the hotel clerk and proceeds upstairs along a corridor. He unlocks a hotel room, walks through it, and steps out onto the balcony. He then scales a wall, edges along a ledge, and climbs onto the adjacent balcony. Peering through the French windows, he moves a long curtain aside to see inside.\n\nInside the room, Ferris approaches a laptop on the dressing table. He inserts a device into the computer's rear socket, powers it up, and presses several keys. A photograph of Sadiki with his family displays on the screen. Ferris dials his cell phone. Meanwhile, Garland is seen at another computer, where multiple files appear on Ferris's laptop.\n\nDown in the hotel lobby, Sadiki approaches the desk to collect his room key and ascends to his room. Hearing Sadiki's approach, Ferris hastily closes the laptop and switches off the desk light. He then escapes through the French windows, traversing back across the balconies to the next room.\n\nSadiki enters his room, retrieves money from a bag, pockets it, and adjusts the chair at the dressing table. Noticing the open French windows, he investigates, pulls back the curtain, and closes the window.\n\nIn a lighter scene, Hoffman watches a kids' soccer match, taking a photo as his daughter prepares to throw the ball. He converses on his hands-free mobile.\n\nA jet lands at Queen Alia International Airport in Amman. Marwan meets Ferris in a corridor and leads him to an office where Hani is seated, reading a newspaper. Ferris takes a seat as Hani sets aside his paper. Later, Ferris meets Skip.\n\nFerris climbs into the back of an SUV. At a health clinic, Aisha measures Ferris's blood pressure before removing the cuff, and they share a smile. At a cafe, Ferris selects a pastry, and the man behind the counter packs them into a box.\n\nDriving an SUV through town, Ferris parks near an apartment block. Carrying the box of pastries, dressed in brown trousers and a white shirt, he ascends to an apartment. Aisha greets him at the door with a smile. Ferris closes the door behind him and follows Aisha inside.\n\nInside the apartment, Yousef and Rowley are watching football on TV. Ferris joins the boys on the sofa. Cala places bowls on the table. Ferris leans in closer to the boys, who nod in acknowledgment. Ferris then smiles warmly at Aisha, who stands by the table.",
    "811": "Under a foreboding sky, a road races by as lightning strikes a barren tree, instantly bringing it to life with sprouting leaves. Inside a bustling store, teenage girls excitedly slip into vibrant, funky shoes, while nearby, a little girl reluctantly tries on unremarkable brown ones. The long-haired teens laugh at her, but her mother soon ushers her away down the street, where she watches, awestruck, as women try on various outfits and pay with credit cards.\n\nYears pass, and the little girl, now grown, steps into a high-end store. She spritzes perfume and shares a warm hug with a shop assistant, drawing a simper from her colleague, Claire. At home, Rebecca, with her flowing red hair and tartan cape, scrutinizes her credit card bill, finding the supposedly missing card. Later, in a washroom, her friend Suze peruses Rebecca's resume.\n\nStriding down a chic shopping street, Rebecca pauses before the window of Denny and George, her jaw quivering with excitement at the sight of a green chiffon scarf on a mannequin. She enters the store, her steps deliberate as she approaches the scarf. To her astonishment, the mannequin speaks to her. Rebecca quickly crosses to an assistant, her emotions shifting from tension to radiant joy as she pulls out a second card.\n\nEagerly, Rebecca dashes down the street towards a hot dog stand with a long queue. A man ahead pays for her meal with a $20 bill, then turns to face her. With her new green scarf billowing behind her, she races to a towering, glass-topped building, riding the elevator and stumbling towards the reception with an apricot-colored briefcase. A pair of striking six-inch heels approach, belonging to a tall, blonde woman in a black dress with a fur collar who gives Rebecca a swift, assessing glance. Rebecca's bag bursts open, prompting a forced smile as the woman, Alicia, smirks and strides away. Turning back, Rebecca snatches a visitor's card from the pixie-like receptionist.\n\nIn the waiting room, seated between four others engrossed in broadsheets, Rebecca feels the brunette next to her watching disapprovingly. She soon finds herself in the office of the Englishman from the hot dog stand, hastily removing and discarding her scarf under a desk as he recognizes her and takes a seat. As she fumbles with her briefcase's lock, the editor's face contorts in reaction, leaving Rebecca feeling like a deer in headlights. Yet, the man rests his chin on his hand, gazing at her with a gentle expression.\n\nLeaving the office, Rebecca collides with a glass partition. On her way back, she walks along a sunlit pavement under towering fashion posters. Back at the office, she faces an immediate termination notice, and she and another girl stare at the phone, pondering their next move.",
    "812": "Suze's boyfriend, Tarquin, enters the scene, visibly shell-shocked and clutching a lamp. The girls slump in their seats, overwhelmed by the situation. Tarquin passes the lamp to Suze, who subtly gestures towards the door with a jerk of her head. Across the kitchen table, Suze slides a pile of bills towards Rebecca, who promptly pushes them back. Seeking solace, the girls quickly down shots and dash out into the street.\n\nThe next morning, Rebecca tumbles off her bed. She and her friends race to a nearby post box. As they make their way, a bag lady passes by, pushing a packed supermarket trolley. Later that day, Rebecca visits a flea market with her parents, Jane and Graham. Her father entertains them with a magic trick, pulling a waistcoat from thin air. Amidst the family outing, Rebecca's phone buzzes, summoning her to the Dantay-West building.\n\nArriving at the building, Rebecca rides the lift upward. Just as a postal worker wheels in a trolley of mail through the glass door, she spots her distinctive pink envelope nestled among the stacks. As the lift opens, a man wheels out a clothes rail, causing Rebecca to step aside. She then ducks behind the rail to sneak through the door, slipping her arm into a coat hanging there in an attempt to reach her letter. In a desperate move, she tries to hook the letter with a stiletto heel, even swinging at the post trolley with the shoe. To conceal herself, Rebecca wraps up in a blue fur coat. Meanwhile, Alette strides off, and the clothes rail is wheeled away, leaving Rebecca on the floor, triumphantly clutching her letter.\n\nAt the office, Rebecca, dressed in pink, manipulates an article on her pink laptop before entering a query into Google. Leaning in, she scans the results that appear on her screen. In another scene, Luke peers oddly at Rebecca, prompting her to glance towards Hayley, who beams inanely. Luke leans forward, intrigued by the unfolding dynamics.\n\nRebecca and Suze then find themselves in a bookshop. Rebecca attempts to copy information from a book they have. Back at home, they settle in to watch a DVD together. Amidst the clutter of their living space, Rebecca packs clothes into plastic bags and shoves them into a cupboard, which she closes, despite it being full to bursting. Meanwhile, mannequins in a store window seem to beckon to her.\n\nAt a conference, all eyes turn to Rebecca, who gulps nervously under the scrutiny. Luke smiles broadly, like a Cheshire cat, while Mr. Xander appears cornered by the situation. Luke's grin widens, surprised by something Rebecca says, which fills her with newfound optimism. As she strides confidently down a street, a piece of paper flutters down and lands on her chest; it's a flier for a sample sale.\n\nIn Luke's luxurious penthouse, his boss Ryan swings a virtual golf club, sending a virtual golf ball across a digital course. Rebecca finds herself standing in the queue for the sample sale, watching as women emerge from a door, proudly striding past with their purchases. As another door opens, the women in the queue turn their heads in anticipation.",
    "815": "At a high-class event, a woman notices a loose thread on her jacket. She accidentally tears the sleeve while trying to fix it. Alicia gracefully moves towards Alette, while Rebecca, sporting crimped hair, dashes to a side table in an attempt to mend the tear with a canapé. As two women emerge from the powder room, Rebecca makes a beeline for the door. A woman, in the midst of drinking champagne, catches Rebecca's jacket on the door as she passes, causing beads to scatter on the floor. The champagne-drinking woman loses her balance, and they tumble into each other's arms. The woman then tugs at Rebecca's other sleeve, leading Rebecca, now without her jacket, to assist the woman to a seat.\n\nLater, Rebecca finds herself in the kitchen, dressed in what resembles a waitress uniform. She is pushed into the ballroom with a tray of food but tries to return to the kitchen. The stern manager hisses at her. Facing Alette's table, Rebecca twirls around and bumps into a waiter, sending fish flying. Luke quickly stands up and takes Rebecca's trays, while Alicia's lips purse and Alette giggles.\n\nOn a romantically lit rooftop later that evening, Luke removes his tuxedo and drapes it over Rebecca's shoulders. He gives her an enigmatic sideways glance before their lips meet. The next morning, Rebecca arrives at work wearing a red dress with a fluffy orange shrug and swinging an orange bag. She rides the escalator, a soft smile playing on her lips. A man in a gray coat on a lower escalator catches her eye. Coolly, she struts away but suddenly bursts into a run and dives into a lift, only to be stopped by a black briefcase blocking the doors.\n\nDerek Smeath enters the lift, positioning himself opposite Rebecca. She steals a glance at him, noting his dark hair, pale complexion, glasses, and gray raincoat. The lift stops at Dantay-West Publications floor, where several people exit, and Smeath glances at Rebecca. More people board the lift, and she eyes his sturdy, black briefcase. Rebecca retrieves her mobile, scrolling past Bergdorf, Bloomingdale's, and Chanel to find Derek Smeath's contact. She slowly brings the phone to her ear, smiling at a man who has just entered the lift, while Smeath remains expressionless and motionless. Rebecca cancels the call and hastily shoves her phone back into her bag, only to frantically search through it in horror.\n\nThe lift arrives at Trout and Bass on the fifth floor, prompting Rebecca to flee. She looks back as Smeath looks up, their eyes meeting; a slow, smug smile spreads across his face. Rebecca dashes for the stairs and runs through the office door just as Smeath exits the lift. She freezes, watching as Smeath is forcibly removed, allowing her frozen smile to relax. Finally, Alette's chauffeur-driven car arrives at a store.",
    "820": "Bernie reverses out of the driveway and accelerates down the road, tightly gripping the steering wheel. Desperately honking her horn, Jessica pursues him and runs a red light in her haste. Upon entering the back garden, Molly greets her with a glass of champagne as a Crazy Golf windmill stands nearby. Suddenly, Bernie knocks Cal down, only for Jacob to pull him off. In retaliation, Bernie punches Jacob and then forcefully removes the sails from the windmill, subsequently dropping them. A chaotic brawl ensues with all four men wrestling, struggling, and eventually tumbling down together. They end up sitting side by side on a wall, with David applying an icepack to his cheek as police officers appear on the scene. The officers leave after the group disperses, with Jacob laughing and David and Bernie turning to look at Cal.\n\nAs the tension lingers, Emily lets out a heavy sigh while Hannah and Jessica stare at the ground. Bernie rises and begins to limp slightly as Jessica scurries after him, nervously running her fingers through her ponytail. Robbie watches them go and then jogs after them, only to stop at the end of the driveway. Jessica glances back at Robbie, her expression filled with shame, as Robbie turns away and shuffles back dejectedly. Meanwhile, the other three men remain seated on the wall. Cal stands, prompting a bitter smile and head shake from Emily, and a frown from Hannah, whose eyes fill with hurt. Emily glares at Cal as he locks eyes with her, jaw clenched in anger. Hannah gives Jacob a small nod, and he rises to follow her as she turns and wanders away. Molly emerges as Hannah and Jacob leave the scene.\n\nRobbie, overcome with emotion, lets his head drop forward. Cal, with a furrowed brow, looks down at the ground as Emily continues to eye him angrily with her arms folded. Cal then approaches Robbie, who is leaning against the house wall, and gives him a smile and a nod before leaving. Molly, overwhelmed, sits down on the garden steps and puts her head in her hand as Cal lumbers down the driveway.\n\nAt school, kids pass by Robbie, who sits alone on the stairs with his head bowed. He presses Jessica's name on his phone's contact list. In her bedroom, Jessica lounges on her bed, staring into the distance. Meanwhile, in Jacob's apartment, Hannah and Jacob are together, and Jacob holds out the phone to Hannah. Emily, sitting at her desk in her office, writes before looking up with a sad pout.\n\nAs students pour out of the school building, Cal stands by his car and spots Robbie. However, Robbie eyes him balefully and heads off in another direction. Later, at a bar, Cal sits at the counter with his head resting on his hands, hunched over with his head hung low. He raises his head as Jacob sits down next to him, scanning the bar. The bartender serves Cal a shot and shrugs at Jacob. Both Cal and Jacob stare down at the bar before Jacob looks away.",
    "819": "In the opening scene, the exteriors of vintage film studio buildings are mirrored on a gleaming gold surface, setting a nostalgic tone. Inside a restaurant, beneath a table, the high heels of a woman and the brogues of a man are visible, indicating a date or meeting. Nearby, another couple's feet can be seen under different tables, engaging in similar interactions. One woman hesitantly extends her foot, gently brushing it against a man's, an act mirrored by other couples, whose feet seem to magically gravitate towards each other. In contrast, a man in running shoes and a woman in high heels sit apart, their feet maintaining distance.\n\nAt their table, a middle-aged couple, engrossed in their menus, represents Cal and Emily. Cal occasionally scratches his eye and steals glances at Emily, who is deeply focused on her menu. Cal's wide-eyed staring continues as Emily attempts to speak but hesitates, her words caught in her throat.\n\nElsewhere, a lively scene unfolds as a teenage girl chases a younger one, Molly, around a house. Molly leaps onto a sofa, only to be tickled by the older girl, causing a photo frame to topple and crack. Molly quickly scampers away, leaving the babysitter, Jessica, to pick up the fallen frame. Jessica examines the photo with care, revealing it to be a joyful image of Emily embracing Cal. A wistful smile crosses Jessica's face as she places her hand over Emily in the photo, momentarily obscuring Cal.\n\nReturning from their evening out, Emily and Cal drive home in tense silence. Emily repeatedly tries to initiate conversation, licking her lips nervously and glancing at Cal, who remains fixated on the road ahead. Shaking her head, Emily's frustration is palpable.\n\nBack at the house, Jessica expresses disgust through her gestures, while in his room, Robbie, overwhelmed, covers his face with a pillow. In the car, Cal's expression hardens as Emily continues to glance at him, pursing her lips in concern.\n\nSuddenly, Cal opens the car door and listlessly falls out onto the road. Emily quickly stops the car and rushes to his side, where he sits hunched over. She watches in disbelief as he stands up on his own and trudges back to the car, leaving her to follow.\n\nAt the house, Jessica busies herself tidying the coffee table in the living room. Robbie, about 13, enters and leans against an archway, hands tucked into his pockets. He nods ruefully before his gaze lifts, and he sighs, prompting Jessica to cringe and pause in reflection.\n\nIn a different setting, two young women are at a bar. Liz watches her friend Hannah with concern as Hannah slumps and pouts, evidently troubled. Meanwhile, a confident man strides through the bar, dressed sharply in a maroon suit and polished brown leather shoes, adding a final touch of sophistication to the varied tapestry of scenes.",
    "822": "In a bustling upmarket bar, Hannah radiates joy as she beams at a handsome man, Jacob, who watches her with a smile as she briskly makes her way halfway to the door, shrugging on her coat. Meanwhile, Cal drives down a dimly lit street with Jessica beside him in the passenger seat. She gazes down uncomfortably, steals a glance at Cal who remains focused on driving, then quickly looks away, her head hung low. She peeks at him again, fraught with trepidation, only to avert her gaze once more. Cal subtly shakes his head, prompting Jessica to nod in response. He offers a small smile before abruptly covering his mouth with his hand, then presses his hand to his forehead in contemplation. As they reach their destination, Cal pulls up outside a house. Jessica, her frown deepening, nods again before stepping out. Standing outside the house, the tall and slightly gangly Jessica watches Cal drive away, her brow furrowed in forlorn contemplation.\n\nBack at the bar, patrons are leaving as Cal sits alone, resting his head on his hand and staring down glumly. He begins to drum his fingers on the countertop, a gentle smile crossing his face as he turns to lean towards a woman on his left. She turns towards him, but soon he shakes his head and she returns to her conversation with a friend. Cal taps his glass against the bar, laughs at his own jest, and then looks over to see Jacob entertaining a group of women with his charm. Sipping his drink through a straw, Cal observes the scene.\n\nIn a different setting, a balding man navigates through an open-plan office, knocking on a glass door. His colleague feigns surprise, and as Cal prepares to leave, his colleague offers him a pat on the back. Amidst the office, applause breaks out, and Cal, eyes closed, absorbs the moment.\n\nThe scene shifts to a gentle rain falling outside, highlighting a pretty garden adorned with white and red rose bushes, furnished with two chairs, a table, a wooden bench, and a climbing frame. At the edge of this serene setting, Cal stands solemnly beside a rental truck. Nearby, Emily pinches the bridge of her nose as tears brim in her eyes. She nods, maintaining eye contact with Cal, who looks at her intently, causing her to reel slightly. Their gaze lingers poignantly before Cal climbs into the driver's seat of the truck and closes the door. Emily watches him reverse, walking alongside the truck with her arms folded before lowering her gaze.\n\nReturning to the lively bar, now bustling with chatter, Cal is again alone at the counter, sipping a vodka cranberry through a straw. Across from him, Jacob, dining alone on a burger and chips, wipes his mouth with a napkin, stands, dons his suit jacket, and glances at Cal, who quickly averts his eyes back to his drink. Jacob then approaches a table of young women, initiating conversation. Cal, observing this, shakes his head disapprovingly and sighs.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts as a middle-aged man dressed in a shirt and tank top enters the scene.",
    "823": "Cal, sitting at a bar, waves casually as his friend indulges in a glass of wine. Bernie, another man at the bar, watches Cal with anxious eyes before lowering his gaze. Bernie then places a Macy's bag on the counter, prompting a bewildered frown from Cal. Rising from his seat, Bernie leaves the bar, while Cal responds with a shrug and a smile.\n\nAt a nearby table, Jacob sits with a woman. Cal, appearing woeful, catches Jacob's attention. Jacob beckons to Cal, who initially looks over his shoulder, perhaps searching for someone else. However, Jacob's insistent gesture draws Cal over. Thoughtfully, Cal observes Jacob, picks up his drink and cologne, and walks towards Jacob's table just as the woman departs. Cal nods, takes a seat, and sets down his glass, all the while maintaining eye contact with Jacob. Jacob takes a swig from his drink, nods back at Cal, and tilts his head curiously as Cal studies him. Both men raise their glasses in a silent toast; Cal drinks without using his straw. Jacob then signals to the woman, who has returned, and points at Cal before leaving the table with her, the woman offering Cal a smile as they exit. Cal watches them go and then settles back into his chair, sipping through his straw.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly as Molly bursts in front of a TV, dancing energetically. Meanwhile, Cal and Robbie lean against a kitchen counter; Robbie slumps, resting his head on his hands, as Jessica smiles at him. Robbie fidgets awkwardly and looks down, feeling the weight of her gaze.\n\nIn a bustling mall, Cal rides an escalator upward and then strolls through the shopping center. At a bar, Hannah and Liz are part of a lively group, all raising their glasses in celebration. A dark-haired, slightly gawky man kisses Hannah, eliciting an excited smile from her. She glances over at him with affection, her smile unwavering. Liz departs, leaving Hannah to observe her boyfriend, who is engrossed with his phone beside another similarly preoccupied man. Hannah's initial joy fades as her eyes dart around, reflecting a sudden shift in her mood.\n\nOn the mall's roof terrace, Jacob stands by a glass barrier, smartly dressed in a dark suit, brown shoes, and sunglasses. He bites into a piece of folded pizza, leans against the barrier, and peers over the edge. As Cal approaches, dressed casually in a baggy striped polo shirt, blue jeans, and running trainers, Jacob looks up and chews thoughtfully. Checking his watch, Jacob shrugs nonchalantly before dramatically throwing Cal's trainers over the barrier, delivering a slap to Cal's cheek, and then marching away. Cal, initially smiling in disbelief, quickly relents and pulls out his wallet. Jacob looks down at the wallet with a dry expression, then frowns incredulously at Cal.\n\nCal then engages in a shopping spree, trying on various shirts and ties, and browsing through racks of sunglasses with Jacob. Laden with numerous shopping bags, Cal's credit card is swiped, and again in a beauty product store, marking the end of their shopping adventure.",
    "825": "In the gym, Jacob impressively performs handstand push-ups. They then move to a sauna where Cal unexpectedly faints onto Jacob's crotch. Later, at a bustling bar, Jacob and Cal are seen; Cal signals for another drink by tapping his empty glass, prompting a frown from Jacob. Cal glances around, Jacob tweaks his nose, and Cal, reflecting on his marriage, removes his wedding ring. As they navigate through the bar, Jacob saunters off, leaving Cal to sit next to an attractive woman in her forties. Cal studies her intently, bites his lip, and after winking at her, takes a sip of his drink.\n\nTheir evening continues back at Cal's dimly lit apartment where they share passionate kisses. The woman removes Cal's jacket, kisses him, but suddenly pulls back. She then pushes him onto the couch, elevates her leg onto it, and energetically leaps onto him, straddling him. The next morning, Cal, with a sense of routine, ushers her out; her hair disheveled, they share a final kiss before she departs and Cal closes the door.\n\nOver subsequent nights, stylishly dressed in varying suits, Cal engages with numerous women at different spots in the bar, from a young brunette to a petite woman, and another showing off her ring. He leaves the bar hand-in-hand with a stunning young woman in a sleek green dress. Meanwhile, Jacob, at the bar, smirks and rubs his head while sharing drinks with Cal. Nearby, Liz is seen absorbed in her mobile phone.\n\nIn another part of the story, at school, Jessica retrieves books from her locker and spies on a girl with long blonde hair, Madison, who eventually walks away. Jessica follows, jogging around a corner to find Madison waiting for her, clapping her hands in a flipper-like motion before departing. As Madison opens the door, sunlight dramatically illuminates Jessica's face.\n\nOutside, students pause, their attention drawn to a red curtain set up in a yard, encircled by a curious crowd. Jessica and her friends approach; the curtain falls to reveal Robbie standing on a platform behind it. Jessica, shocked, drops her tray. Robbie locks eyes with her, his expression grave, as she walks away. He watches her leave with sadness, lets out a heavy sigh, and trudges back into the school.\n\nIn a peaceful scene, bright sunlight filters through the trees in Emily's garden. Someone meticulously tends to the landscape, snipping the hedge with large shears and pruning the rose bush with clippers while another mows the grass. Emily observes from the porch, a smile playing on her lips, content with the scene unfolding before her.",
    "837": "Sandy, in a moment of surprise, does a double-take. With a smile, she waves and shifts her timid gaze toward the bar. A man smiles at Diana as he rises from his seat. Diana, in response, fidgets with her necklace. They then settle at a table, enjoying the stunning vista of the Gateway Arch. Sandy sips her champagne, nodding, though her smile gradually fades. The man gazes into her now somber eyes. Diana, also sipping champagne, wipes her eyes as Sandy's expression softens. He turns his attention to the table while Diana wipes her cheeks and lowers her gaze to her hands. He offers her a napkin. As Sandy takes another sip, Ken, the hotel manager, along with several policemen, enter the room behind her.\n\nAs the officers handcuff them, Sandy exchanges a frightened glance with Diana. An officer escorts Sandy out, while the others follow with Diana. The restaurant's patrons, astonished, watch from their tables. The group moves past the hostess and into a hallway where an elevator awaits. As the doors close, Julian and Marisol, impeccably dressed in a suit and a sleek black dress respectively, enter and stand at the front, turning their backs to everyone. Diana's eyes widen upon noticing them; she looks back and forth between Sandy and the thugs. As Sandy looks up, Marisol turns away, and he steps forward to size up Julian. They exit into the lobby, and Julian casts a glance backward. Sandy and Diana share a concerned look as they leave, noting that the thugs have veered into a different hallway.\n\nIn a prison cell, Paolo reaches for his phone. A skiptracer shoots Julian in the leg, prompting Marisol to raise her hands in surrender, only to be shot in the foot. The thugs are then placed in a car's trunk. Outside, an officer leads Diana around a squad car, with Sandy glancing over as they both climb into the back seat. Diana stares ahead, avoiding Sandy's gaze. Nearby, the skiptracer watches them from a silver sedan belonging to the thugs, quickly tailing the departing squad car.\n\nThey drive down a street crowded with construction, the lanes separated by orange traffic cones. Sandy looks straight ahead from the back seat, while the skiptracer, with a determined glare, closely follows. Diana glances at Sandy before leaning toward the grated divider that separates them from the officers. She manages to free one of her hands, then forcefully bangs her cuffed wrist against the back windshield and kicks out the glass. The skiptracer swerves, executing a 180-degree spin, and crashes into the side of the squad car. Another vehicle rear-ends them. Sandy and Diana crawl out of the wreckage. The skiptracer aims his weapon and drives forward, pushing several cars aside, and plows through traffic dividers into the opposite lane. They spot a highway below them as the skiptracer maneuvers through oncoming traffic. Following Diana, Sandy stumbles off the curb and into a closed lane, just as the skiptracer crashes through the barriers, heading directly toward him.",
    "839": "Trish, lying on her back, gazes at the ceiling before turning to her husband. She rises on her side, tenderly grabbing Sandy's shoulder, and leans in to kiss his head. Sandy briefly smiles, and the couple stares thoughtfully into the darkness. Trish tilts her head, glancing at Sandy, and kisses the back of his neck while rubbing his shoulder. She then lies down behind him.\n\nLater, Sandy enters the living room to find his two young daughters asleep on the couch. Diana is on the floor beside them, holding Frannie's hand. Sandy stands over them and turns off a table lamp. As he slowly exits, the camera focuses on Diana and Frannie's clasped hands.\n\nWaking up, Sandy checks the clock and buries his face in his pillow. He then opens his bedroom door and walks down the hall, where he discovers Frannie and Jessie wearing gaudy makeup reminiscent of Diana. He peeks around the corner before returning his attention to his daughters. Jessie rises, retrieves a note, and hands Sandy a folded pink paper, which he unfolds.\n\nAt work, Sandy walks past colleagues in suits, nodding curtly at the receptionist's desk. He gives a weak wave to someone and then pauses at his office, eyeing his name placard on the glass door before joining an ongoing meeting in the conference room. Daniel looks up and points behind Sandy, who turns to see Diana through the glass walls, seated across from a detective with two officers watching. Sandy steps closer, intently observing the conversation, then opens the door and enters stiffly. After the officers leave, Sandy shoots Diana a wide-eyed stare. Diana, in a flowing black dress, is led away in handcuffs by the police. Sandy exits the office and watches as Diana, turning with a teary smile, is escorted away by an officer.\n\nSandy then approaches Daniel, who walks off, leaving Sandy alone. The scene fades to black.\n\nIn a subsequent scene, Trish carries a cake across the yard to a table where Sandy is cradling their newborn. He checks his watch.\n\nIn a prison visiting yard, Diana holds up an exam displaying an A-plus grade. She gives Franny a big hug and reaches out for Jessie. Diana pulls a document from a large yellow envelope, inspects it, and pats the birth certificate before sliding it across to Sandy. She stands from the picnic table, passes behind him, then abruptly turns and embraces him. Sandy looks at her, smiles, and gathers up the envelope and paperwork as he stands.",
    "835": "In an office, a handsome, well-groomed man, engrossed with his cell phone, promptly answers a call. Meanwhile, at a food court, a plump redhead, elated, pumps her fist as she converses on her phone. Transitioning to a cluttered house, this same woman, after drying her hair, confidently punches numbers into a keypad. Along a mirror in the same space, various fake IDs bearing her photograph dangle from a string. A machine then dispenses a credit card with the name Sandy printed on it, which she promptly adds to her collection of counterfeit cards before departing with a resolute look.\n\nThis redhead, now at a trendy bar, enters wide-eyed and confidently approaches the bartender. She eyes two men taking shots and hands over Sandy's newly acquired card. She then joins the men, downing a shot herself. Her boldness escalates as she chugs a bottle of green liqueur, triumphantly raising her arms upon finishing. The bartender, keeping track, adds drinks to her tab, which rapidly accumulates to over $2,000. Standing on a table, she hurls a bottle and daringly leaps for the chandelier, only to land flat on the floor. Bar patrons watch her lie still until, startled by a few pokes, she springs up. As the frustrated bartender approaches, she high-fives some patrons before shockingly punching him in the throat, causing him to collapse.\n\nSoon, a police car arrives at the scene. Later, two officers escort the redhead out of the bar. She complies with a breath test but spews green vomit on one officer, who shakes it off as she turns to face the other. At the police station, the identity thief, still plump, stands against a height chart for booking.\n\nIn another part of town, the real Sandy celebrates his birthday surrounded by his stunning wife and two young daughters. Amidst the festivities, his wife playfully presents him with a paper tie. Sandy, in good spirits, lifts her up and playfully smears her face into the birthday cake. The moment turns more intimate as she straddles his lap, locking eyes with him. He pulls her close for a tender kiss, to which she responds with a raised eyebrow. The celebration concludes as Sandy carries her out of the room.\n\nThe next day, Sandy drives slowly through heavy traffic on a congested highway. Later, carrying a briefcase, the well-groomed businessman navigates through an enclosed courtyard and enters an office building. Inside, he steps off an elevator and heads to his office, where a suited co-worker approaches him. Sandy sets down a file and follows Cornish's assistant, peeking into an office where Cornish invites him in with a gesture. Inside, Cornish points to an earphone and prevents Sandy from sitting, then shuts the door for privacy.\n\nSandy proceeds to a records room, entering by inputting a code into a keypad. He moves to a computer station shielded by a cage wall and holds up a packet listing partners with significant bonuses next to their names. At the bottom of the list, Harold Cornish's name appears with a bonus of $1.2 million. On the computer, Sandy types Cornish's name onto a check and, mid-process, answers his cell phone.",
    "842": "Sandy's tumultuous journey begins when a redhead seizes his suitcase, unzips it, and discovers clothes alongside a toiletry bag. Meanwhile, a vibrant blue and yellow taxi pulls up outside. Sandy emerges from the taxi, clutching a pink slip, his shirt drenched with a large sweat stain down the front and another even more prominent one on his back. He settles the fare with the driver, casts a wary glance at the house, and then stealthily jogs along its side, cautiously entering through the back gate. Peering through a window, Sandy catches the redhead rummaging through his toiletries; she unabashedly applies his deodorant to her armpits as he stealthily enters the room. Quickly, he produces handcuffs, and she complies, though not for long. She retaliates by punching his throat, prompting a scuffle where he grabs her leg, causing her to fall. She retaliates by slapping his face, then, standing, she maneuvers him against the counter and hurls him over a chair. As she makes a dash for freedom, Sandy throws a small appliance at her, then strikes her with a guitar amidst scattered IDs.\n\nSuddenly, the tension escalates as two thugs appear at the door, and a gunshot blows off the doorknob. Sandy and Diana make a break for it as the female intruder, accompanied by her male counterpart armed with a short gun, bursts in. Diana, quick and decisive, punctures two tires of their vehicle with a knife and rushes into Sandy's car. In their haste to escape, Sandy accidentally backs over a mailbox and into the neighbor's yard, knocking over a sign. In an attempt to restrain the female thug, he cuffs their hands together, but she manages to rip the knife out of the tire just as Sandy speeds off. The thug, undeterred, picks the lock and frees herself, then reaches into her shirt.\n\nForced to pull over, Sandy encounters a hitchhiking woman. Diana, visibly irritated, glares at the scene. As the woman bolts, Sandy effortlessly catches up to her overweight figure. Diana, seizing the moment, snatches his keys and runs, mockingly flashing her middle finger as she jogs slowly. Sandy overtakes her and confronts her as she stumbles to a stop. With a roll of his eyes and crossed fingers, he faces Diana. Their eyes lock, and she limps toward the car with Sandy following. He retrieves the keys from the middle of the highway and hurries back to the car.\n\nThe scene shifts to an auto garage where a muscular, tattooed mechanic is hard at work, watched closely by the female thug who lifts her phone. Elsewhere, an aging man sits in a jail cell, his brow furrowed. A prisoner bribes a guard within the same facility. Back in Sandy's car, Diana, lips pursed and eyes wide, faces Sandy. She dances in her seat, prompting him to change the radio station, though he glares as she mimes playing instruments. They speed over a bridge above a small river.\n\nSimultaneously, a roughneck man with weathered skin and a gray goatee approaches a van. Later, the aging man, now in his brand new van, arrives at a strip mall. He stops outside a salon, peering inside before entering. Inside, a young brunette stylist is sweeping the floor. She nods and smiles as he surveys the salon.",
    "846": "Through the passenger side window, he catches sight of the skiptracer slumped groggily against the steering wheel. Suddenly, the side door bursts open and Diana tumbles out, landing deftly on her feet. Blood trickles down from her nose as she quickly embraces him. He casts a fleeting glance backward just in time to see a tractor-trailer smash through their rental car, reducing it to a heap of twisted metal. Sandy remains motionless, his eyes locked on the wreckage before he turns to Diana and nods softly.\n\nLater, Sandy navigates a battered van down a winding dirt road. In a stark contrast, inside an office, Big Chuck sits opposite Marisol and Julian. His smile slowly vanishes as he eyes the surrounding thugs warily. Tension escalates as Julian violently slams Chuck's head onto the desk.\n\nMeanwhile, Diana rummages through the van, her focus sharpening as the temperature gauge climbs ominously. Sandy is forced to pull over as steam begins to escape from the hood. Stepping out, he approaches the steaming engine while Diana secures the unconscious skiptracer with duct tape. She pauses to take a sip of water, her fingers grazing Sandy's chest before her nose brushes against his beard.\n\nSandy lifts the hood, allowing the steam to vent out. His attention shifts to a sign before he moves to open the van door, revealing the skiptracer breathing heavily under his duct tape restraints. In another scene, a state trooper directs traffic past the remains of Sandy's wrecked sedan, as Julian and Marisol drive by, catching snippets of a witness's account.\n\nWalking along a deserted road, Sandy and Diana are deep in conversation via cell phone. He shoots her a meaningful look, prompting her to avert her gaze. As night falls, a pickup truck rolls toward them. Sandy shows her something on his phone, and later, they set up camp, starting a small fire. Their eyes meet; he looks up, and she closes her eyes briefly. Sandy, resigned, shrugs.\n\nSnuggling up behind Sandy as they lie by the fire, Diana suddenly pulls her arm away as a snake begins to slither toward them. It moves closer, and Sandy turns to look at Diana just as the snake sneaks into his pants. In a panic, he jumps up, fumbling to remove his jeans, which he eventually tosses into the nearby woods.\n\nThe drama escalates when another snake lowers itself from a tree, dropping onto Sandy's shoulders. Diana, quick to react, dips a stick into the fire and swings it at the snake as it begins to constrict around Sandy's neck. The snake, fixated on the flame, bites into Sandy's neck. Diana strikes it repeatedly with the stick until Sandy collapses. She then grabs the snake, pulling it off him as he struggles to dislodge its teeth from his flesh. Once freed, Diana throws the snake away and shakes her hands vigorously to rid herself of the feeling.\n\nThe next morning, as a cargo train rumbles past a dilapidated station, Diana applies makeup while Sandy, dressed in dirt-covered khakis, wakes on a bench and reaches for his injured neck. Watching him, Diana smiles warmly. Sandy then rises, walks away, heads to the ticket booth, and after looking back at Diana, begins to pace.",
    "850": "As the tension mounts, a man briefly grips a woman's shoulder before departing, leaving behind a visibly anxious Charlie. Outside, mist envelops the hands of the possessed masses who sway gently under a full moon partially obscured by dark clouds. An eerie presence looms over a nearby diner as Bob and Jeep enter. Inside, Charlie fixates on Michael's approach, while Sandra seizes a baby. The situation escalates when Michael points his gun, just as an unknown object descends towards the diner. Amidst this chaos, Audrey, standing next to Charlie, shakes her head in disbelief as intense white light floods through the diner's entrance, forcefully blowing the door open.\n\nIn a shocking turn, Michael fires his weapon at Sandra, striking her in the head. She recoils sharply, losing her grip on the baby, which Jeep heroically catches by diving forward. The source of the blinding light reveals itself as Gabriel, a formidable figure with towering black wings, who menacingly swings a mace towards the baby. Jeep, clutching the infant, rolls away just in time as the mace smashes into the floor. Bob, reacting quickly, fires at Gabriel, but the bullets are deflected by Gabriel's wings. Gabriel retaliates, slashing Bob's chest and then brutally striking him across the face, sending him crashing into a cooker.\n\nAs Jeep hands the baby to Charlie, Michael passes some keys to Jeep. The trio—Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey—rush to another door and escape into a scene where the possessed, heads bowed, form a path. Jeep, armed with a pistol, leads the group past the motionless figures, their heads still shrouded in mist. Charlie follows closely, cradling the baby, with Audrey trailing behind.\n\nBack in the diner, Gabriel confronts Michael, who subtly shakes his head. As Jeep, Charlie, and Audrey navigate through the possessed, they approach a figure covered by a bag, standing beside a police car. This figure, struggling to breathe, strikes the car's hood with a stick. The group quickly enters the vehicle, and Jeep drives away, keeping a wary eye on the wing mirror.\n\nMeanwhile, Michael approaches Gabriel in the diner, clasping his cheek and staring intently into his eyes. Gabriel's eyes moisten, his lips quiver as if searching for words, and he grasps Michael's hand, looking deeply into his eyes before pushing him away. Michael readies his assault rifle as blades emerge from Gabriel's mace. Gabriel then expands his wings and chest in a formidable display before lunging at Michael, who shoots and dodges out of the way.",
    "852": "As they drive, a sign is passed by the car's occupants. Suddenly, the back window shatters when Gabriel forcefully lands on the roof. He aggressively tears off the interior lights and pounds the roof with his fists. Jeep, reacting quickly, fires shots upward at him. Gabriel loses his footing and falls off, but manages to cling onto the back of the vehicle. Jeep continues to shoot at Gabriel, causing the car to swerve erratically. Amidst the chaos, Gabriel manages to knock Jeep's hand, triggering a flare to ignite inside the car. Struggling to maintain his position, Gabriel holds onto the back window frame. He then violently grabs Audrey's arm and punches her. The confrontation intensifies as Gabriel seizes Jeep's gun arm, prompting Jeep to fiercely fight him off. Meanwhile, Charlie securely holds onto her baby throughout the ordeal. Gabriel escalates the attack by clamping his hand over Jeep's eyes, blinding him temporarily. In a desperate move, Jeep presses the accelerator to the floor, making the car swerve wildly across the road. Audrey, in a bid to help, grabs Gabriel around the throat. The speedometer needle climbs past 90, then surges to 110. In a sudden move, Jeep slams on the brakes, catapulting Gabriel through the front window to tumble onto the road. The car, out of control, veers off the road, hits a hump, and rolls into a ditch, coming to rest upside down. Trapped, Jeep is upside down in his seat with his head pressed against the roof. Charlie manages to extricate herself from the wreckage. Jeep, struggling, eventually frees himself and stands beside Charlie, who supports him with a shake of her head. Together, with Charlie cradling her baby, they begin climbing a steep hill, finding the ascent increasingly difficult as they search for handholds. Jeep momentarily looks up at the sky, only to see Gabriel swooping down from the bright sky, landing just in front of him. With a single, powerful punch, Gabriel knocks Jeep unconscious. Charlie attempts to flee but finds herself at the edge of a cliff. Gabriel turns his attention to her, extending his hand in a menacing gesture. Charlie, clutching her baby, shakes her head in refusal, locking eyes with Gabriel who stares back intensely. Jeep, regaining consciousness, leaps onto Gabriel's back, causing them both to fall over the cliff. They land harshly on the ground below. Gabriel, recovering first, tosses Jeep aside and menacingly draws a knife as he advances. Jeep, on the ground, looks up at the towering figure of Gabriel poised to strike with the knife. Just as Gabriel raises the weapon, Michael descends from the heavens in a brilliant burst of light. Gabriel, momentarily distracted, looks down, then his face twists in anger. He lunges at Michael with the knife, but Michael swiftly counters, hacking at Gabriel with his sword. Gabriel drops the knife and collapses to his knees, blood dripping from Michael's sword. Jeep sits up as Michael approaches Gabriel and places the tip of his sword under Gabriel's chin. Michael stares intently at Gabriel but remains still. With a shake of his head, Michael lowers his sword and steps back. Gabriel rises to his feet, looks down, and then spreads his wings to take flight. Michael turns to Jeep, who gets to his feet, marking the end of their harrowing encounter.",
    "853": "In the gripping narrative that unfolds, a man engages in conversation with Estevez. Suddenly, he drops something, catching the attention of nearby police officers. He stares at the cops and reluctantly complies with their directives. As Estevez approaches to handcuff him, the man swiftly spins Estevez around, using him as a human shield. Nearby, Burton experiences a seizure and convulses violently, his body shaking uncontrollably as he dances on the spot. Amidst this chaos, lights flicker ominously. Burton's eyes are wide and fixed, his face tense with strain, before he shoots Estevez. Reacting quickly, Michael leaps to the ground, swiftly moves over, and discharges two handguns at Burton, ending the threat. Michael then meticulously places his guns into bags and carries them to a police car, number 1127, which he subsequently drives away from the scene. Burton's lifeless body remains sprawled on the sidewalk as the squad car, with its distinctive roof number, drives past buildings, their lights shutting off one by one as it passes.\n\nElsewhere, a young man in his late 20s awakens abruptly, sitting up with a start in a dimly lit room. He surveys his surroundings and reaches to switch on a nearby light. He finds himself seated on a chair with a small television positioned to his left. Emerging from a two-door trailer, he closes the door behind him and begins to walk away in the early morning light, moving past a large gray trailer under two strings of light bulbs. His hands are buried deep in his jacket pockets as he walks, his features illuminated by the green neon lights of a sign. He pauses, then turns back towards the trailer.\n\nInside the trailer, Jeep's pregnant partner, Charlie, whose belly is noticeably swollen, and Jeep himself, wearing a despondent expression, sit on swings facing opposite directions. As they sit, Charlie steals glances at Jeep from the corner of her eye before turning her gaze away. She then stands from the swing, walks behind Jeep, briefly rests her hand on his shoulder in a gesture of connection, and continues on her way back to the trailer. Jeep remains motionless on the swing as Charlie reenters the trailer through its second door.\n\nAt the Paradise Falls diner, Jeep's father, Bob, is seen fiddling with the TV set and playing with a lighter. Bob's chef, a tall, bald African American man, distinguished by a crucifix and dog tags around his neck and a hook in place of his left hand, works nearby. A young woman, scantily clad, leans over the jukebox, attracting the attention of a woman at a table who grunts in disapproval. The woman's male companion turns to look, prompting a reaction from Bob and another diner, Audrey. Meanwhile, Howard turns to speak with his wife, Sandra.\n\nOn a sunny morning, a man in an SUV drives along a deserted freeway, a half-smoked cigarette hanging from his mouth. He is dressed in a brown beanie, a scarf, and a casual jacket. He stubs out his cigarette, picks up his cellphone, and checks it before noticing a sign for Paradise Falls beneath it. Unfolding a map, he studies it carefully before spotting the diner up ahead. He pulls into the forecourt and spots Charlie standing by a phone box, smoking a cigarette.",
    "855": "As the scene unfolds in the diner, Charlie, wearing his name badge, saunters over with a casual stride. Sandra greets him with a smile, though her teeth are gritted, revealing a tension beneath her facade. Suddenly, the door swings open, and Jeep enters, making his way directly to the kitchen.\n\nInside, the focus shifts to a steak left on the counter, now covered in flies. Charlie's smile fades as he notices the unsightly scene, and his expression turns to a glare. All eyes then turn to a dear, sweet old lady in the diner. In a swift motion, Charlie slams the bill onto the table and heads back to the kitchen. Jeep, observing the old lady, begins to approach her. The steak, noted to be rare, is swarming with flies as the old lady cuts into it. Nearby, Audrey grins, seemingly amused by the unfolding events.\n\nChaos erupts as Gladys bites a chunk from Howard's neck, sending him collapsing to the floor. She then tips her table over, escalating the disturbance. In response, Percy grabs a frying pan and hurls it at Gladys, striking her. Gladys, unfazed, straightens up with a gash on her cheek and dark eyes, then charges across the diner. She leaps onto the window blinds, scuttling up them to an inverted V-shaped ceiling before scampering across it.\n\nBob, attempting to intervene, fires a pump-action shotgun, but Gladys swiftly leaps down in front of him, swatting him away. The shotgun falls in front of Jeep, who picks it up as Gladys approaches. Jeep closes his eyes, and Gladys slows to a halt at his feet. Jeep hasn't fired. He looks up to see Kyle holding a smoking pistol.\n\nMeanwhile, Howard lies gasping in a puddle of blood on the floor. Sandra rushes to him, her hands soon covered in his blood. Kyle, after putting his gun in his waistband, joins them and applies a napkin and his scarf to Howard's wound. Audrey, sitting on a bench seat, hugs her knees and shivers as blood drips from the ceiling onto her head. She notices two stains above her.\n\nPercy and Kyle then haul Howard to an SUV, his toes dragging on the ground. They load him into the back with Sandra and Audrey. The SUV reverses and then drives back onto the road, heading toward a dark cloud in the distance that Audrey spots. The cloud resembles spreading smoke. As they drive, a fly enters through a grill, followed by others splattering onto the windscreen, and then thousands storm in through the grill.\n\nBack at the diner, in the men's room, Jeep vomits into a cubicle. Bob, standing by a nearby sink, drinks from a can and sees Jeep's reflection in the mirror. Bob pats Jeep's shoulder comfortingly before turning at the sound of a car, indicating the others' return. He grabs Percy, and they both rush inside as Bob looks up to see a giant storm of flies looming overhead, darkening the sky. Bob quickly retreats inside.\n\nThe gruesome face of old Gladys is uncovered from under a plastic sheet. Bob and Jeep carry her out, accompanied by Kyle, as they watch an approaching police squad car. Kyle then turns to Jeep and Bob, signaling a moment of reflection amidst the chaos.",
    "857": "A tall, gaunt man dressed in a light shirt, dark floppy bow tie, and light trousers steps in front of his van, headlights still illuminating the area. He advances, his movement drawing the attention of Bob, who watches as the ice cream man sniffs the air before opening his mouth. The man's arms stretch out from his sleeves; he then bends and bounds forward like a stick insect. As he leaps, Michael shoots him, continuing to fire until the man hits the ground and stops twitching.\n\nInside the diner, tension is palpable as the women and Jeep appear anxious. From their vantage point on the roof, they turn their heads to spot lights approaching along the road. Two columns of cars, their drivers convulsing and heads shaking violently, bear down on the diner as if on tracks. Bullets strike the lead vehicles, causing them to spin on the road while shells cascade at the feet of the shooters. One car collides with another, flipping over and erupting in flames. The bursts of gunfire briefly light up the faces of those on the roof.\n\nMichael, moving along the walkway, notices more lights from the opposite direction, led by a villain car followed by a truck. He launches a grenade, destroying the lead vehicle, then opens fire on the truck, which spills its load of pipes and crashes into other cars. The surviving vehicles come to a halt, their doors opening to release drivers and passengers who walk calmly towards the diner. From above, the group observes the approaching crowd, their faces impassive. Among them, Kyle spots a young girl in a white party dress holding a balloon, her gaze seemingly fixed on him. There are men, women, and children in the group.\n\nMichael initiates firing again, causing people to fall. Shells drop from the rifles as, inside the diner, Jeep nervously moves a torch around. His father continues to shoot several of the advancing individuals. Michael separates from the other three, while Sandra and Audrey stand near Howard, who lies on the floor. Charlie's attention is drawn to the window above the office desk where someone bursts through, though the intruder remains unseen initially.\n\nCharlie rises from behind the counter as Howard yells, being dragged by the legs by a young-faced female intruder towards the shattered window. The others struggle to hold onto Howard as the woman leaps out, still pulling him. In the chaos, her arm is grabbed, and as she cuts Charlie, a knife slices through his wrist, severing his hand. Michael, now inside, witnesses Howard being pulled out. With an assault rifle in each hand, Michael shoots out of the window.",
    "860": "A man sits quietly, while a woman gazes downward. Jeep's expression shifts from a frown to a hardened look before he turns and walks away. Overwhelmed, Charlie's face contorts as she breaks into sobs. As wisps of clouds drift past the moon, Kyle and Audrey stand on the roof; Audrey, with an assault rifle in hand, eventually sets it down. Kyle looks away, lost in thought, as Audrey shakes her head before breaking into a broad grin. Both then look down contemplatively from their vantage point.\n\nInside the building, additional lights flicker on, and the jukebox begins to hum to life. Back on the roof, Kyle and Audrey survey the dark landscape until their attention is caught by a vehicle speeding along the freeway. Bob emerges from the kitchen, joining Jeep and Charlie at the window to peer through the blinds at the van maneuvering through the cluttered cars in front of the diner.\n\nOn the roof, Kyle gives Audrey a dark look before they both aim their weapons—Kyle with his assault rifle and Audrey with her pistol—as the van stops at the gas pumps. A man exits the vehicle, gesturing to its occupants, while a child inside watches him grab the gas nozzle. The little boy, pressing his hands against the window, looks up at Kyle and Audrey.\n\nSuddenly, Audrey dashes to the edge of the roof for a better view, with Kyle following her gaze. Several cars emerge from the darkness, heading towards the diner. Kyle's focus sharpens on the man at the van, while inside, the boy starts banging on the window. The vehicles converge as the man drops the gas nozzle and attempts to return to the driver's side, but a car swerves into him, sending him flying. The vehicle comes to a halt, and a punky-looking individual steps out, followed by a van from which a chaotic group spills out.\n\nThey surround the van, force it open, and seize the boy. Kyle, shooting at the encroaching group, leaps over the diner's wall and rushes toward the chaos, his gun blazing. Meanwhile, inside, Bob starts tearing away planks from the windows, only to turn and find Michael pointing a gun at him. Amid the turmoil, Kyle reaches the boy, lifting him up and fending off the attackers.\n\nClutching the child close, Kyle faces the advancing crowd, only to meet the boy's gaze and see his black eyes moments before the boy bites him in the neck. Kyle collapses, and inside, Bob kicks over a chair in frustration. Audrey descends from the roof, charging into the fray with her gun firing. She targets the boy but finds herself out of ammunition. Staring at the boy, whose mouth is smeared with blood, Audrey quickly gets into the van and shuts the door as the possessed begin to climb onto the vehicle.\n\nIn the tense aftermath, Charlie turns to face Michael, who simply stares back at her, his expression unreadable.",
    "861": "A French tricolor flag lies submerged beneath the waves. A wooden galleon, tilting heavily to its starboard side, is being dragged through turbulent seas into a dry dock. Lines of men, tugging on thick ropes connected to the ship, stand within the dock. The sea surges into the dock, engulfing the men in the center up to their waists, while others occupy higher positions within the structure. These men, scruffy and unshaven, are prisoners who grunt as they pull the ropes in unison, the rough, chained ropes passing through their hands.\n\nOverseeing them from high above on the quay side stands Javert, a grave-looking man dressed in a blue uniform. His gaze is fixed intently on one particular prisoner, who deliberately avoids eye contact. Once the ship is secured in the dock, the prisoners begin to file out. Javert stops one, the very prisoner he had been watching closely. This tall prisoner, sporting a beard and closely-cropped hair with a slight stoop, turns back to pick up a long, thick flagpole from the ground. He heaves it onto his shoulder after squatting and struggling to his feet. Grimacing under the weight, he lumbers forward while Javert watches with a cold stare. The flag, still attached to the pole, trails through the water until the prisoner reaches Javert and drops the pole. Javert's eyes remain fixed on the prisoner, Valjean, who staggers away from the dry dock.\n\nValjean, using a stout staff, plods across the rocky terrain of a mountain top towards a cross on the summit. As he passes the cross, the sun begins to rise, casting light on the path ahead. He continues his journey up a snow-covered hillside, a solitary figure silhouetted against the skyline. With a satchel over his shoulder, he steps onto a ledge and takes a moment to glance at the mountains ahead. Spotting men at work, he approaches a farmer and removes his woolen hat as the farmer reads some documents. As Valjean departs, a fleshy-jowled town hall officer turns to a guard.\n\nOn the street, children pelt Valjean with stones. Seeking warmth, he holds his hands over a fire inside an inn. Suddenly, Valjean is attacked outside, enduring punches and kicks. He wanders into a churchyard and lies down near the church, where he is startled awake by a cleric, a bishop, holding a lamp. Frowning, Valjean finds himself crouching by a blazing fire, then seated at a table where he ravenously shovels down food. He pauses to look at the bishop and two women standing nearby. Rising, he watches as one of the women places silverware into a cupboard. Lying in a bed later, he stares at an ornate ceiling before getting up to approach the cupboard. As the bishop sleeps, Valjean stealthily stuffs silverware into his satchel.",
    "863": "In the grim atmosphere of a slum at night, a smartly-dressed man approaches Fantine, removing his hat before forcefully grabbing her dress and pressing himself against her. Fantine resists, scratching his face, but he shoves her away as Javert, the inspector, arrives on the scene. Recognizing Valjean nearby, Fantine turns her back to him, breathing rapidly in distress before spitting in his face, causing him to recoil. Javert signals to one of his men to hold back, then lifts Fantine into his arms as they depart, with Javert observing their exit.\n\nLater, Javert is handed a letter which he opens and reads while standing in the snow. After a brief glance upward, he crumples the letter. Facing Valjean, whose brow is furrowed as he rises from his seat, Javert appears puzzled. He then gives a curt bow and leaves, with Valjean watching him go before leaning on his desk. In a subsequent scene, Valjean kneels at an altar in church, packs money and papers into a case, and takes a carriage to court where he is escorted out by a court usher under the watchful eyes of onlookers.\n\nAt the hospital, a nurse attends to Fantine, who lies semiconscious on her back. The nurse uses a cloth to dab Fantine's forehead before exiting the room. Valjean enters, and as he does, an image of a nine-year-old blonde girl appears and then vanishes. Fantine's condition deteriorates; she becomes still, her head lolling to one side. Valjean gently closes her lifeless eyes and bends forward to kiss her on the temple.\n\nThe tension escalates when Javert draws his sword. Valjean, having fended off Javert with a baton torn from the wall, is disarmed but quickly turns, rushes out of the door, and dives into the river below. Javert runs out in pursuit but finds no trace of Valjean. Meanwhile, Fantine lies peacefully in her hospital bed.\n\nElsewhere, at an inn, young and grubby Cosette gazes enviously at children playing in the snow, her glare intense. The innkeeper, Thenardier, rises and moves among his discreet patrons, offering a drink to a staggering man and taking his reading glasses. His wife, mingling with the clientele, musses a soldier's jacket and gazes admiringly at a handsome man. The scene shifts to outside where a silver-haired gentleman sits alone on a crate by a mule.",
    "864": "In a dark forest, young Cosette, resembling an urchin, carries a bucket when she spots Valjean approaching. Startled, she drops the bucket and rushes to conceal herself behind a tree, observing him with fear. The moonlight softly illuminates her youthful face. Her expression brightens upon recognizing him; she then takes his arm as he picks up the bucket filled with water and they walk through the town. Madame Thenardier intercepts them, taking the bucket away. Thenardier, with open arms, gestures to Cosette, who shakes her head in refusal and stays put despite his beckoning. Madame Thenardier reacts with a gasp. Valjean retrieves his hat, previously snatched by Thenardier, and takes Cosette away, presenting her with a doll before carrying her off.\n\nInside an inn, the scene shifts as Javert arrives on horseback and then departs. Madame Thenardier forcefully shoves her husband, who attempts a kiss only to be pushed away. Meanwhile, Valjean and Cosette travel through the night in a carriage, with Cosette asleep, her head on Valjean's lap. He gently strokes her hair as moonlight filters through the trees. Valjean fondly gazes at the sleeping girl until he spots Javert. Quickly, he hides the doll inside his coat. They exit the carriage and escape hand in hand along the city wall. Javert, on horseback, sees them and gives chase along a colonnade. Valjean climbs over a stone balustrade, lifting Cosette to safety, leaving Javert unable to follow, forcing him to turn back.\n\nValjean then uses a rope hanging from a building to descend, while Javert, now on foot, searches through dark alleyways. Valjean climbs atop a wall with Cosette watching fearfully as he struggles. Using the rope, he pulls her up beside him, and they remain still on the wall top as Javert passes below and eventually leaves. Valjean then lowers Cosette down the other side of the wall with the rope and follows her down, carrying her onward. They come across a chapel, its interior bathed in the warm glow of candlelight, where nuns are singing. As Valjean, holding Cosette, turns, he notices a stout, scruffy balding man who discards his spade and removes his hat. They depart with this man, Fauchelevant.\n\nHigh on a tower, Javert stands before an ornate cross, closes a Bible, and steps out onto a ledge overlooking Paris, a huge stone eagle beside him and the tower soaring to a spire topped with a cross. In the wasteland where the Bastille once stood, a giant elephant, originally a model for Napoleon's planned monument, now stands neglected and decaying. A scruffy, ratty-haired urchin emerges from a hole in the elephant's head.",
    "865": "In the heart of Paris, a group of mischievous urchins emerges from an elephant statue, skillfully sliding down ropes. They dash across a desolate wasteland and burst into a bustling restaurant, snatching food amidst the chaos. Nearby, beggars extend their hands in silent plea towards affluent Parisians. Amidst the crowd, the first urchin approaches a well-dressed couple seated in a carriage.\n\nGavroche, agile and daring, leaps from carriage top to carriage top before disappearing into the crowd. Soon, he is seen perched on the back of a moving carriage, traversing the city streets. Young students begin to mingle with the beggars and urchins, some taking a stand on a platform. As police on horseback approach, the students distribute leaflets to the gathered crowd.\n\nAn elderly gentleman, identified as the white-headed man, heads towards his carriage. Nearby, his grandson Marius, along with others, raises his fist defiantly into the air. Later, in the solitude of his attic room, Marius removes a gold ring from his finger and retrieves a pistol from a case. A beautiful young woman, Eponine, the daughter of the Thenardiers, stands at the doorway, watching him thoughtfully as he steps out onto the street.\n\nMarius pauses to allow a carriage to pass but is soon distracted by a scene across the street where Valjean is handing money to a beggar. Accompanying him is Cosette, a stunning young woman with flowing blonde hair. She notices Marius watching her, visibly captivated. Cosette also gives a coin to the beggar and, catching Marius's eye, offers a smile as she departs with Valjean. Eponine, witnessing the exchange, looks on with a tinge of sadness.\n\nThenardier, lurking near a dilapidated hovel, spots Valjean and Cosette and approaches them. But before he can reach them, they flee. Thenardier, undeterred, grovels and dusts off Javert's jacket, who in turn scrutinizes him carefully. As this unfolds, Marius approaches and, spotting Cosette as she walks away, he grabs her arm and smiles.\n\nInside a dimly lit tavern, the students gather for a meeting. Marius sits, lost in his thoughts, drawing a frown from Enjolras. Spotting Eponine, Marius rushes over to her, but she leaves. He exchanges a glance with Enjolras and follows her out.\n\nMeanwhile, in her cozy bedroom, Cosette is joined by Valjean who enters carrying a candle. Noticing a scar on his wrist, Cosette looks visibly affected and soon walks out of the front door, leaving Valjean knitting his fingers together in reflection.\n\nUnder the cover of night, Marius finds himself on a dark street, pursued by Eponine. From the shadows, he peers through the railings into Valjean's garden. Cosette approaches him, walking past branches heavy with blossom, her gaze fixed on him. After a moment, she heads back to the house, and Marius, after lingering, departs. Inside, Cosette follows Valjean. As Marius walks away, he spots Cosette's handkerchief on the ground, picks it up, and continues on his path. Eponine, her spirits low, melts into the shadows.\n\nThenardier, accompanied by his accomplice Babet, walks down the street. He confronts Eponine and delivers a harsh slap. Meanwhile, Cosette, appearing desperate, receives a candlestick from Valjean which she places in her bag. She then seals a letter with wax, rushes to the garden, and slips it through the railings. Eponine, ever watchful, emerges from the shadows and retrieves the letter.",
    "866": "Eponine receives a letter directed to Marius, which she opens and reads, her expression turning distressed. Amidst heavy rainfall that drenches the cobbled streets, she walks slowly, completely soaked, through the darkness. Meanwhile, the Place de la Bastille is lined with student protesters and townspeople. Inside the elephant, Gavroche and other urchins gather. A procession of soldiers marches down the street, followed by cavalry, with a large black hearse for General Lamarque trailing behind them.\n\nEnjolras, waving a red flag, climbs onto the street, soon joined by Marius and others. Javert observes from within the crowd. Tensions rise as the cavalry confront the protesters amassed around the hearse; Enjolras and Marius ready their pistols, while soldiers raise swords and aim muskets. A shot rings out from a soldier, striking a woman who collapses. The cavalry charge forward, initiating a fierce exchange of gunfire between the men and the soldiers. Enjolras fires his weapon, and amid the chaos, one student, Courfeyrac, is knocked down. Javert, disguised in civilian clothing, assists him back to his feet.\n\nMarius rides down the street as the construction of a barricade begins; a cart is overturned and furniture is hurled from windows. A cannon is maneuvered into position, and students start shooting from behind the newly formed barricade. The cavalry is pursued down the street by armed citizens as protesters scatter through the streets. Amid the turmoil, Marius encounters a couple in an intimate moment, his face lighting up with excitement. Courfeyrac's voice rings out, adding to the chaos, as more tables and even pianos are thrown from windows.\n\nInside a cafe, Javert covertly takes a rosette, pinning it onto his dark jacket. Additional items like a couch and another cart are added to the barricade, further blocking the street. An old woman is kissed, her chair taken for the cause. Javert also acquires a pistol, and a red flag is tossed to Marius. Climbing atop the barricade, Enjolras waves the flag vigorously, while people from the surrounding buildings wave tricolors in solidarity.\n\nJavert makes a return, prompting everyone to raise their weapons. In a burst of action, he manages to throw off the men restraining him and lands several punches, though the students eventually overpower him. Enjolras decisively knocks him out with a club. Both Enjolras and Marius, showing concern, scan their surroundings, then grab their weapons and lead their group back to the barricade. A woman nearby closes her shutters, as the students take their positions at the barricade, aiming their weapons.\n\nA platoon of soldiers advances up the street to confront them. The light flickers across Enjolras's determined face, and the street is illuminated by sparking gunpowder. The students return fire as soldiers attempt to scale the barricade, with more shots being fired through it. A soldier lies dead atop the barricade. Marius, seizing a barrel of gunpowder that suddenly ignites, is called out to by Gavroche. Behind the barricade, Eponine steps into view just as a soldier aims at Marius. She grabs the musket, sacrificing herself as she is shot. Marius, holding a torch, begins to lower it towards the flaming gunpowder. An officer, noticing the imminent danger, turns to his men, who quickly retreat. Enjolras, breathless, takes the torch from Marius's hand, ready to continue the fight.",
    "867": "Eponine, wounded from a gunshot, sits hunched over, clutching her chest. Marius squats beside her, wrapping an arm around her comfortingly. Raindrops glisten on her pale face as her eyes close. With her last bit of strength, she reaches out to touch Marius's face, gazing at him, before her hand drops lifelessly to her side. Young Gavroche, tearfully watching nearby, is moved by the scene. Marius tenderly kisses Eponine's brow, while Enjolras, grave-faced, also observes. Enjolras then squats down to help Marius carry Eponine away from the scene.\n\nOverwhelmed with emotion, Marius stares at a letter from Cosette, his eyes filled with tears. Clutching the letter, he approaches Gavroche, who quickly ascends a dark stairway to deliver it to Valjean and Cosette's lodgings. Gavroche hesitates for a moment before continuing his journey. Valjean, upon receiving the letter, reads it with a deepening frown. He then gazes up at the sky, lost in thought, and surveys his surroundings.\n\nOutside, Valjean stealthily takes a dead soldier's jacket, a peaked cap, and a musket, disguising himself as a soldier. He makes his way to a barricade manned by watchful students. Upon removing his cap, he is permitted entry, though met with guns pointed at him. Inside, Javert stands with a noose around his neck. Valjean looks up, then shoots a soldier off a nearby rooftop. Gavroche hands Valjean a pistol. Beaten and bloodied, Javert, with his hands tied and the noose still around his neck, stares blankly at Valjean. Valjean pulls Javert's head up to meet his gaze, and they lock eyes for a moment. Then, Valjean drags Javert to his feet and leads him to a dark corner, where he holds up a dagger. Facing each other, Valjean cuts the ropes binding Javert's wrists. Javert, incredulous, walks away, turns back briefly, and then continues off into the darkness. Valjean aims his pistol at Javert, walks towards him, and then fires into a wall, prompting Javert to stop, look back, and then leave.\n\nReturning to the group, Valjean is met with serious expressions. He nods as Enjolras addresses everyone. Marius, who had been adjusting the barricade, sits with the others as wine is passed around. Frowning, Valjean listens to Marius, who is clutching Cosette's handkerchief. Standing nearby, Valjean wears a fraught and serious expression as he leans in a doorway and watches Marius. Later, Valjean stands beside the sleeping Marius, who looks fearfully at Enjolras as everyone around them appears thoughtful.\n\nTragedy strikes as a soldier shoots at Gavroche, who had climbed through the barricade. Gavroche is hit, shot again, and falls dead on his back. One of the students retrieves Gavroche's body and carries it back behind the barricade, with Marius providing cover with his musket. An army officer observes the scene. Behind the barricade, Gavroche's body is laid on the ground as Enjolras, looking heavy-hearted, surveys the situation. As cannons are rolled forward, the students manage to shoot down a few soldiers.",
    "870": "In the early morning, a beam of light emanating from a lighthouse sweeps gracefully across the shimmering blue expanse of the ocean. Nearby, Kate Armstrong, a woman in her late 30s with striking brunette hair, raises her eyebrows thoughtfully. She then ties a dazzling white chef's apron around her waist in the tidy kitchen of her restaurant, preparing for the day ahead. She checks the orders pinned to a shelf before stepping into the walk-in fridge, where she leans wearily against a rack.\n\nIn the restaurant, Kate engages in a warm conversation with a middle-aged couple, Mr. and Mrs. Peterson, who soon depart. She then shakes hands with another couple, Ken and his wife, before making her way back through the bustling restaurant. In the kitchen, she addresses her busy chefs, who continue their tasks diligently. Holding two plates of food, Kate turns, her lips pursed in contemplation of their response.\n\nAs night falls, snow gently descends on Kate as she walks along a New York street. Her long hair, which had been neatly tied up in a bun, now flows freely under a black beret. She enters her modest apartment, dropping her keys into a bowl on a cabinet and placing some mail beside it. She checks her phone messages before drifting off to sleep. The next morning at half past four, she blearily reaches out to silence her alarm clock.\n\nLater, Kate visits a fish market, and back at home, she dons a blue apron over her black top and jeans to cook. Her cooking is interrupted by the phone, which she hurries to answer. Leaving her apartment, she descends a flight of stairs, briefly turns back upon seeing a neighbor, Sean, and then continues downstairs as he enters his apartment. She then retraces her steps up the curving staircase, unlocks her door, pauses briefly beside it, and then closes it again.\n\nAt her therapist's office, Kate garnishes a plate of food and watches as he begins to eat. She turns away, seemingly lost in thought. Back at the restaurant, the atmosphere is lively but chaotic as a waitress, Bernadette, collides with a colleague, causing a bottle to be handed to pregnant Leah. Kate, hearing the phone, reluctantly approaches it and turns away from the kitchen's noise as she listens, her eyes filling with tears.\n\nOvercome with emotion, Kate rushes down a hospital corridor and stops at the reception desk to speak with a nurse, who directs her to a room opposite. Entering the room, she finds her young niece, Zoe, lying in bed with her eyes closed, bearing grazes above and below her right eye. Kate circles the bed, her gaze filled with sadness. A balding doctor in his 40s, Dr. Barton, stands in the doorway, offers a comforting pat on Kate's shoulder, and then leaves. Kate stares out the window at the sleeping Zoe, later falling asleep herself in a chair beside her niece's bed.",
    "874": "Kate gradually awakens, absorbing her surroundings before her gaze shifts to Zoe, who stares back at her intently. Aunt and niece share a prolonged, silent exchange. Eventually, Kate sits up, her eyes fixed unwaveringly on the young girl. Tears begin to stream down Zoe's cheeks as Kate nods with a heavy heart. Zoe's face, contorted in anguish, reflects her deep sorrow, while a single tear trickles down Kate's face. Exhausted, Kate enters her apartment, removes her long, red scarf, and approaches the answer machine. Standing transfixed in the hallway, she clutches her coat before turning and moving back toward the door.\n\nAt the restaurant, all eyes turn to watch Kate as she walks in and past them. Paula sets her wineglass down. In the empty kitchen, Kate ties her apron around her waist and then walks away, ignoring Paula. Leah, concerned, observes Kate, who appears distracted and teary-eyed. Inside the walk-in fridge, Kate crouches on the floor, reading Christine's letter. Through a window in the door, Paula watches her. Distraught, Kate looks up as Paula enters, nods with a quivering chin, and Paula gently takes hold of Kate's hands.\n\nIn Zoe's hospital room, Kate enters and walks to the end of Zoe's bed, placing her bag on the over-bed table. She then moves the bag to a chair by the window, sets her handbag beside it, and removes her coat and scarf while speaking to Zoe. Zoe, turning away, resumes watching a Bugs Bunny cartoon. Kate sits in the chair beside the bed. Zoe gives a faint nod and refocuses on the TV.\n\nA yellow taxicab travels along a New York street, with Zoe in the back seat, her gaze lost through the rain-splashed window. The cab stops, and Zoe and Kate exit. Zoe, with a red rucksack slung over her shoulder, looks up at Kate's apartment building, a smart brownstone with a broad set of steps leading to an arched entranceway. Inside, Kate gives Zoe a tour of the apartment, walking down a hallway. Zoe slowly enters her new bedroom, which is light and airy, featuring a large bay window with a seat and a spacious double bed.\n\nAt a cemetery high on a hill overlooking the city, Zoe stares morosely at her mother's casket by the graveside. As other mourners start to leave, Zoe turns to Kate, and the two walk away together slowly. A large, lifelike cuddly toy giraffe is carried up the steps of Kate's brownstone, followed by more toys and a bike being brought inside. Zoe carries a stuffed elephant, and a collection of cuddly toys is arranged around her new room.",
    "876": "A photograph album opens to reveal a snapshot of Christine holding baby Zoe. Another page shows Christine beaming beside a birthday cake. Further on, there's a picture of Zoe clutching a teddy bear, followed by an image of Christine and Kate, arms entwined, smiling broadly for the camera. The album concludes with recent shots of Zoe. Kate gently closes the album and sets it atop the chest of drawers, then dims the lamp and moves slowly around the bed to sit on its edge, her gaze drifting downward in wistful reflection.\n\nThe following morning, Zoe stands by the bed, watching her mother Kate sleep. As Kate's eyes flutter open, she glances at the clock, still groggy. Meanwhile, Zoe is in her room, fixating on Kate with a steady stare. Kate, exhaling a resigned sigh, begins to rummage through a cardboard box in Zoe's room. She pulls out a scarf, which Zoe dismisses with a headshake. Kate searches further, unearthing another, met with the same gesture from Zoe. Returning the pink, stripy scarf to the box, Kate moves on to sift through a second container. Zoe follows her into the hallway where Kate grabs her keys and coat. As Kate heads to the door, Zoe lingers, staring at it. Kate returns to her, noting Zoe's nod and subsequent averted gaze.\n\nWith Zoe now adorned in a red woolen hat and a multicolored scarf, they leave the house. Kate returns momentarily with coffee. They walk down the street and pause by a yellow school bus parked outside a large, brown brick building. Inside the school, they navigate a corridor adorned with children's artwork. Ellen takes Zoe's hand and leads her away as Kate, elsewhere, lies incredulously on her therapist's couch.\n\nAs the school day ends, a group of children rush down the steps of Zoe's school. Kate, waiting with other parents and guardians, breaks into a smile upon seeing Zoe emerge independently. Together, they stroll down the street and back home where Zoe sits at the table, and Kate brings over her plate.\n\nSuddenly, Kate hurries to answer the front door, where she encounters a teenager sporting a nose piercing and a goth style. Kate sizes her up before turning to see Zoe pass by, then back to the visitor, Charlotte, whom she greets with an awkward smile. Charlotte steps into the apartment, and Kate closes the door, then proceeds toward Zoe's room, where they exchange a meaningful glance.\n\nLater, at a restaurant, in the kitchen, Leah and Nick are busy as Kate walks by and turns off the CD player. Nick glances up, slightly taken aback, as Kate shows a hint of irritation. The restaurant staff gather around a table where Nick serves spaghetti, and a plate is passed to Kate. Nick, with his handsome, shaggy hair, looks at her, a little disconcerted by the earlier interaction.",
    "877": "At a dinner gathering, Nick exchanges a meaningful glance with Paula before carrying a plate of spaghetti to Kate, who is engrossed in a crossword puzzle at the table's far end. As he sets the dish in front of her, Kate tucks her pencil into her neat bun and begins to eat. Meanwhile, Leah and Bernadette observe the interaction while enjoying their own meal. Kate looks up at Nick with a petulant expression, then glares at him as he returns to Paula. Frustrated, Kate stands abruptly and storms out of the room.\n\nIn her office, Kate vents her anger by slicing a menu in half before returning to her paperwork. Later, in the bustling kitchen, Kate approaches Nick, who offers her a taste of his cooking from a pan. Using her own spoon, Kate samples the dish but quickly walks away. Nick tastes the sauce himself and seems pleased, then stirs another pan and smiles while chatting with Leah. Kate notices their conversation and disapprovingly looks over at them. Leah throws her head back and laughs.\n\nNick catches Kate's eye and offers her another taste from a different pan, but she dismissively shakes her head and leaves. The kitchen showcases an array of desserts on pristine white plates, including a chocolate pudding garnished with raspberries, a chocolate teardrop topped with cream, and a flawless fruit tart. Kate uses a blowtorch to caramelize a fourth dessert, then nearly collides with Nick as she turns from her workspace. Nick places a plate on the worktop and picks up a bottle of dessert sauce, while Kate grabs another bottle and begins decorating her plate. She briefly glances at him before delicately placing a spun-sugar cage over a white chocolate mousse on a bed of strawberries. Nick watches closely, making Kate uneasy, and she accidentally breaks the cage. She then picks up the dessert plate along with another sugar cage and moves to the other side of the worktop. Nick contemplates her as she walks away.\n\nIn the walk-in fridge, Bernadette hurries out, leaving Kate leaning wearily against a shelving unit. As Nick enters and approaches her, Kate looks away. Nick removes his apron, and they exit the fridge together. Kate then turns to Leah, who looks at her pleadingly. With a cool gaze at Nick, Kate activates her blowtorch. As Nick walks past her, Kate, distracted, holds the blowtorch at her side. A tea towel tucked into her apron catches fire, but she quickly throws it to the floor and extinguishes the flames by stamping on them.",
    "880": "In a quiet moment, Zoe lies on her bed, facing away from her aunt Kate. Suddenly, Zoe turns and sits up slightly, prompting a silent exchange of stares between the aunt and niece. Kate's gaze drops to the floor, and she turns to exit the room, offering a faint smile as she does so.\n\nThe scene shifts to a bustling restaurant where Zoe meticulously peels asparagus spears. Nearby on her chopping board, three black truffles await their use. Kate approaches, setting down a plate beside Zoe, and delicately grates a small portion of one truffle over a roast quail before handing the dish off to a colleague. Zoe, meanwhile, discards the asparagus trimmings into a bin. She then picks up a truffle, sniffs it with disdain, and tosses it, along with the others, into the bin. Upon her return with another plate, Kate notices the missing truffles in the bin, retrieves them, and places them into a yellow lockbox containing additional truffles, all under Zoe's bemused watch. Nearby, Nick, smiling to himself, chats with Zoe while chopping onions. Zoe, equipped with a large stainless steel bowl, kneels before a box of potatoes, as Nick selects a couple to show her. As Zoe fills the bowls with potatoes and carries them away, Nick continues his conversation on the phone in the office. Later, Nick extends a spoonful of sauce to Zoe, who tastes it and nods in approval.\n\nThe mood lightens as Zoe teaches Nick some dance moves, both energetically punching the air and pointing. Back in the restaurant, Nick serves pasta to the eagerly awaiting staff. In another instance, Zoe hands a plate to Kate, who attempts to pass it on but is rebuffed by her already occupied colleague, prompting Kate to reluctantly accept the plate back from Zoe. Zoe's gaze fixes on Kate before she taps her shoulder and extends the plate again. Kate, somewhat hesitantly, takes it and starts eating, eventually nodding and smiling warmly at Nick.\n\nIn a serene park, Zoe, who had been walking along the benches beside Kate, halts and leans in to whisper something in Kate's ear. Zoe then jumps down and walks ahead. The restaurant setting resumes as Nick enters the kitchen, tying on his white apron. Later, Kate pulls back a curtain to observe Zoe pacing on the wintry street below their apartment. Smiling, Kate heads downstairs. Back inside, Zoe stands on a stool in the bathroom, braiding her hair, before rushing to the apartment door, swinging it open, and dashing downstairs. Nick, meanwhile, inspects Kate's cupboards, and Kate retrieves a box from his bag. In the kitchen, Zoe ushers Kate out as Nick demonstrates to Zoe the art of crafting a pizza base.",
    "882": "In the opening scene, a lady's hand meticulously crafts a piece of floral embroidery. Transitioning to the outdoors, two horses gallop energetically across the picturesque English countryside. Their riders, pausing at a vantage point, gaze upon a spacious mansion nestled amidst distant trees. With a beaming smile, Mr. Bingley spurs his horse onward towards his new estate, closely followed by a more reserved Mr. Darcy.\n\nObserving from a distance, the thundering horses catch the eye of a young woman, Elizabeth Bennet. Up on a hillside, Elizabeth turns away from the scene, a playful smile gracing her lips. Dressed in a straw bonnet and a simple day dress, she then sets off down a country lane, absorbing the verdant surroundings before accelerating into a canter. Having gathered a bouquet of wildflowers from the woods, she traverses a small field where a chestnut mare and her foal graze leisurely under the sun. Continuing her journey, Elizabeth heads towards the nearby village.\n\nAs she nears her home, Longbourn, the sound of her sisters arguing inside causes her to bypass the entrance. Peering into her father's study, Elizabeth shares a knowing smile and eye roll with her father. In another part of the house, Lydia playfully dons Kitty's bonnet, prompting Kitty to dash out of the room in tears, passing Jane in the hallway. Outside the local church, Mrs. Bennet engages in a deep conversation with a neighbor. Her five daughters begin to trail behind their father, prompting Mrs. Bennet to hastily join them.\n\nBack at Longbourn, Mr. Bennet strides into the house, placing his hat and cane aside, while a maid rushes to attend to Mrs. Bennet. Elizabeth and Jane exchange amused smiles, and Lydia rolls her eyes at the commotion. Later that evening, Jane sits at her dressing table, brushing her long, flaxen hair by candlelight, with a wistful Elizabeth seated behind her. Elizabeth affectionately kisses Jane on the head before leaving the room and closing her bedroom door.\n\nDownstairs, Mr. Bennet works late into the night in his study, meticulously reviewing household accounts. After marking entries in a book and replacing his quill, he shakes his head wearily and leans back in his chair. With a mischievous glance, he reaches for a decanter of liquor. Meanwhile, upstairs, Elizabeth leans on her dressing table, examining her reflection and practicing various facial expressions before extinguishing her candle and retiring for the night.\n\nThe scene shifts to the bustling main street where a grand carriage, escorted by torch-bearing men, pulls up outside The Assembly Rooms. A servant opens the door and extends the steps. Mr. Bingley steps out first, his smile wide as he surveys his surroundings and dons a large Napoleonic-style hat. A more somber Mr. Darcy follows, with Miss Bingley, adorned in a grand ball gown and feather hat, stepping out last.",
    "885": "As the evening unfolds at the dance, Mr. Hurst arrives, adding to the gathering. Inside the hall, Fitzwilliam Darcy surveys the building with a noticeable detachment. The atmosphere inside is vibrant; men and women clad in pastel gowns, smiles on their faces, hold hands and twirl in a joyous circle. From the sidelines, an older man, Sir William Lucas, enthusiastically claps along to the music.\n\nAmidst the crowd, Lizzie and Lydia, adorned in their empire-line dresses, revel in the festivities. They gracefully perform the dance steps, setting to their partners with dainty movements, executing a do-si-do before rejoining the circle. The dancers then shift into a two-line formation facing the chamber musicians, where the ladies and gentlemen engage with their partners before gliding across the floor in a spectacular display of color and feathers.\n\nThe arrival of the Bingley party is announced by an awestruck silence that sweeps over the room. The new guests appear visibly uncomfortable until Sir William Lucas hastens to greet them warmly. As dancing resumes, Lizzie joins her sisters Jane and Mary, who are conversing with Sir William's daughter, Charlotte. The two younger Bennet sisters then move to stand by their mother, and the ladies offer a respectful curtsy. However, Darcy, with a brusque bow, departs the scene, much to Mrs. Bennet's chagrin.\n\nJane exchanges a quick look with her mother before focusing her attention back on Bingley. Later, she is seen dancing with him, their hands clasped as they share warm smiles. Meanwhile, Darcy watches from the side, his disdain unmistakable. His gaze then shifts to Mrs. Bennet, who is presiding over a group enjoying tea and cake, openly expressing her contempt for him. Continuing his survey of the room, Darcy notices Kitty and Lydia causing a ruckus as they dash through the hall.\n\nOutside, the local men, in high spirits, mimic the dancing inside on the dark street. One man, caught up in the fervor, trips and tumbles into a water trough. Back inside, as Jane and Bingley conclude their dance, Bingley gently takes Jane's hand to introduce her to his sisters. Mrs. Bennet watches with a satisfied smile. The couple soon takes to the dance floor again, Bingley looking dashing in a dark tailcoat and pale satin breeches, while Jane is elegant in her creamy gold dress with puff sleeves and long white evening gloves. Bingley, with his noble features and fair, curly hair, moves with practiced ease and grace on the dance floor.\n\nDarcy continues his somber patrol through the hall, his expression one of grim forbearance. Sir William approaches him but then decides against speaking. Nearby, Lizzie sits with the more serious Mary. Bingley, showing a touch of nervousness, allows Jane to lead him over to meet Charlotte Lucas. As another dance commences, Lizzie overhears Bingley's conversation and feels a surge of irritation. Bingley then departs, and Lizzie, having caught the exchange, casts a sidelong glance at Darcy. With a mischievous smile playing on her lips, she rises and deliberately crosses the room in front of him.",
    "887": "Lizzie sits attentively by Jane's bedside, tenderly caressing her sleeping sister's face. As Jane's eyes flutter open, she weakly gazes at Lizzie, who responds with an encouraging smile. The scene shifts to the dining room where Miss Bingley's cheerfulness wanes, and she strides across the room. Lizzie is then ushered into the room amidst the chaos of two spaniels startling pheasants from a bush outside. From Jane's bedroom window, Lizzie observes the ongoing shooting party, then turns her attention back to her sister, who manages a weak smile. Lizzie, moved to tears, returns the smile.\n\nAs the twilight sets in, the hunting party makes its way back to Netherfield Hall. Lizzie, now facing away from a mirror, is adorned in a white silk gown. Sharing a heartfelt moment, the sisters exchange smiles. Lizzie proceeds down a staircase, her movements tinged with uncertainty. Startled by a footman, she manages a grateful smile before nervously scanning her surroundings, unsure of the drawing room's location. Her search leads her into a dimly lit corridor and eventually into the billiard room where Darcy, playing alone, acknowledges her presence with a swift bow. Lizzie, momentarily frozen in the doorway, quickly retreats. Darcy watches her departure with a pensive look before resuming his game.\n\nIn the drawing room, Lizzie immerses herself in a book. Darcy, after a brief glance at an ongoing card game, approaches her and takes a seat at a nearby desk, prompting raised eyebrows among the onlookers. As Darcy becomes aware of being addressed, Lizzie smiles. Their eyes lock in a thoughtful exchange.\n\nThe scene transitions to Mrs. Bennet being conveyed in a carriage, with Lydia and Kitty eagerly leaning out to view the imposing red brick facade of Netherfield Hall. They are then welcomed inside, while Darcy exits the scene. Mr. Bingley shoots a stern look at his giggling sisters. Lizzie, overwhelmed, closes her eyes in embarrassment.\n\nDarcy is seen taking a bath in a copper tub, where a servant pours water over him. Shaking water from his hair, Darcy relaxes against the bath's end. Meanwhile, Lizzie strolls through the estate grounds, pausing to smile at a proud gray and white Great Dane. As the dog dashes away, she joyfully pursues it. Darcy, freshly out of his bath and dressed in a robe provided by a servant, moves to the window where he observes Lizzie playfully wrestling a stick from the dog's mouth, intently watching her every move.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts as Mr. Hurst sleeps soundly in a chair, with Mrs. Hurst seated beside him.",

Lydia and Kitty, filled with excitement, rush back to their family home, Longbourn, bursting through the front door.\n\nJane gently places down her embroidery as Lizzie slumps wearily into an opposite chair. The housekeeper enters, delivering a letter to Jane before curtsying and exiting the room. Outside, workers are seen carrying trunks and boxes out of Netherfield.\n\nWrapped in cloaks and bonnets, Kitty, Lydia, and Lizzie navigate through the bustling town. Denny escorts Lydia, while Carter leads Kitty away, leaving Wickham to exchange hopeful smiles with Lizzie. She responds with a beaming smile, and they continue their stroll through the town together.\n\nLater, Mrs. Bennet steps out of Longbourn, deeply engaged in conversation with Denny. As the three sisters trail behind their mother and the officers, Lizzie shares a smile with Wickham. He acknowledges Mrs. Bennet with a polite nod before he and the other officers depart.

Concerned, Lizzie moves to sit next to Jane, offering her a comforting smile.\n\nA carriage, drawn by four white horses, arrives at Longbourn's drive. Mrs. Bennet rushes out, followed by Mr. Bennet and their daughters, to greet the portly gentleman Edward Gardiner and his wife stepping out of the carriage.\n\nCharlotte Lucas enters the scene, followed by Jane.

    "895": "A balding undercover officer initiates contact by knocking on the cellblock door. Inside his cell, the notorious gang leader, Dillinger, leisurely flips through a magazine before glancing up. The officer ushers in Purvis, who sports a crisp suit, into the cellblock while other lawmen keep a keen watch from a side table. Dillinger, upon noticing Purvis, sets his magazine aside, rises, and saunters towards the bars of his cell. Both men scrutinize each other intensely; Dillinger tilts his head in curiosity, while Purvis maintains a calm gaze. The tension is palpable as other officers and agents observe intently. Dillinger's eyes scan the stoic G-man from head to toe, and he shakes his head, his brow furrowed. Purvis, with a furtive blink, cracks a faint smile. Dillinger straightens to his full height, offering a cocky smile while chewing gum. As Purvis prepares to depart, he pauses, turns to face Dillinger once more, his clean-shaven face outlined by sunlight. Dillinger watches Purvis from within his cell as both men walk away, hands tucked into their pockets. Purvis inspects Dillinger with barely a break in his stride before exiting with his agents, leaving the balding officer behind. Dillinger continues chewing his gum thoughtfully.\n\nMeanwhile, a three-propeller plane with a curved, boxy underbelly and thick wings cruises the sky, its chevron-shaped windshield positioned behind the nose, and six windows serving as skylights over the cockpit. The plane later descends towards a rainy airfield. On board, Dillinger is jostled in his seat as the plane lands and taxis past distant hangars. Near one hangar, a man ignites a flare, raising it to signal a vast crowd. Two journalists capture the moment on movie cameras, one showing a police officer awaiting Dillinger's arrival. Additional journalists with flashbulb cameras and three lawmen armed with rifles are also present, the flare's light catching a gleam. The plane comes to a stop, and lawmen exit a nearby car as another flare is launched. Amidst whipping winds, two trench-coated lawmen escort the shackled Dillinger across the tarmac, his button-down shirt and open vest visible, his wet bangs hanging over his face. Flashbulbs pop as Dillinger, pushed forward by his armed escorts, stumbles toward a Sedan adorned with a sleek bird-winged hood ornament. A jerky handheld camera view shows a gunman joining Dillinger in the back seat. Two policemen stand on the running boards of the car as it begins to move, accompanied by officers on motorbikes. Inside, Dillinger slouches, his head bobbing, his gaze pensive and directed downward, as passing lights reflect off the car's polished black hood.",

Inside the vehicle, a large escapee in the backseat fixates on a red traffic light, his chest heaving with anticipation. Nearby, Dillinger, his head slightly bowed, moistens his lips nervously before subtly reaching for a gun tucked into his waistband. As soon as the traffic light turns green, Dillinger shifts the car into gear and navigates it onto a new street, occasionally checking his surroundings by glancing over his shoulder. The escapee, now alert, also looks back. With a sly smirk, Dillinger shifts gears again, propelling the Ford away from the town as Youngblood vigilantly monitors their rear through the back windshield. The car soon cruises alongside a serene field.\n\nDillinger shares a light-hearted moment, shaking his head at a bewildered mechanic who mimics the gesture. Simultaneously, during an interview elsewhere, Hoover listens attentively to the broadcast, momentarily pinching the bridge of his nose in concentration.\n\nIn the privacy of her apartment, Billie sits anxiously in a chair, her hands fidgeting. Overcome by urgency, she rushes to the telephone, leaning against a wall as she presses the receiver to her ear. At the telephone exchange, Baum listens intently to the conversation. Billie, overwhelmed by despondency, clutches the phone, her eyes lowering in sad resignation. In a tender moment, Dillinger, standing in a phone booth, wears a faint smile. Billie, deeply affected, removes the receiver from her ear and holds it to her neck, resting her chin on her knuckles.\n\nOutside Billie's apartment, two men discreetly watch from a car hidden beneath a bridge. Later, Purvis sits in a car outside the same apartment, where Baum joins him, handing over a file containing a transcript of Dillinger's recent call to Billie. Behind them, an el train smoothly crosses a bridge, its interior lights illuminating the night.\n\nIn another scene, a tan car stops, and Dillinger and Red step out. As Dillinger proceeds down an icy walkway around a corner, Sport emerges from a nearby safe house. Red positions himself on the car's side, gun raised, while Marty appears from the house behind Sport. Dillinger, assessing the situation, narrows his eyes and tilts his head before drawing his machinegun. Inside the safe house, a man stands by the doorway, ready with his weapon, while outside, Red keeps his gun trained on the house.\n\nLater, Dillinger and Red forcefully enter a cigar shop, where Red quickly seizes two customers. Behind one of the counters, Gilbert stands, receiving a stern look from Dillinger. Gilbert then leads them upstairs to a dimly lit room filled with chalkboard-covered walls and rows of men busily talking on telephones. Overhead, small green-lampshaded lights hang next to clusters of dangling phone wires. D'Andrea, perched on the corner of a desk, exchanges a glance with Gilbert. A blonde man inside the room signals for Dillinger to raise his arms, to which Dillinger complies by lifting his hands.",
    "899": "As tension escalates, Dillinger seizes the blonde man in a chokehold, menacingly pointing a gun at Gilbert. Nearby, D'Andrea observes Gilbert, whose hand hovers over his own firearm. D'Andrea then shifts his attention to Dillinger and Red. In a swift move, Dillinger releases the blonde man with a toss and secures his weapon back into its holster. Thoughtfully knitting his brows, Dillinger locks eyes with D'Andrea, who responds with a nonchalant shrug. A scowl forms on Dillinger's face as he glares at D'Andrea. The mustached gangster inches closer while Dillinger, tilting his head and narrowing his eyes, again meets D'Andrea's gaze before turning away. Eventually, Dillinger and Red make their exit.\n\nElsewhere, Hoover and Purvis proceed down a corridor. Outside, Hoover parts from Purvis to greet a group of well-dressed boys lined up, engaging them with handshakes. Hoover then faces the media. Simultaneously, in a cinema, these events are broadcasted on a newsreel. Here, Dillinger is seen conversing with a rugged gangster before nodding to Shouse. As Dillinger's image flashes on screen, he discreetly shields his face. Shouse attempts to stand, but Red forcefully pulls him back down. Nervously, Homer averts his gaze. Dillinger, visibly worried and with his face tilted downward, is bathed in light as the overhead fixture turns on, illuminating the audience members. The crowd briefly looks to the right, then refocuses forward as the lights dim and a new film begins. Nearby, Tommy engages Dillinger, who rubs his lips contemplatively before nodding. Exchanging a look with Red, they stand up, collecting their coats. A few rows in front, Homer dons his hat and steps into the aisle behind them. As they leave the theater, Red draws near to Dillinger.\n\nIn a bustling town square, people wander amid a stiff wind that ripples the awnings of nearby stores. On the opposite side, a policeman arrives on a motorcycle. Inside a bank, Baby Face, standing on a table, shoots through a window towards the officer and then fires at the ceiling. Outside, Homer seizes a man, using him as a hostage. Within the bank, Dillinger and Tommy share a look of exasperation. From a vault, Dillinger tosses a bag to Tommy and guides the bank president by the shoulder, soon joined by a woman. The gangsters use hostages as shields while exiting the bank, passing Homer who stands guard by their car with his hostage. Baby Face unleashes a barrage of gunfire into the square, causing two men to dive for cover. From a window across the street, a man takes aim with a gun. Reacting swiftly, Dillinger lurches forward, eyes wide, and drops to a seated position, his weapon still raised. He then spots Tommy, who lies fatally wounded in a pool of blood on the ground.",
    "902": "In the midst of a violent confrontation, a man with two bullet holes in his head slumps, lifeless, in a chair. Stunned, Purvis opens a rear door and witnesses the chaotic clash between the G-men and gangsters. Amidst the skirmish, Homer dashes across the barroom to a distant window, while John hurries down the stairs, clutching two Tommy guns. He hands one to Baby Face, and together they position themselves at the barroom windows. Suddenly, liquor bottles on the barroom wall shatter explosively.\n\nUpstairs, Red and Johnny take cover from the shattered windows before resuming their attack. Agent Winstead fires his shots, causing chips to fly from the wall above a guest room mirror. From behind a disabled car, Purvis unleashes a barrage, peppering the plaster walls of Dillinger's room. We find ourselves crouching alongside the gangsters in the second-story guest room, our view shifting jerkily from right to Dillinger. Outside, FBI gunfire riddles a balcony, and through an adjacent window, a gangster can be seen taking aim. The G-men continue their assault, and Agent Rice is shot in the leg.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Red provides covering fire, enabling Dillinger to rush into a neighboring guest room and smash a window with his gun. Together, Dillinger and Red make their escape onto a rooftop and leap down into a dark yard on the other side of the launch. Back in the barroom, a jerky close-up follows Baby Face as he backs up to a side door. Outside, he emerges and opens fire toward the car. His shots kick up clouds of dirt, but Purvis responds, firing through the dust, his bullets splintering the door. Inside, Baby Face dashes past Homer and leaps through a bay window, escaping as Agent Pleg spots him fleeing.\n\nPurvis locks eyes with Baum, who then sets off. As Purvis shoots at the side door, Homer returns fire. Baum races past Agents Clegg and Madala in pursuit of the fugitive. Meanwhile, Dillinger and Red continue their escape through the woods, unnoticed by Winstead, who spots them. Winstead and his partner set out in pursuit, following the duo as they race along a forested hillside. Red, carrying a cloth sack, stays close behind Dillinger as they hurry past a narrowed outcropping. Winstead and Hurt appear on the trail, and as Dillinger and Red pass a misty overlook, the agents reach a stand of twin trees and split up, with Hurt taking to higher ground while Winstead advances on the trail. Through the leafy canopy, the criminals can be seen scurrying away.\n\nWinstead tosses his hat aside, sights Dillinger, and fires. Dillinger retaliates, but as Winstead rolls to avoid the gunfire, Dillinger's weapon runs dry. Winstead kneels and resumes firing, forcing Red and Dillinger to take cover behind trees. Winstead's shots strike the trunk shielding Dillinger, who calmly reloads, his breath misting in the cold, night air before he leans out and returns fire.",
    "903": "Dillinger scans the hillside, finding no trace of anyone. Meanwhile, Red cautiously peers over Dillinger's shoulder from his vantage point in a tree. Dillinger, feeling the tension ease, lowers his weapon. The two men then set off together.\n\nHidden behind a tree, Winstead remains low, observing their departure. In a dramatic slow-motion scene, the criminals sprint along a misty overlook with Red in the lead. Suddenly, Agent Hurt opens fire from a higher position on the hill. Red is hit and falls, but Dillinger quickly helps him to his feet, and they continue their escape. Winstead, not far behind, resumes tracking them.\n\nDillinger confronts an unsuspecting man outside a cabin. Later, Red, wounded and clutching his side, is assisted into a stolen car by Dillinger, who opens the door for him. Meanwhile, Baby Face Nelson reaches an unpaved road. Baum, approaching in a vehicle, peers intently over the steering wheel. As the car's headlights grow brighter, Baby Face turns his back to it, casually waving a hand while stepping backward and keeping his Tommy gun concealed under his coat. Baum stops the car and exits from the passenger side, only to be immediately thrown down by Baby Face. The fugitive then tosses Baum's Tommy gun onto the front seat, takes the driver's seat, and drives off.\n\nPurvis, running through the forest, soon comes upon the scene where his partner Baum lies fallen. He removes his hat and kneels beside his dying colleague, watching as the car carrying Baby Face drives steadily away. Purvis then moves out in pursuit, with Agent Madala following but pausing upon spotting Baum's body.\n\nOn the dirt road, Purvis takes aim at an approaching car, holding his handgun loosely and raising a hand in signal—it's Cowley's team. Cowley executes a sharp 180-degree turn, and Purvis positions himself on the running board of their vehicle, armed with a Tommy gun.\n\nBaby Face encounters Homer and Shouse, who are aiming their guns at a Ford. As Cowley's car takes a tight turn, Purvis, scowling into the night, continues the chase around another curve. Their headlights briefly illuminate a dip in the road and then the stolen Ford climbing a rise ahead. Purvis opens fire, and Homer responds in kind. Baby Face swerves to dodge the incoming bullets. From Cowley's car, now closing the gap, Purvis continues shooting relentlessly. Homer reloads during a brief respite, while a curve in the road gives Purvis a better angle, allowing him to hit the Ford's hood. The Ford veers off into a field, rolling over twice before coming to rest on its tires. Inside, Shouse's lifeless face presses against the cracked windshield.\n\nHomer abandons Baby Face, who is trapped behind the jammed front door. With a forceful kick, Baby Face manages to free himself. Purvis arrives and unleashes a barrage of bullets at Homer, whose chest erupts in red bursts as he falls. Attempting to escape, Baby Face shoots and hits Cowley. Purvis takes aim with his pistol, but Agent Madala is quicker, firing a shotgun at Baby Face. Purvis then follows up with his own shots. The paunchy gangster collapses. Baby Face, half-recovering, struggles to his knees and fires his Tommy gun one last time.",
    "915": "Alvin nods in agreement and walks away. Pete and Homer, exuding confidence, swagger off. Dillinger leans in close to Red, engaging him in conversation. Meanwhile, Red's attention is drawn to a brunette in a red dress as she makes her way back to her table. Anna guides a young woman over to Red. As Red and Veronica stroll away, Anna follows them, leaving Dillinger by himself. Dillinger fixates on the brunette in the red dress, who responds with laughter and a radiant smile. The gang leader, sipping his drink, rises from his seat, his gaze firmly fixed on the exotic woman. He moves decisively through the crowd, stops right behind her, and leans onto her chair. She looks up at him, and he shakes his head in stunned disbelief. Her bright red lips curve into a coy smile. She exchanges a grin with the other women at her table before leaving with Dillinger, who cautiously locks eyes with her before looking away.\n\nBillie leads the way to the dance floor, where Dillinger takes her hand while she places her other hand on his shoulder. They sway together, Billie smiling softly. Dillinger gazes off shyly but soon finds himself captivated by her lovely face. Billie stares back with defiance, her dark eyes probing his as they move to the music. A faint smile graces her lips, and Dillinger, summoning a breath, raises his eyebrows. Her smile widens.\n\nOn stage, the songstress surveys the crowded dance floor. Later, Billie and Dillinger walk through the club's foyer, with Billie wrapping her crimson jacket tightly around her body. Stepping outside, she winces against the wind. Dillinger turns her to face him and drapes his overcoat over her shoulders. She gives a bashful grin and continues down the sidewalk, wrapped in his jacket and arm.\n\nIn an elegant restaurant, Billie uneasily surveys her surroundings before her eyes meet Dillinger's. She smiles but then notices a snobbish female diner who scrutinizes her, causing Billie's smile to briefly falter. Dillinger flashes an amused smile and leans back. He then diverts his attention to another table. Their eyes lock once again, and under Billie's thick, dark eyelashes and graceful nose, a faint smile plays on her lips. Dillinger stands to help her up, holding her chair before guiding her out of the restaurant with a gentle hand on her back. They arrive at the coat check counter.\n\nAt a bar, a stocky man with slicked-back hair notices them. Dillinger glances at the man over his shoulder and leans toward Billie before stepping away. Billie, irritated, shifts her gaze, glares at him, and forcefully pulls on her coat before storming out. The two men exchange a handshake.\n\nNitti, a lean man with dark, slick hair and a handlebar mustache, slouches as he eats. A short, husky man with olive skin and a toothbrush mustache approaches Dillinger. They shake hands before D'Andrea leaves.",
    "916": "Dillinger exchanges glances with Gilbert before forcefully pushing through a revolving door. Emerging outside, he encounters only a well-dressed couple and a uniformed doorman. With a frown, the gang leader surveys the sidewalk and then turns to confront the doorman. His expression remains one of dissatisfaction.\n\nThe scene shifts to a gleaming hood ornament of an archer on Purvis' Pierce Arrow. Inside an FBI field office, a chubby agent displays a jacket. Purvis, pacing, then turns to address his gathered task force. He briefly faces a secretary before gazing out a window at a neighboring high rise, then turns back to his men. One of the agents momentarily lowers his eyes. In a telephone exchange with Baum, Purvis plays a 78 record as night falls.\n\nDillinger strides past a brightly lit city park and later marches through a crowded lobby with vaulted arches. He locates Billie working behind a hatcheck counter. As a male guest extends his coat towards Billie, she notices Dillinger. Swiftly, Dillinger smacks the back of the bystander's head, causing the man to double over. With deft motion, the crime boss flips open the counter's pass-through, steps into Billie's work area, and forcefully grabs the man's wrist, yanking it over the counter. He then snatches the man's claim ticket, retrieves his coat, and tosses it back at its owner while Billie watches. Dillinger then retrieves Billie's coat, holding it open for her. With a coy smirk, she steps from behind the counter, her gaze briefly meeting a staring co-worker's, and slips into the coat.\n\nIn an apartment, a hand drops a rabbit's foot key chain beside a tabletop sculpture of two racing greyhounds. Dillinger leads Billie down a hall into a lavish living room. As she surveys the space, he positions a chair near a sofa and looks at her. Billie joins him, removing her coat. Dillinger places a plain cardboard box on the coffee table. Billie, complying, looks around with a subtle smile. Behind her, Red appears in his undershirt, leaning through an open interior window. He collects a couple of glasses from a counter and then casually walks off with two women. Sitting across from Billie, Dillinger places his hand on the large box, which she eyes coolly. He smiles subtly and shifts boyishly in his seat. Billie lifts the lid to reveal forest green tissue paper covering the contents. Gently unfolding the layers, she discovers a camel-haired coat with a thick fur collar. Lifting the gift from its box, she stares at it, swallows, and then raises her tender gaze to meet Dillinger's. Her full lips curl into a smile, and the crime boss grins back. They lock eyes, filled with warmth.\n\nLater, on a bed, they passionately kiss each other. Silhouetted against a window, Billie leans over the reclined Dillinger, her bobbed hair brushing his brow.",
    "919": "The movie opens with the iconic Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer logo, where a lion's head emerges from a crest encircled by a film garland. This is followed by a dramatic scene where light flares intensely from a torch held by a robed woman standing on a pedestal against a backdrop of towering clouds.\n\nThe action shifts to a breathtaking landscape where towering crags emerge majestically from a shimmering sea. The pace quickens as two sleek cars race through a coastal tunnel. The camera focuses on a shiny wheel spinning rapidly and the intense gaze of a driver focused on the road ahead.\n\nSuddenly, a gun is snatched, and the driver quickly glances into his rearview mirror. He accelerates his gleaming Aston Martin past a line of traffic, skillfully evading pursuers who begin shooting. Bullet holes riddle the Aston's windows, escalating the tension. A truck's tire bursts and it swerves directly into the path of the Aston Martin, sliding dangerously along the wall. James Bond, the determined driver of the Aston, brakes sharply to avoid collision.\n\nA piece of metal from the front of the truck strikes the car's door, causing it to lock with the truck. Bond brakes again, forcefully, which tears the door off his Aston, sending it spinning chaotically down the road. Regaining control, Bond speeds away. The road ahead is blocked in both lanes, and as one vehicle barrels toward him, Bond expertly maneuvers into a narrow gap. His pursuers, less fortunate, crash head-on into the truck.\n\nUndeterred, another Alfa Romeo continues the chase. As Bond approaches a traffic jam, he swerves left into another tunnel, narrowly escaping the pursuers' sight. The chase leads them toward a quarry, with both the Aston Martin and the pursuing black Alfa Romeo speeding over a bridge, observed by police in a Land Rover with flashing blue lights.\n\nExiting the tunnel and rounding a corner, Bond skids to avoid the police Land Rover blocking his path. He speeds through the dusty quarry, the Alfa still in hot pursuit. Bond navigates around tracked excavators and down a bumpy track facing a newly carved quarry face. The police open fire but are met with gunfire from the Alfa. The Land Rover crashes into a building and off a cliff.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Bond calmly shifts gears. His eyes widen in shock as the Land Rover reappears, bouncing dangerously close on the track ahead. A gunman from the Alfa leans out, firing as Bond ducks to avoid the shattering glass and bullets. The Alfa pulls alongside, and both cars scrape each other, dust flying from their paintwork. Suddenly, a bulldozer looms in their path, and both vehicles swerve around it.\n\nIn a decisive move, Bond grabs a machine gun. The Alfa, unable to keep up, hurtles off a precipice. Bond drives his now dusty and battered Aston Martin into a medieval Italian town, navigating through its narrow streets surrounded by stone buildings. The chase concludes under the shadow of a lofty campanile bell tower that stands prominently over the town's huddled structures.",
    "923": "As the wooden gates swing open, James Bond proceeds down a long, straight brick tunnel. He pauses, exits his vehicle, and opens the boot to reveal a man blinking up at him. In a dramatic moment, Bond is spotlighted in a pool of light, raising his pistol and firing a bullet in super slow motion, surrounded by a burst of smoke. The bullet travels, creating a smoky trail over sand dunes, while light envelops the sun. A shadowy Bond aims his weapon as his silhouette crosses the sandy landscape.\n\nA red dot moves laterally across the scene. Amidst this, a naked woman appears silhouetted by the sand, lying over the dunes in the dim light. Bond stands in the low light as fine sands flow like liquid around him, from which a woman's naked body emerges. Bond turns, gun in hand, as a gloom-shaped hood of lights surrounds the scene. The naked woman stands in silhouette as Bond falls into billowing sand. Sand and stars swirl in the grim light, the grid flexing and moving against the starry darkness.\n\nA crowd of naked women poses in silhouette around the glaring sun, forming circles that animate into a flickering blur before dissolving and floating through space. Sand swirls in the light as high-heels pose, slowly turning. Bond falls towards the expanding crowd of people in the eye of the scene. Sand engulfs a pistol as Bond falls in slow motion onto the sandy ground. He raises his pistol and fires in super slow-motion, the bullet spinning slowly as it flies. A red dot travels sideways again as the sun flares behind a pile of naked women. The bullet lands in an explosion of sand.\n\nA red and yellow checked flag billows in the breeze as a procession of people in bright costumes parades around a square, watched by huge crowds. Bond unceremoniously dumps the man from the boot onto a chair in a cellar, observed by M and another agent. Bond takes a gulp of whiskey as near-tired horsemen enter the square, which is laid out as a racetrack. A chair scrapes across a stone floor as Bond sits next to Mr. White, joined by M.\n\nTension escalates as Mitchell drops one agent, and as M falls, the horse race starts. Bond leaps onto the man, seizing the gun. The prisoner is hit and falls. Bond disarms Mitchell, kicking the gun away, only to be booted to the ground himself. Mitchell grabs the gun and flees. The fast and furious Palio horse race thunders around Siena's main square. Mitchell races down spiral stairs, splashing into water at the base of a tower, and dives through an iron gate. Ignoring the stairs, Bond takes a flying leap in pursuit. In the race, a rider falls. Bond chases his man down a watery tunnel, but his path is barred by a gate.",
    "924": "The thrilling chase begins when the protagonist suddenly shifts his path, diving into an intense underground pursuit that mirrors the fervor of the race happening above ground. Amid this chaos, Mitchell crashes through structural supports, triggering the roof to begin collapsing onto Bond. As the race concludes, fireworks burst into the sky, celebrating the winner, while the track becomes overrun by invaders. Enthusiastic cheers fill the air, accompanied by tears and jubilation, as Bond emerges dramatically from a manhole.\n\nPushing through the dense crowd, Mitchell forcefully makes his way forward, with Bond hot on his trail. In a desperate move, Mitchell shoots at Bond, tragically striking a woman in the crowd before clambering over a barrier and onto the racetrack. Bond, undeterred, sprints after him. Their chase leads them through a courtyard, through a door, and up the stairs.\n\nIn his haste, Mitchell collides with an elderly woman, who is hoisting a crate of fruit with a rope. The impact causes the crate to crash to the ground. Undaunted, Mitchell leaps across the tiled rooftops, with Bond in relentless pursuit. Mitchell attempts a daring jump between buildings, followed closely by Bond. As a round strikes near Bond, causing a brief pause, he leaps, slides down the tiles, and jumps again, landing heavily on a ledge, all while trying to keep Mitchell in sight, who is now on a higher roof across from him.\n\nDetermined, Bond leaps down onto a balcony, then to another, using the metal railings to hoist himself up. Bursting into a room, he traverses through an apartment, spotting Mitchell climbing onto another nearby roof. Bond then jumps from a window onto a bus roof, quickly regaining his footing to leap to another ledge and slide down a drainpipe, his face set in grim determination as he finds himself on the same roof as Mitchell.\n\nThe chase leads them to an empty tower, where Mitchell reaches the top and leaps for a flight of steps, recently dislodged. Bond follows, firing at the fleeing double agent, who disappears from sight. Inside the tower, Bond pulls on bell ropes before ascending to the belfry, his gun at the ready. Suddenly, Mitchell launches an attack from a perch outside the tower. In the ensuing struggle, Bond grabs Mitchell's arm and strikes him with an elbow, resulting in both men crashing through a glass roof onto a scaffold below. Bond's gun falls to the floor far beneath them.\n\nHanging by one hand, Bond tries to destabilize the scaffolding beneath Mitchell, who falls but manages to grab onto a rope. The swinging rope dislodges a pane of glass, which shatters, sending sharp shards cascading down. Simultaneously, the rope gantry swings, causing a crate of bricks at the other end to fall. Both men grab ropes, ending up facing each other, dangling at opposite ends of a steel gantry. Exchanging blows, they smash into a scaffold, which topples, pulling on the rope and hauling them back into the glass roof. Mitchell falls onto the scaffold, while Bond, with his leg caught in a rope, plummets but is halted just before hitting the ground near his fallen gun.",
    "925": "The gantry rotates, pulling James Bond away from a gun and dislodging Mitchell from the scaffold. Mitchell lands on a nearby scaffold tower while Bond yanks at the rope entwined around his leg. Mitchell then scrambles up to grab a gun positioned on the scaffold, while Bond reaches for another gun on the ground. Both men quickly snatch up their respective weapons, and Bond promptly fires.\n\nAs the Town Square's crowds begin to scatter, a police car navigates through the throng. Covered in dust, Bond strides confidently through the dispersing crowds toward a wooden gate within a tunnel. In the cellar, blood stains the floor, but the prisoner, Mr. White, has vanished. Bond surveys the scene with a dispassionate gaze. Rain starts to fall.\n\nA black Range Rover pulls up to a high-rise apartment block. From one of its balconies, M gazes outward. Bond steps out of the Range Rover and enters the building through its glass door. Ignoring the stoic guard, he proceeds into an apartment, passing by masked forensic officers to join M on the balcony. A technical expert opens a door for M, prompting Bond to narrow his eyes in scrutiny.\n\nWearing sunglasses, Bond rides in the back of a taxi down a dusty street. He exits the taxi across from the faded sign and entrance of the Hotel Dessalines. Dressed in a dark polo shirt and light trousers, he enters the building and navigates the drab-tiled lobby, which is cluttered with washing lines. He proceeds down plain concrete corridors to a door, positioning himself to one side. Using a tool, he picks the lock and cautiously enters, peering around into a plainly furnished, empty living room. After closing the door, Bond moves further into the apartment.\n\nSuddenly, a switch-blade snaps open, and a man bursts through glass doors, swinging the blade erratically. Bond forcefully throws him through the glass into the bedroom. Recovering, the man swings the blade again, but Bond counters with a phone. As the man falls, he grabs a pair of scissors. Bond slams him into a wall, suffers a head-butt, and retaliates by hitting him with a book. Bond parries the knife attacks and seizes the man's knife-wielding hand in a painful, finger-breaking grip. Their struggle takes them through a window onto a balcony, where Bond grabs the man by the throat. With calculated precision, Bond stabs the man in the neck and thigh with the scissors. Unfazed by the man's agonizing death and the pool of blood forming beneath his head, Bond proceeds to search the rooms. He takes a shirt from a wardrobe, tears it to fashion a bandage for a cut on his arm, shrugs on a fresh shirt, and wipes blood from his nose. Barely acknowledging the body, Bond grabs the door keys and heads downstairs. With a grim expression, he turns to the young black woman at the reception.",
    "927": "Bond revs the engine and accelerates rapidly. As he speeds away, the general gestures commandingly and roars orders as an inflatable boat quickly pursues Bond. Amidst the chase, the general's men start firing while Bond and Camille struggle to maintain control. Their boat suddenly ramps and swerves, tilting precariously to the side. Regaining control, Bond maneuvers the boat as they narrowly avoid a barrage of bullets. They fix their gaze directly ahead at the pursuing inflatable.\n\nCamille, with precision, uses a boat hook to neutralize a gunman before the inflatable veers for another attack. The swerving boats cause towering sprays of water to erupt around them. Bond, undeterred, plows through additional boats as their pursuers signal frantically to each other, coordinating a dual-boat assault. He heads directly at the two inflatables, crashing between them and sending men tumbling into the water. A gunman struggles with his weapon, but Bond rams an engine, causing a dramatic explosion. Seizing the wheel, Bond navigates as another boat closes the gap between them.\n\nThe chase leads them into a tightly packed marina. Bond slows down, only for the pursuing boat to smash into them with such force that it mounts their stern, knocking Camille down. With the boats entangled, Bond swiftly grabs a grappling hook and throws it into the inflatable. The rope unrolls and tightens, forcefully propelling the inflatable away. In the calm waters, Bond turns the boat around and departs the scene with minimal backward attention.\n\nCamille lies unconscious in the boat's bottom as Bond navigates away from a serene inlet flanked by tree-covered highlands, heading towards a bustling jetty near a complex of popular white buildings. He docks the boat at the jetty, carries Camille through a throng of senior tourists, and leaves her with a bewildered staff member. Continuing on foot, Bond passes by luxury sailing yachts being maneuvered on trailers. He checks a GPS tracker on his phone, then approaches an unattended 4x4 with its door ajar. After surveying the surroundings, he slips into the driver's seat and drives through dilapidated suburbs, placing a call to his sleek, glass-partitioned headquarters. Meanwhile, an agent heads toward M's office.\n\nElsewhere, two black 4x4s pull up at an airfield. Dominic Greene and his security detail exit the vehicle. Greene boards an executive jet, accompanied by a black agent sporting a beard. As the plane ascends, a thin German stirs sugar into his coffee just as turbulence strikes, coinciding with Greene's return from a brief restroom visit. The black agent glares at him, while Greene remains impassive. His colleague offers a chilling smile, then displays a photo of Bond on his camera. The device is tossed to the sullen agent who scrutinizes the image before closing the phone and returning it. Tension simmers as he locks eyes with his colleague.\n\nThe jet eventually taxis to a hangar. Greene exits into a waiting car, glancing up at the CIA agents with a smug grin. Felix responds with a bitter smile before following Beam up the plane's steps.",
    "928": "Greene's car rolls into town, navigating through the tranquil, cobbled streets lined with a gently bubbling fountain. Following closely behind, Bond tracks his GPS, leading him on a pursuit. Their journey concludes at a sleek, modern leisure complex where Greene and his German associate, both donned in tuxedos, step out. Simultaneously, a riverboat docks nearby, disgorging crowds clad in evening attire who mingle in the foyer.\n\nAscending the stairs, Greene enters a bustling space where a colossal glitter ball and various equipment are maneuvered on trolleys, alongside a poster heralding the opera Tosca. A man traverses the staging area, descending steps to the Kunslerangang, the artists' entrance. Backstage, the atmosphere buzzes with activity; makeup artists meticulously apply cosmetics and adjust costumes, including painting a realistic wound on an actress's forehead.\n\nMeanwhile, Bond strides down a stark white corridor, enters a door, and steps into a unique reception area shaped like a cube, perched above the theater's entrance. In this setting, Greene exudes charm while shaking hands with an older gentleman, though his German companion soon wanders off. In the dressing rooms, performers change, with one muscular actor rummaging through two wardrobes in vain search of his attire.\n\nBond, now also in a tuxedo, blends in with the theatergoers. As he observes from a balcony, Greene and his friend, sipping champagne, engage in conversation with two sophisticated women. White-shirted hostesses distribute gift bags to the guests, a detail Bond does not miss as he follows a recipient into the toilets. Inside, Bond empties the contents of a gift bag into a basin, uncovering a small pin resembling the letter Q and an earpiece, which he equips. Meanwhile, Greene follows suit, comfortably settling into his private box with his gift bag in tow.\n\nAs the audience transitions into the auditorium, the guest Bond followed collapses in the corner. Bond, after emptying the bag, exits the restroom, forcefully removing the door handle to prevent pursuit. On stage, the singer is hoisted up via a decorator's cradle, while backstage, Bond navigates a set featuring a colossal moving eye. Ascending flight after flight of metal stairs, Bond reaches a high gantry, from which he surveys the packed amphitheater below.\n\nGreene, watching from his box, notices men throughout the auditorium rising and exiting. Greene's eyes widen in surprise. From his vantage point, Bond photographs the unfolding scene with his phone. Spotting an intruder, Bond swiftly intercepts and neutralizes him with a punch and a knee before heading back downstairs.\n\nThe speaker for the event is revealed to be Mr. White. On stage, a dungeon lid slams shut dramatically. Upstairs, Greene hastily vacates his box. Bond reemerges near the stage's side, removes his earpiece, and exits mere yards from where Mr. White sits, narrowly avoiding detection.",

Meanwhile, underground railway construction disrupts the tranquility of Baker Street. Dr. John Watson, limping with a cane in his right hand and leading a bulldog with his left, sports a hand-knitted scarf around his neck as he approaches his home. He opens the front door, allowing both himself and his eager dog to enter. The bulldog scampers upstairs, leaving Watson to unfasten its lead.\n\nUpon opening another door, Watson is playfully assaulted by the fronds of a palm tree, prompting a grin. He steps into a room brimming with tropical plants and spots a turkey. His attention then shifts to a motionless Holmes standing by the window. Suddenly, a dart strikes Watson's shoulder, and as he turns, he sees a goat. Sitting by a mannequin resembling Holmes, Watson is hit by another dart. Holmes, wearing a two-colored garment and a brown hood that blends seamlessly with the furniture, removes his hood, prompting a glower from Watson. Holmes then leans over Watson, unveiling four mice before departing.\n\nElsewhere, Holmes sits in the Savoy's restaurant, his back to the entrance. He turns upon hearing a woman's laugh, furrows his brow, and checks his watch, which shows eight minutes past nine. His left eye bears a bruise, and though he is cleaned-up, he remains unshaven. He glances around and tucks his napkin into his shirt front, then coolly sips his tea and stares ahead icily.\n\nA woman, Irene, turns her head to face him and swallows deeply. He turns away from her. Irene rises unsteadily, staggering away while leaning on tables for support.\n\nAs scenes shift, pages turn. Watson, entering another room, opens curtains to reveal his old office, one wall of which is covered with a world map, newspaper articles, photographs, and crisscrossing lines of red ribbon. In another setting, Watson drinks brandy while Holmes consumes formaldehyde. Their dog, Gladstone, keels over but quickly recovers, jumping up and dashing off.\n\nIn a different scene, Holmes, sporting an enormous false beard, and Watson ride in an early model car, drawing curious stares from onlookers. Holmes removes his beard, fixes his gaze on Watson, and they arrive at their destination. Both men exit the vehicle, with Watson shaking his head and kicking one of the car's tires in frustration.\n\nLater, in a bustling nightclub, two girls perform acrobatics on a trapeze, swinging upside down as men around them chat and drink. Holmes and Watson sit at a table where a waitress and a waiter promptly spread a tablecloth. Holmes quickly downs his drink, but the moment escalates when Watson snatches the cigar from Holmes' mouth and marches away.",
    "943": "In a fierce confrontation, Sherlock Holmes is forcibly pulled away and struck with a curtain rail by the Corsac. During their struggle, the Corsac cleverly attaches a line to Holmes' belt. Amidst the chaos, Sim intervenes, kicking the Corsac out of a window. The line connecting them tightens, yanking Holmes towards the same window, until he is pulled backwards through it, landing hard on a sand-laden barge in the canal below.\n\nEmerging from the sand, the Corsac seizes Holmes, but Holmes manages to break free, tumbling to a lower deck. As the Corsac attempts to escape, Holmes forcefully pulls him back using the rope that binds them. Both are then grabbed by onlookers, only to be released moments later. Seizing a club from one of the spectators, Holmes strikes the Corsac in the face, then yanks the rope again, dragging the Corsac down. The resilient Corsac rises once more, cuts the rope, and begins climbing back up towards the window from which they fell. Spotting his ascent, Sim backs away from the window.\n\nEncouraged by a spectator, Holmes swiftly ascends a rope hanging from a block-and-tackle on the building's side. The Corsac re-enters the building just as Watson, in another room, collects his gambling winnings. Suddenly, Holmes bursts through a window, crashing into Watson and scattering money across the floor. Sitting up, Holmes notices the Corsac on a second-floor balcony above Sim, who is running on the floor below. The Corsac jumps down to her level.\n\nHolmes gets up and pursues as a melee breaks out among the gamblers scrambling for the scattered cash. Amidst the scuffle, Watson struggles while Mycroft disengages from his conversation. The Corsac, jumping down some steps, trips Sim, who rolls from the fall and pulls out a knife. He dodges her swing and delivers two punches to her face, preparing to stab her when Holmes kicks him through a door into the canal. Sim rises, clutching her nose, and faces Holmes as a slightly inebriated Dr. Watson arrives and stumbles.\n\nCarruthers watches skeptically. Holmes retrieves Sim's bag and a letter from Rene. The next day, Holmes drives through a narrow road to a village, stopping outside the church. Wearing dark glasses and smoking his long pipe, he turns to see Watson, bruised and beaten, asleep in the passenger seat. Holmes nudges Watson, who stirs but does not wake. Getting out of the car, Holmes circles around and shoves Watson again, yet he remains asleep.",
    "944": "Sherlock Holmes, observing two pipers outside a church, signals them to begin playing. Inside, Dr. John Watson awakens with a look of dismay. Holmes, impatient, starts tugging at the coat Watson had been using as a makeshift blanket. Despite Watson's resistance, Holmes forcefully pulls it away, causing a couple of empty bottles to tumble from the car as Watson clumsily emerges. In an attempt to make Watson presentable, Holmes inadvertently tears off the sleeve of Watson's jacket, which he then tosses back into the vehicle. Watson, eyeing Holmes wearily, receives a nod in return. They shake hands, and Holmes guides a somewhat disheveled Watson towards the church.\n\nAs they approach, the wedding guests are already seated, watching the bride proceed up the aisle. Everyone stands, including Mrs. Hudson, who gently taps a sleeping Holmes on the shoulder to rouse him. He stands up, next to a now tidy Watson. Holmes quickly adjusts Watson's tie and boutonnière. Watson then lifts the bride's veil, revealing her smile that soon turns to concern upon noticing his black eye and battered appearance. She glances at Holmes, who offers a reassuring wink. Watson slips the ring onto his new wife's finger, and they exchange a kiss. Holmes, reflecting, looks down thoughtfully.\n\nLeaving the church, the newlyweds pass under the raised swords of several guardsmen. Holmes, standing by the churchyard's latched gate, claps in solitary approval before disappearing through the gate. He starts his car's engine. Nearby, Moriarty's bearded agent leans against the car, casually rolling a cigarette. The agent steps aside as Holmes drives off, leaving behind a cloud of smoke.\n\nThe scene shifts to Kings College, Cambridge, where Holmes, puffing on his pipe, crosses a quadrangle and enters a building. Inside a room, a gramophone plays as Holmes encounters Moriarty and another man, Matthew. Moriarty, noticing Holmes, continues his work at the desk, signing a book, while Holmes examines a blackboard filled with calculations. Holmes' attention shifts to a book near the blackboard and a dying plant nearby. Moriarty hands the signed asteroid book back to Holmes, and they shake hands. Holmes inspects the signature, and Moriarty rises from his seat.\n\nA flashback reveals Irene, whose tea had been poisoned, and Moriarty showing Holmes her bloodstained handkerchief. Seated at a chessboard, Moriarty picks up the black queen. Holmes, deep in thought, picks up Irene's handkerchief from the board, glares at Moriarty, and then moves to leave. Moriarty, watching Holmes go, returns his focus to the chessboard, moving the black queen.\n\nThe narrative returns to Watson and his wife, Mary, at a station, making their way to a waiting train. Watson notices some soldiers as they prepare to board.",
    "945": "Upon entering their cozy cabin, Watson and Mary discover a bottle of champagne waiting on ice. As Watson briefly observes a woman conversing with the conductor in the corridor, he quickly turns his attention back to Mary. With a warm smile, she hands him the champagne. Outside, the train surges through the night, expelling clouds of steam and smoke from its funnel as it races along the tracks.\n\nInside their compartment, Watson and Mary share a passionate kiss before pulling apart. Just then, a steward enters their space carrying a bottle of wine. As he slides the door shut, the compartment is suddenly plunged into darkness. In the ensuing blackout, the steward menacingly draws a knife and lunges toward Watson, who swiftly grapples with him. Amidst the struggle, Mary retrieves Watson's gun and aims it at the steward's hand. Watson then forcefully opens the exterior compartment door, seizes the steward by the collar, and hurls him off the moving train.\n\nAs calm returns, Mary sits down, and Watson gently takes the gun from her hand. He gestures for silence with a finger to his lips and cautiously opens the door to the corridor. In the corridor, Watson witnesses a woman—who earlier had been trying to use the onboard lavatory at the station—violently punch a couple of soldiers before shooting two others. This woman turns out to be Holmes, poorly disguised.\n\nWhile Watson holds off the soldiers in the corridor, Holmes peers out of the open exterior door. In a daring move, Holmes pushes off from the carriage, leaping out as they cross a bridge. Watson, closing the corridor door, notices that Mary has vanished. He looks out the window and then at Holmes. As Watson and Holmes engage in a struggle, Watson tears off Holmes's blouse, revealing his identity further just as soldiers burst into the compartment, one of them pointing a rifle directly at Watson.\n\nHolmes's mind flashes back to earlier events. Standing outside the lavatory in the corridor, Holmes applies lipstick, catching the conductor's attention as he passes by. Watson watches this exchange. Through a grill, Holmes spies into the next carriage where soldiers are preparing their weapons. Ingeniously, Holmes removes the chain from the cistern and a tap from the basin, using the latter to access a gas valve. He pours phosphorous into a container, opens the gas valve, and exits the bathroom just as the train enters a tunnel. In the tunnel's darkness, Holmes scatters phosphorous dust over one of the soldiers, then stealthily replaces a cartridge in one of the men's bandoliers with his lipstick tube and jams the lipstick case into the muzzle of another soldier's rifle.\n\nBack to the present, when the soldier with the rifle fires, the gun explodes, igniting the phosphorous-dusted clothes of the other soldier. Holmes, thinking ahead, had set a booby-trap on the door. After removing his skirt, Holmes, now bare-chested, climbs out of the compartment and shimmies along the side of the carriage, with Watson in pursuit. They carefully make their way along the exterior of the moving train. Unbeknownst to a soldier entering Watson's compartment, he triggers the booby-trapped grenade, causing chaos.",
    "948": "As the full moon illuminates the sky, the silhouette of a boy pedaling a bicycle, with a plump alien nestled in the handlebar basket, glides past. Meanwhile, a small robot dashes energetically through the tall grass beneath a cloudy sky, only to halt abruptly and blink its lights. Suddenly, \"Bad Robot\" flashes across the scene, followed by a burst of sparks showering within the Lillian Steel Foundry. \n\nThe camera then shifts to a detached house on a snow-covered street, where a police car is parked on the driveway. In the garden, 14-year-old Joe Lamb sits solemnly on a swing, his gaze fixed on a locket he clutches in his hand. Inside the house, a wake is in progress, and Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk observe Joe through the window. Near a buffet table, other boys mingle, while outside, a 1970s yellow American Coupe with a black vinyl roof arrives. Joe, from his vantage point on the swing, watches as a handsome man with long blonde hair, named Lewis, exits the car, adjusts his hair, and proceeds into the house. Shortly after, Joe's father, Jack, a man in his forties with dark hair, forcefully escorts Lewis out and shoves him into the back of the police car. Jack notices Joe's apprehensive look before he climbs into the patrol car and drives away, lights flashing, disappearing up the road. Joe, left behind, snaps shut the locket he's been holding.\n\nThe scene shifts to Lillian Middle School as it closes for the summer holidays, with excited students pouring out. Bicycles are retrieved from the bike rack, and Joe is among them when one of the boys from the wake, Charles, approaches him, causing Joe to look shocked. Their conversation is interrupted by a movie they're watching, where a boy named Martin, playing a detective, confronts Cary, who is dressed as a zombie. During their scuffle, Martin pulls out a gun, but Cary disarms him. In the ensuing struggle, Martin forcefully pushes Cary onto some spikes on a wall, impaling him. Blood trickles from Cary's mouth as Joe and Charles watch in horror. Joe leaves the room, and Mr. and Mrs. Kaznyk exchange a concerned glance.\n\nJoe then cycles across the quiet residential street to his house, where Jack's patrol car is parked on the driveway. Entering his home, Joe moves through the kitchen into the living room, eventually discovering his father, Jack, overcome with grief, crying in the bathroom. Jack, overwhelmed by emotion, shuts the door, leaving Joe visibly shocked.\n\nLater, at Carol's Diner, Jack and Joe sit at a table, eating. Jack hands Joe a leaflet, but Joe appears unconvinced. As Jack takes a sip from a beer bottle, Joe looks at him earnestly before shifting his focus to the pamphlet in his hands.",
    "953": "At 12:02 PM, Joe is engrossed in painting a model monster in his bedroom when Jack, appearing slightly disoriented by a prior comment, ponders his next words. Meanwhile, Joe casually holds a locket in his left hand, which Jack notices. Joe then shifts his focus to a pamphlet depicting muscular boys enjoying a baseball game, while giving Jack a cool, unconvinced look.\n\nOutside, a yellow Coupe arrives for a wake, driven by a teenage blonde girl named Alice. She moodily turns away and shakes her head, then glares at Joe and contemplates her next move. Joe, flashing a grin, offers Alice a piece of candy, his delight evident when she accepts it. However, as she checks him through the rear view mirror, Joe's smile fades.\n\nThe car eventually stops at an isolated railway station where Joe and his friends, gathered on a grassy bank, disembark. Inside the station, Joe attentively applies makeup to Alice, starting by gently sponging it onto her face. Alice ties her hair back for better access. Joe continues dabbing makeup onto her eyelids, pausing momentarily to gaze at her with uncertainty on how to proceed.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts as Cary's fireworks light up the scene, and Alice's eyes brim with unshed tears. Joe, completely captivated by her emotional display, watches intently. Meanwhile, Martin, playing the role of a detective, scrutinizes Alice, who momentarily slips out of character. Moved by the scene, Martin wipes away a tear.\n\nThe tranquility is shattered when Charles suddenly dashes across the station platform to view an approaching train. Panic ensues as the boys scramble to load a camera in preparation for filming the train. Joe and Preston share a smile, but their excitement turns to horror as a pickup truck veers onto the tracks directly in front of the oncoming train. The inevitable collision occurs, knocking over the camera.\n\nThe freight train derails catastrophically, with one of its cars careening through the station, obliterating the building. Electrical explosions erupt, and trucks and carriages are hurled through the air, colliding and exploding. Amidst the chaos, Alice fixates on the derailed train.\n\nThe children frantically flee through the debris as more explosions mushroom around them. A tanker is catapulted into the air, exploding upon impact with the ground. Joe navigates through the flaming wreckage, narrowly avoiding a piece that is flung up and then crashes back down. He spots a warning sign amidst the chaos. As he attempts to escape, a massive explosion erupts from the debris, knocking him down. Rising to his feet, Joe sees a carriage lying on its side, rocked by successive explosions. Clutching the locket tightly in his left hand, he witnesses an explosion that propels a piece of the carriage skyward.",
    "955": "As they cycle along a road, Joe awkwardly looks down. An old yellow Coupe arrives, and Louis emerges from it. Joe and Alice watch him intently as he approaches them, removing his sunglasses. Louis, sporting heavy sideburns, briefly enters a house only to return immediately. Alice follows him inside, leaving Joe looking awkward on the veranda. She soon returns to Joe, who appears surprised and steps towards her.\n\nIn a different setting, Martin films a scene where he shoots zombie Cary while Alice observes. They are filming near a wrecked train visible in the background. Joe takes the camera and sets it up to capture the distant crash site. Above, news crew helicopters hover, observing the filmmakers as they look down at the destruction below. Joe's expression turns troubled.\n\nAt the crash site, Air Force personnel diligently clear strange white cubes, packing them into crates that are loaded onto military lorries. Joe's dad, Jack, is present with Air Force Colonel Nelec, who eventually leaves. Jack, feeling unsatisfied, notices men meticulously crafting a plaster of Paris mold. Later, at the police station, Jack discusses matters with Sheriff Pruitt, who then leaves, leaving Jack looking nonplussed.\n\nThe sheriff drives to a gas station, parking by the pumps before entering the shop. Inside, he finds the clerk, Breen, engrossed with a new Sony Walkman. Unable to get his attention, the sheriff tosses a candy bar at Breen. After paying for his petrol and the candy bar, the sheriff returns outside to refuel his patrol car and opens the candy bar. Odd noises catch his attention, and as he looks around, a pack of dogs dashes across the forecourt. Surprised, the sheriff surveys the area as his patrol car begins to malfunction.\n\nHearing a nearby sound, the sheriff, with his hand on his gun, moves to investigate. Suddenly, a dumpster flies past him, nearly startling him out of his skin. Inside the shop, Breen remains oblivious, his Walkman blocking out all noise. Over his shoulder, the sheriff's car jolts violently. The lights start flickering, prompting Breen to look around and remove his headphones to peer out the window. The flickering persists.\n\nApprehensively, Breen steps outside to see the front of the sheriff's car smashed in from a violent impact. He circles the wrecked patrol car, from which steam rises due to a ruptured radiator. Breen picks up the petrol pump's nozzle from a large pool of gasoline on the ground. Hearing something behind him, he turns around, his face etched with complete terror.",
    "959": "Louis, his face bloodied, struggles to sit up in the driver's seat of his car. Alice, turning around, spots a mysterious creature. Louis checks his rearview mirror before attempting to exit the vehicle. Tumbling out of the passenger door, he dashes back up the street only to trip over Alice's bike.\n\nElsewhere, soldiers observe one of their own wielding a flamethrower. Charles and Joe collect their processed film and cycle past the town's water tower. A vast plume of smoke rises just outside the town, where a vibrating cube is stuck in an indentation on the side of the water tower tank. The footage they picked up, recorded on the night of the crash, reveals nothing but clouds of smoke at first. However, once the smoke clears on screen, it unveils footage of a giant spider-like creature emerging from a carriage. Confused by the sound of a siren, Charles and Joe look around. Joe stops the projector and breaks off the film.\n\nOutside, chaos ensues as both civilians and military personnel rush around. Charles and Joe witness a huge pool of smoke rising above the town. Panicked families load their cars, preparing to evacuate, while troops manage traffic and give out instructions. Charles and Joe ready themselves to board a bus, joining an evacuation convoy led by several military vehicles, which also pass military container lorries carrying white cubes recovered from the crash site. The convoy heads out of town with Charles and Joe aboard one of the buses, ultimately arriving at Greenville Air Force Base. The vehicles line up to enter through the east entrance, and inside, civilians disembark from the buses in a large hangar. Air Force personnel guide them along.\n\nJoe wanders through the hangar in search of Jack and spots Louis lying on a bed in the sick bay area. Approaching him, Joe notices Louis looks relieved. Joe then finds Charles, along with Preston, Martin, and Carrie, and they all meet Donnie at the camera shop. Donnie looks around before an armed guard opens the door and escorts him down a corridor. Seizing the moment, Donnie punches the guard, takes his gun, and dons the guard's uniform. Clutching a rifle, he moves through several offices until he spots a fuel tanker outside. Shooting it, the tanker explodes, distracting the Air Force personnel. Jack, taking advantage of the chaos, steals a Jeep and drives off along an unmetaled track through open fields. He stops near a grain silo, exiting the Jeep, and sees a convoy of vehicles traveling along a nearby road.",
    "962": "David, captivated, watches as Elise gracefully wraps her arms around a male dancer's neck, who then lifts her effortlessly. As they spin, Elise extends her legs with elegance. The dancer gently sets her down before lifting her again by the waist. Two additional dancers join in, each taking Elise's hands while the central dancer lowers and then raises her once more.\n\nSuddenly, Thompson approaches David from behind. Turning, David glares at him intensely, then casts a sidelong look. Despite this, Thompson's focus remains fixed on the dancers. David, frowning slightly, shifts his gaze back to the stage where another dancer tosses Elise into the waiting arms of a partner. She stretches out her limbs as she is spun around. Meanwhile, Thompson steps away, his eyes still locked on the performance. Puzzled, David watches as Thompson pauses at the studio's doorway, still observing the stage. Elise then bends forward, sweeping her legs high into the air. Amidst the performance, Thompson nods subtly as Elise is tossed again, resulting in her falling and grimacing in pain.\n\nReacting quickly, David dashes toward the stage where a dancer quickly scoops up Elise and carries her off the platform. David jogs after them as they exit the studio. Thompson, his face tense, turns away from the commotion and walks through a doorway.\n\nLater, in the back of a cab, Elise rests her head on David's shoulder as they arrive at a hospital. David carries her inside where she, still in her performance attire, lies on an X-ray table wearing a protective lead apron around her waist. An X-ray machine aligns a cross-haired light pattern over her ankle. Meanwhile, in the waiting room, David sits with his head bowed and eyes closed, massaging the bridge of his nose.\n\nSuddenly, Thompson appears before him, prompting David to punch him in the face. As Thompson staggers back, two men in the waiting room stand up, watching David. Thompson adjusts his fedora and, with a stern expression, turns away, tipping his hat to one of the men as he exits. David, breathing heavily, watches him leave before sinking back into his chair, his head bowed in frustration.\n\nLater, David stands beside Elise's bed in the emergency room, gently touching her bandaged ankle propped up on pillows. He envelops her in a tight embrace, his eyes squeezed shut. When he finally opens his eyes, his expression is woeful, his gaze thoughtful as he reflects on the events.",

The young politician, with deep-set eyes, blinks and shifts his heartbroken gaze wistfully across the warehouse. David presses his lips together. Soon after, they walk along a covered outdoor walkway and pause at a door. Harry grips the knob of a side door, and they step through into a spacious white gallery adorned with paintings. Overwhelmed, the human follows eagerly.\n\nIn an upper gallery, a partial dinosaur skeleton dangles from the ceiling. From an overlooking upper level, Peter watches as Harry guides David to another door. David reassuringly places his hand on the agent's shoulder. Harry then ushers him into a service tunnel lined with pipework. David, taken aback by the sudden change, follows Harry down the damp corridor. They trace the path of a massive insulated pipe and descend a short staircase. Harry crosses the floor, ascends a steep staircase to a rust-eaten door, turns the knob counterclockwise, and opens it. Briefly, they catch sight of a stoic figure wearing a fedora passing by before Harry shuts the door. David watches him go.\n\nMeanwhile, Elise arrives at the Cedar Lake Dance Studio and confronts a receptionist. Back at the pumping station, Harry, carrying a briefcase, leads David to a service junction where a cinderblock worktable stands ready. He pulls two ledgers from his briefcase and hands one to David. As they discuss, we observe Elise dancing. Cautiously, she sits and then lies down, resting her hands on her abdomen. Harry, smiling to himself, places his plan book on the table. David's stare fixates on him. Pursing his lips and shifting his gaze, David nods stoically. Harry, lips pressed tight, takes a deep breath and nods in return. David regards him impassively.\n\nElise exits the dance studio into the cool night air and walks down the sidewalk. At dawn, a thick blanket of lead-gray clouds blankets the city. Raindrops pelt the side of the Adjustment Bureau high rise. In Madison Square Park, rain soaks Harry's bench. At the courthouse, Adrian faces a petite clerk. Elise, wearing a flowing black halter dress, arrives with a friend and stares blankly.\n\nBack in the pumping station, Harry and David reach a spiral staircase. Harry, smiling, hands his fedora to David. Under Harry's kind gaze, David places the fedora on his head and takes a controlled breath. As David ascends the spiral stairway, Harry watches him go. David bursts through a door with a brief stumble and dashes down a rainy alleyway. He sprints across a busy street, narrowly avoiding collisions with cars.",

As a lovely woman, now dotted with coffee, wipes her legs clean, a taxi collides with the stranger. The cab driver, alarmed, halts his vehicle and hurries to assist the fallen man. The stranger, undeterred, opens a book, revealing a line traversing a map at right angles. Observing a bus departing from a distance, the stranger notes the line on his book advancing towards a pulsing red dot and dashes to pursue the bus.\n\nBoarding the bus, a woman mischievously attempts to tip David's coffee cup. She seizes his phone and answers an incoming call, only to then drop the device into the bubbling coffee. David retrieves his phone and watches as the woman wipes it dry on her skirt. Outside, the mustached stranger hastens across the street as the bus comes to a stop. Elise disembarks, turning to face David, who lingers in the doorway as the bus doors shut. Through a window, Elise grins at him, then, with a teasing frown, gestures offensively. David, amused, observes her departure before resuming his seat, placing his coffee beside him, and noticing Elise's number scribbled on the back of one of his business cards. He makes a call but soon hangs up.\n\nLater, pushing through the revolving door of an office building, the stranger steps into an empty lobby. Passing between security scanners, he swipes his card and heads straight to an elevator, emerging in a reception area. The receptionist's attention remains fixed on her phone call as he hurries by. Another receptionist stares blankly ahead as he rushes past two men in a hallway and a third in a waiting area, entering a conference room.\n\nInside, men clad in sleek black body suits and visored helmets are working on his frozen colleagues. Two of them scan Charlie's face with wand-like devices as two men in hats observe, one of them being the stranger's superior. David, spotting the helmeted men closing in, races out, glimpsing his frozen coworkers as he sprints to the reception area. More men join the pursuit as David ascends some stairs, confronting the lead pursuer at the top. Fleeing down a corridor, he sees the white-haired boss exiting through a side door. Turning a corner, David faces the man once more, only to find him waiting at the end of another corridor. As several helmeted men converge, David retraces his steps, rushing into Charlie's office, locking the door behind him. He secures a second door leading to a small conference room and lifts the phone to his ear, waiting anxiously.",

From his room, Benjamin spots a taxi arriving outside and sees Daisy, now in her 20s, stepping out and approaching the house. To follow her movement, Benjamin moves to another window and watches as she enters through the gate. He then descends the stairs and peers at her through the kitchen window. Daisy greets Mrs. Maple's dog, prompting Benjamin to step outside and meet her. She approaches him hesitantly, her expression turning to shock before she embraces him warmly. Noticing some lint on his shirt, she removes it, and a laugh escapes her lips. They then move to sit on the bed together, and Daisy's eyes light up with pleasant surprise as she views an illustration.\n\nThat evening, their taxi pulls up at a fancy restaurant. Daisy and Benjamin exit the vehicle, and inside, a waiter courteously lights a cigarette for Daisy, who then elegantly blows out the smoke. Later, outside, Daisy steps onto a bandstand where she removes her shoes as light from water dances across the ceiling. Benjamin watches, utterly captivated, as she sheds her jacket and begins to dance. Her body bends and arches, her legs cross and her arms stretch out. Gracefully, she moves towards him, her arms waving overhead, then leans to her left and lifts her right leg high into the air. Her limbs almost parallel, she twists her body and arcs her leg upwards. Turning slowly, she gazes at Benjamin before sinking to her knees, arching her back until she lies flat on the floor. Rising again, she stands, walks towards him, and crouches beside him at the edge of the bandstand. She then gives him a lingering kiss, and though they part, their faces remain close. Benjamin looks down as Daisy pulls away, stands, dons her jacket, retrieves her shoes, and walks off the bandstand.\n\nIn a different scene, at a restaurant, Thomas, using a crutch, glances at an amputee in a wheelchair. Benjamin smiles, while Thomas appears thoughtful. Thomas then shows Benjamin a collection of military uniforms in his factory, turning on the lights to reveal the space. Benjamin stares blankly at Thomas, who stands partially obscured in shadow. Feeling awkward, Benjamin turns away, and Thomas shakes his head ruefully as Benjamin surveys the factory, later looking back at Thomas.\n\nIn a hallway filled with photos, one depicts a bride. Benjamin peers into a kitchen, and among the framed photos at Thomas's home, there's one of Thomas and Caroline on their wedding day.

She then strikes a stunning pose before turning to the audience, her neck arching elegantly like a swan. With a light skip, she returns to her partner's embrace, where he lifts her high above him, her knees bent and toes pointed. As they rotate, he gradually lowers her in a motion reminiscent of a helter-skelter ride. Benjamin, watching intently, remains captivated as the couple parts and then reunites, their dance a playful yet intense exchange of attraction and repulsion.\n\nBackstage, Benjamin approaches a man with a clipboard and follows him through a bustling corridor, waiting by Daisy's dressing room door. Daisy emerges in her underwear, spots Benjamin, and quickly dons a robe. Turning to face him, she smiles warmly upon seeing the bouquet of white daisies he presents. As Benjamin lowers his gaze shyly, Daisy, beaming, retreats back into her dressing room. Benjamin, left outside, turns away with a look of disappointment.\n\nLater, Benjamin and Daisy step out of an elevator into a dimly lit party where people dance and drink. Benjamin appears timid amidst the lively scene. Daisy, smiling, is suddenly embraced from behind by a handsome, dark-haired young man. She then trots off cheerfully. David and Benjamin observe as another man takes Daisy's coat, and she dances playfully with him. David heads straight to the dance floor, where Daisy is engaged in conversation with a middle-aged woman and an elderly man. Benjamin watches with a solemn expression as David pulls Daisy away, dancing intimately with her and twirling her around before sharing a lingering kiss. Their dance is interrupted when Daisy starts talking mid-sentence, only to be whisked away by yet another man. As Daisy dances between two men, Benjamin slowly heads towards the elevator. With an arm around David, Daisy catches sight of Benjamin leaving.\n\nOutside, Benjamin dons his coat and strides away into the night. Daisy quickly follows him, just as a yellow taxi pulls up and David waits beside it. Turning to Benjamin, Daisy gives a slight shrug. He blinks in response as she turns away and shakes her head, leaving Benjamin confused. Daisy then heads to the taxi, and as it drives off in the opposite direction, Benjamin walks away, hat in hand.\n\nIn a hospital, Caroline examines a theater flyer and retrieves a manila envelope from Daisy's bag, finding photos of Daisy in her youth as a dancer.

The nurse concludes her call, and Benjamin rises, entering a hospital ward where he walks past patients confined to their beds. He collides with someone as he approaches Daisy's bed, where she lies with a bruised face and her right leg elevated in a metal frame. Daisy opens her eyes, seeing Benjamin's image blurred. He sits down and smiles warmly, his young and fresh face soon falling as Daisy hides her face. Benjamin looks at her and then at the floor, his gaze returning to Daisy, who has her head turned away and her eyes closed. A moment passes before she turns her head to find him gone, noticing a swaying triangular support above her, which she grasps sharply.\n\nMeanwhile, Caroline reads on and then walks the street, standing on a street corner and staring upwards. Benjamin walks away from her apartment block as Caroline leaps up and leaves, her face etched with a harrowed expression. She meets the weary eyes of her aged mother, whose old wrist is bent unnaturally across her chest. Caroline sits back down and picks up the diary.\n\nIn another scene, Benjamin sails on a calm lake, then leaves a woman's doorstep. A dark-haired young woman, in a rush, puts on her shoes as she leaves Benjamin's bedroom, stopping abruptly when she sees an elderly resident staring at their rooms, at her. Fresh-faced with short-cropped hair and wearing a bright white T-shirt, Benjamin stares wistfully before approaching his window. He alights from his sailboat and strolls casually along the wooden jetty, later driving a blue motorbike parked outside. Watched by Queenie from a high window, he crosses the lawn past a man raking leaves. He removes his cap and glances up at Queenie while striding towards the main building, jogging up the steps where he was left as a baby, and pausing on the porch. Daisy stands behind him, and as he turns, he sees her standing in the doorway opposite, dressed in black with her hands knitted together at her waist.",
    "981": "As they arrived, their bags were set down gently on the floor. Benjamin cautiously peered into the kitchen and then directed his gaze down the narrow flight of steps leading to Queenie's basement bedroom. Daisy observed Benjamin as he made his way to the foot of the stairs. An elderly woman then emerged onto the landing, her presence quiet yet noticeable.\n\nIn a quaint white church, a mostly black congregation had gathered for a funeral. Queenie's daughter, draped in a black veil, sat solemnly beside a man dressed in a suit who nodded respectfully. Daisy and Benjamin positioned themselves at the end of the pew nearest the wall, watching as the mourners openly expressed their grief. At the front, Queenie lay in an open casket, serene yet poignant in her final repose. The man beside Queenie's daughter shook Benjamin's hand before moving on. As this happened, Daisy lowered her eyes while Benjamin maintained a serene forward gaze. Gradually, people began to rise from the pews, and the framed family photograph on the wall bore silent witness to the scene.\n\nIn another moment, Daisy attempted to turn on a bathroom tap, only to find no water flowed. In a rush, wrapped in a bed sheet, she hurried into the bathroom as Benjamin, fully clothed, received a delivery at the fridge freezer. Later, both fully dressed, they turned their attention to decorating the house. Amidst this, Benjamin playfully painted Daisy's bottom with a pink roller, prompting her to chase him with a brush in retaliation. As night enveloped them, they danced and twisted on the mattress in their lamp-lit bedroom. Benjamin removed his T-shirt, and they shared a kiss before he lay on top of her. In their cozy home, Benjamin hung a picture and made popcorn as they settled down to watch The Beatles perform on a black and white television.\n\nA woman was seen performing physiotherapy on Daisy's leg. At the edge of the swimming pool, Daisy surfaced, watching a young woman dive into the water and swim front crawl with ease. Benjamin, dressed in a white shirt, appeared at the poolside and observed the scene. As the young woman effortlessly swam and then climbed out of the pool, Daisy watched with a tinge of sadness in her eyes. Overcome with emotion, Daisy sobbed, resting her arms on the poolside and lulling her head. Meanwhile, daylight began to pour through the tall windows as Benjamin strolled calmly to the water's edge. Daisy's head remained buried in the crook of her arm, a silent expression of her feelings.\n\nWearing a headscarf, Daisy rode with Benjamin on his motorcycle, navigating halfway down a winding road under a sky crackling with lightning. After parking the bike, Benjamin, draped in a patchwork blanket and carrying two mugs, walked up from behind and approached Daisy. She was seated on a bench along the boardwalk near the wooden railings, staring down the length of the derelict jetty towards the lake beyond. He handed her a drink and joined her on the bench. Together, they were bathed in the warm glow of the rising sun.\n\nIn a dance studio, Daisy moved gracefully through the space as young girls filed out. She then locked up and placed her keys by a desk. The tall studio mirrors stretched along the wall opposite the front windows, reflecting her as she strolled across the varnished wooden floorboards. Daisy paused to regard her reflection, posing elegantly with one arm elevated.",
    "982": "Benjamin, hands nestled in his pockets, observes as she attempts a turn but stumbles clumsily, her bad leg causing her to flex it awkwardly. She then straightens her leg and completes her turn, steadying herself by gripping a ballet bar mounted on the wall. She lifts her right leg tightly behind her. Benjamin, his arm around her, joins her in gazing at their reflections in the mirror. Daisy, with a smile, turns to him and looks gravely at his reflection. He removes his arm from her shoulder, locking eyes with her. Daisy's expression searches for something, while Benjamin responds with a smile. She embraces him tightly with her arms.\n\nThey find themselves sitting side by side on a tram. Daisy smiles warmly as Benjamin gazes out the window, appearing somewhat distant. He snaps back from his reverie and looks at Daisy, who smiles at him fondly. His attention shifts to a man nearby, sitting with his young daughter who is flexing and tilting her head. Daisy puts an arm around Benjamin and softly kisses him on the cheek.\n\nAs night falls, they sit across from each other in a diner. Daisy finishes her ice cream sundae, delicately brushing a tiny piece of spilled ice cream from her swollen belly. Benjamin leans back in his seat. Daisy reaches for his hand, and he responds with a smile that lacks conviction, though it soon brightens into a genuine beam. She tenderly kisses his hand. Wearing an autumnal-colored poncho, Daisy heads to the toilet. Benjamin leaves money on the counter. In the corner, a television plays, showing Elizabeth grinning on screen. Upon Daisy's return, they exit the diner together.\n\nHe pauses across the lounge while Daisy is found at the bottom of some stairs, bleeding. Benjamin rushes to the phone and then dashes down the basement stairs to find Daisy sprawled on the bloodstained floor next to a wash basket. Back in the kitchen, alone, Benjamin paces anxiously, occasionally peering into the corridor and leaning on a kitchen surface. A uniformed man and a female doctor emerge from the bedroom through different doors. Benjamin, with a doe-eyed expression, enters the bedroom to see Daisy lying with a newborn baby. He sits on the bed, and they both gaze at their daughter, wrapped in a blanket. Daisy, with teary eyes, gently places her little finger in the infant's mouth to soothe her crying, then looks back at Benjamin. He lovingly caresses his daughter.\n\nIn the hospital, Caroline turns to her mother, sharing a poignant look before she places a diary down and leaves Daisy's bedside. Daisy, her brow furrowed and face gaunt, watches as Caroline walks into the corridor. Back in Daisy's room, the clock beside the wall-mounted TV shows five minutes to ten. Caroline lights a cigarette, catching the attention of a nurse who is eating an apple. The TV weatherman appears on the screen. Caroline looks at Daisy, who taps a fist on the bedside table. Caroline picks up the diary and reads aloud by the window.",
    "975": "The movie opens with a cascade of colored buttons tumbling down to form the iconic Warner Brothers' shield, followed by an additional shower of buttons. The scene shifts to an elderly woman, Daisy, lying frail and ashen-faced in a hospital bed, her sunken eyes briefly opening before closing again. She wears a tight turban as her daughter, 30-something Caroline, approaches her bedside, clasping her hand. Daisy, meanwhile, is seen scratching her chest. A nurse moves around the bed to adjust Daisy's IV drip, after which Daisy's eyes close once more. Caroline, with dark hair and a pensive look, takes Daisy's hand gently in her own, then embraces her. Sitting up, Caroline strokes her mother's arm as Daisy's eyes slightly open, her brow furrowing in response.\n\nThe narrative then shifts to a flashback of a grand train station dominated by a colonnade, where Caroline listens intently to a watch smith, a bald man wearing dark glasses and a mustache. The scene transitions to Caroline and her husband seeing their son off at the station. Later, at a dining table, Mrs. Gateau opens a letter and exchanges a look with her husband, who wipes his mouth and leaves. They later stand on a platform where uniformed men unload coffins from a steam train, and then they depart from the gravesite. In another scene, the husband fits a large brass cog, while a crowd gathers at the train station to watch Mr. Gateau on a wooden scaffold platform, unveiling a massive embossed brass wall clock. Its second hand begins to turn backwards, prompting a bowler hat-wearing man to point as scenes unfold in reverse: a fallen soldier rises and runs backward from an explosion, soldiers retreat over mud, and their son descends from the train as it reverses into the station. On the concourse, President Roosevelt, removing his trilby, hangs his head before looking up again. Grainy footage shows Mr. Gateau rowing out to sea in a wooden boat.\n\nBack in the hospital, the nurse rises from a corner seat and walks past an empty neighboring bed. Caroline, appearing pale and thoughtful, closes her eyes. She then moves to a sofa, uncovering Daisy's suitcase which contains a leather-bound book with a black-and-white wedding photo inside. Meanwhile, fireworks light up the streets filled with revelers waving American flags. Thomas Button, now in his 40s, dashes through the crowd towards a house on the corner. As he races up the front steps, his trilby blows off, and he enters the house. Inside, a maid closes the door as Thomas rushes to an upstairs bedroom where his wife lies in a large bed under blood-stained sheets. Thomas removes his coat as a doctor approaches, and upon turning, he sees a priest. He strides to his wife's bedside, nods, and as the priest gives the last rites, Thomas cautiously approaches the baby's cot.",
    "986": "In the sparse basement room of Queenie, she turns the baby towards an old woman, prompting the baby to chuckle. Tizzy enters, and from her bed, Queenie observes him as he removes his suit jacket and fixes his gaze on Benjamin, who lies in a drawer beside Queenie's bed. Tizzy then sits on the bed, meeting Queenie's glare, her brows raised in scrutiny. Dressed in a white nightdress, she watches as Tizzy momentarily looks away before picking up his jacket and moving towards the door, only to pause and remove his spectacles, placing them on the dresser. He then throws his black jacket over the steel bed frame and sits close to Queenie. As this unfolds, Benjamin stirs in his makeshift cot. The tension eases as Tizzy and Queenie embrace, their eyes locking before she leans forward to kiss him tenderly on the lips. He responds by cupping her neck, and they sink down onto the bed, continuing their kiss.\n\nAs a child, Benjamin, resembling a bald, old man, sits at a dining table using an ear trumpet. He sports round glasses and has wispy, white hair around his shiny, bald head. Later, he propels himself back and forth along a porch in his wheelchair until an elderly resident wedges a walking stick between the wooden spokes, halting his progress. The old man then removes the stick, allowing Benjamin to wheel himself to the top of the front steps where he watches children playing in the street, his wheels perilously close to the top step.\n\nBenjamin lies at Queenie's bedside, clasping her hand, as Tizzy enters the room. In another scene, Tizzy ascends the stairs, carrying the frail, child-sized Benjamin in his arms. Alone in the empty lounge, Benjamin sits in his wheelchair while an elderly woman sleeps in a chair in the corner of the dark, wood-paneled room. He then wheels himself to the glass-paned double front doors, stands up, and peers out, his breath fogging the glass. Suddenly, his legs give way, and he collapses.\n\nOutside, in the rain, a naked old man raises a flag up a flagpole. A white-haired old woman with scarlet lipstick is seen. Inside, Queenie bathes Benjamin with the bathroom door wide open, attempting to straighten his stiff, right leg. Meanwhile, Tizzy is washing up.\n\nThe scene shifts to a large marquee where Benjamin dozes in a wicker-backed wheelchair. Queenie wakes him and rises primly to her feet, approached by women in white uniforms and nurses' hats. Nearby, a preacher in a suit stands. Queenie, wearing a pale orange dress, places her purse beside Benjamin and whispers to the bespectacled preacher, who then puts an arm around her and looks at the congregation. The mustachioed preacher places a hand on Queenie's belly before pushing her into the arms of the nurses, helping her back to her feet. Finally, the preacher removes Benjamin's boater and stares at him intently.",
    "994": "Nick grins as he starts to walk away, but then turns to Gatsby, who nods in acknowledgment. Nick smiles thoughtfully before turning to go. Meanwhile, Gatsby heads up the steps to the grand house, pausing at the top to look up at the mansion with a thoughtful expression. He continues up the grand staircase, flanked by a servant on either side as they walk on to the house.\n\nIn his doctor's office, Nick sits at a typewriter, and a female staff member brings him breakfast on a tray. Outside, photographers crowd around a car, continuing their stakeout of the mansion.\n\nInside, Gatsby and Daisy make love, their passion evident as they lie together in bed in the dark. The curtains billow gently in the open windows. They remain close, lying next to each other, later standing at the end of the dock and gazing across the calm bay.\n\nGatsby suddenly looks around and spots Herzog nearby, then again sees him lurking in the shadows. Herzog turns and walks off. Nick appears unsure and lost in thought.\n\nAt the Buchanans', Tom, Gatsby, Daisy, Nick, and Jordan sit around a dining table. Gatsby, wearing a pale-pink suit, frowns heavily while Tom paces and lights a cigar. Gatsby and Daisy exchange apprehensive looks as servants attend to them. Tom glances at Gatsby, who points at something, then gets up and moves his hand towards Daisy's on the white tablecloth. She pulls away abruptly.\n\nDaisy, attempting to light a cigarette, fumbles with the lighter and drops it. Gatsby picks it up for her, lights the cigarette, and she cups her hand around his as he regards her earnestly. Daisy looks at him with tears brimming in her eyes. Tom, glowering, steps closer, watching the scene unfold along with Nick, who listens with interest. Tom stubs out his cigar as Daisy, looking increasingly anxious, marches off down the hall followed by Jordan. Tom and Gatsby exchange a look before Tom walks off.\n\nIn the driveway, Gatsby's yellow Deusenberg and Tom's smaller blue coupe are driven up. Tom drives ahead with Nick and Jordan beside him, while Gatsby and Daisy follow in the coupe. They speed along country roads, Tom driving recklessly at high speed, narrowly missing one car and overtaking several others. Ahead, a truck has spilled its load of crates containing fruit and vegetables. Tom veers around, squashing watermelons and nearly hitting an oncoming car.\n\nThey drive on to the filthy gray Valley of Ashes, where an oculist's billboard, featuring a pair of eyes framed by rusty spectacles, stares down unnervingly. They head to Wilson's garage, where Wilson looks ill, and Myrtle watches from an upstairs window.",
    "995": "Tom spots a woman as Gatsby approaches. Tom, feeling overwhelmed, panics and then aggressively tosses money at Wilson before speeding off in pursuit of Gatsby and Daisy, who have surged ahead. Meanwhile, Myrtle, watching from an upstairs window, appears both desperate and tearful. Gatsby and Tom drive along a grimy road, passing mounds of trash and coal waste, and then proceed side by side across the Queensboro Bridge. Gatsby, glancing at Tom to his left, accelerates forcefully, edging his coupe ahead. Daisy, grinning broadly, waves enthusiastically as they pass a train and enter New York City.\n\nIn the opulent suite at the Plaza Hotel, Tom observes an employee meticulously chipping at a large block of ice with an ice pick. The windows are flung wide open, and multiple fans are running. The rest of the group sits around, sipping whiskey. The chipped ice is carefully placed on a tray, and sweat glistens on their faces. Seeking relief, Tom presses a piece of ice against his neck. Nick and Jordan closely observe the unfolding conversation. Gatsby, frowning, nods at Tom from across the room. He takes a sip of whiskey, moves to a window, and then turns to face Tom, who stands with his back turned, holding Daisy's hand. Tom, simmering with silent rage, eventually turns to confront Gatsby. Daisy sits down slowly, her eyes filling with tears as she shakes her head. Tom, visibly unnerved, glowers while Daisy's head droops forward, tears streaming from her eyes. Gatsby smiles questioningly, then drinks again.\n\nThe tension escalates as Gatsby grabs Tom by his shirt collar, looming over him with a raised fist. Tom momentarily rests his forehead against Gatsby's, then grins as if victorious. Daisy and Jordan, overwhelmed with fear, cover their faces. Gatsby, looking shocked and breathing heavily, steps back from Tom. Daisy, tears brimming in her eyes, stares at Gatsby as he approaches her, only for more tears to flood from her eyes. Tom checks his watch, and in a rush of emotion, Gatsby knocks over a lamp as he exits the room. Tom forcefully shuts the door, causing a phone book to fall, then takes a large gulp of whiskey. Nick, deeply frowning, goes to the window and remains there, occasionally turning to look inside. Tom, meanwhile, opens another bottle of whiskey and averts his gaze.\n\nAs the scene shifts, they cross back over the Queensboro Bridge. Myrtle, with a cut on her forehead, is seen as Wilson violently shakes her by the poles around her neck. She retaliates by hitting him and then flees. The bright yellow Deusenberg speeds through the Valley of Ashes. Myrtle, spotting the car, dashes into the road. As another vehicle nears, Gatsby, at the wheel of the Deusenberg, tries to swerve but it's too late. The Deusenberg collides with Myrtle, who is thrown onto the bonnet, smashes against the windshield, and is hurled into the air.",
    "997": "Nick, wearing a perplexed frown, stands in the shadows at the cottage, deeply immersed in thought. His gaze shifts across to Gatsby's mansion just as the yellow Duesenberg pulls up. Curious, Nick approaches and discovers Gatsby diligently scrubbing Myrtle's blood from the car's front. The vehicle bears the marks of an accident: a dented right fender and a cracked windscreen. Gatsby, kneeling with a rag and bucket, cautiously surveys his surroundings before they cover the car together. With a sharp nod and an emphatic gesture, Gatsby directs Herzog back into the house and then opens the door himself. He pauses, scanning the area, then points at the sky, catching Nick's attention. Warily, Nick follows Gatsby into the house.\n\nAs dawn breaks and the sky lightens, they find themselves standing on the dock. Gatsby's gaze sweeps across the bay, lost in contemplation. Meanwhile, at the garage, Wilson, grappling with his emotions, tosses Myrtle's pills into a drawer, raises a revolver, and stares at it intensely before meeting the gaze of the eyes on the Dr. Eckleburg billboard. The golden sun rises over a calm bay, setting a serene backdrop as Gatsby and Nick sit on the terrace. Gatsby steps into the sunlight, leading Nick down steps and across the ornamental terrace toward the pool. Gatsby moves between two tall stone urns and descends further steps, while Nick remains at the top. Turning back, Gatsby smiles at Nick, who then opens a low metal gate. They exchange thoughtful smiles before Nick departs, leaving Gatsby leaning on the gate, his eyes lifting to the sky. Nick walks off along the gravel path beneath the terrace, winding through the ornamental garden. He pauses, looking back at Gatsby, who smiles fondly. They wave to each other in a moment of quiet connection.\n\nNick, appearing sleepy, sits among busy workers. Meanwhile, Gatsby, donning a swimming costume, stands by the pool before diving into the azure water. Simultaneously, at home, Daisy sits by a telephone, her complexion pale and her expression distant. Gatsby swims deeper into the pool as, across the grounds, Wilson, revolver in hand, stealthily moves through the shadows. Daisy approaches the telephone and lifts the receiver just as Gatsby surfaces to the sound of his phone ringing. A hopeful smile graces Gatsby's face as he climbs the steps at the pool's edge, his gaze drawn across the bay to the Buchanan mansion. Herzog answers the phone, and at that moment, Wilson approaches Gatsby from behind and shoots him in the back. Gatsby's body flinches, and he touches his chest, examining his finger in disbelief. Herzog turns around, witnessing the scene. Gatsby, his deep blue eyes wide with shock, looks once more across the Bay of Consequence toward the Buchanans'. His mouth hangs open, his eyes glazing over as life fades from him, and his eyelids slowly droop.",
    "999": "High atop a skyscraper, a workman diligently hammers a steel girder, sending sparks flying into the air. Meanwhile, Nick awakens on a porch swing outside his cottage, clad only in his underwear. From a nearby window, Gatsby observes the scene quietly.\n\nNick receives a personal invitation to a grand event, and soon, cars packed with enthusiastic partygoers begin arriving at Gatsby's sprawling, illuminated mansion, highlighted by a prominent fountain out front. As Nick approaches the mansion with his invitation in hand, he is swept up in the surging crowd heading towards the cavernous ballroom.\n\nInside, the atmosphere is electric. A spotlighted dancer twirls with enormous multicolored feathers, while a giant, dome-shaped crystal chandelier glitters overhead. A large pipe organ stands on a raised platform, and a flood-lit blue pool sits at the center of the ballroom. Nick wanders through the crowd, smiling, as he observes the spectacle: a dancer hanging upside-down from the ceiling, and someone playing the massive organ as people dance everywhere.\n\nNick engages in conversation with a barman and quickly downs a martini. His outfit consists of beige boots, white trousers and shirt, a dark-blue blazer, and a bowtie. On the dance floor, two flapper girls in flouncy yellow dresses perform the Charleston with a man standing on a podium. An extremely attractive young woman gracefully moves through the crowd.\n\nNick's attention shifts to Jordan, who removes her hat. Nearby, Gilda shimmies across the dance floor in a cream flapper dress adorned with tiers of tassels, her movements energetic and fluid as she swishes and sways. The dance floor becomes increasingly crowded.\n\nNick and Jordan ascend the stairs, and at the top, Jordan leans closely into Nick before leaning against some doors. Nick playfully pushes her, leading them to tumble into a library. An old man descends the library steps and hands them drinks. From a window, they watch the party below, pulsating with energy as people dance wildly, and colorful confetti cascades from the ceiling. The band members are dressed in red fezzes, adding to the festive mood.\n\nGuests, including Nick, leap into the round pool for a refreshing dip. Back in the crowd, Nick extends his hand to Jordan, who is dancing with Teddy Barton, a chiseled young man with slicked hair. Nick pulls her away from Teddy, and they shimmy together on a circular platform over the pool's center, with glittering strings flying through the air. Teddy grabs Jordan's hand, but she turns back to Nick, leaving him looking miffed.\n\nA man then turns to Nick, smiling. Nick, in awe, gazes at Gatsby—a handsome, fine-featured man with bright eyes and swept-back, wavy brown hair. Gatsby engages with Jordan, kissing her hand and squeezing Nick's shoulder. The night sky erupts in fireworks as Gatsby nods to both Nick and Jordan before departing. Jordan, smiling, turns back to Nick.\n\nAn older, distinguished-looking man, Herzog, leaves Jordan bewildered. From the top of the stairs, Gatsby watches for a moment before walking away, leaving the vibrant party behind.",
    "1000": "As the evening unfolds at Gatsby's lavish party, Jordan gives Nick a bemused glance before venturing off in search of the enigmatic host. Meanwhile, Nick stands alone, a frown etched on his face, as the rest of the guests are mesmerized by the dazzling fireworks bursting into the night sky like a thousand silver stars. From an upstairs window, Gatsby watches the spectacle, the sparkles reflected in the glass. Jordan, graceful as ever, glides across the confetti-strewn dance floor and ascends the stairs. At the top, she passes through ornate double doors while Nick, still frowning, turns his back to the fireworks to watch her.\n\nGatsby, standing by the same window, offers a benign smile and puffs on a cigarette. Nick, momentarily distracted, turns to admire the fireworks' spectacular display, watching as twinkling specks of light gently descend, reminiscent of snowflakes. Nearby, shimmering golden flakes pour from an oversized champagne bottle, floating down onto the lounging guests nestled among floor cushions. Nick, reclining dreamily, gazes up at the photos and paintings adorning the walls. As the festivities continue, a barman tidies up, and a woman languidly drapes herself across a piano.\n\nJordan reappears, this time accompanied by Teddy. They are soon whisked away in a car, while Gatsby, observing from the top of the steps, presses his lips together thoughtfully before offering a polite smile and departing. Laughter and chatter fill the air as people cavort by the fountain. Jordan, waving goodbye from her departing vehicle, catches Nick's eye, who smiles and waves back in return. Nick then embarks on a solitary walk down the dimly lit driveway towards his cottage. Pausing to glance back at Gatsby's mansion, he notices Gatsby, watching from an upstairs window, slowly lowering a telephone before waving. Nick reciprocates the gesture.\n\nInside the mansion, Gatsby stands with a painting of charging stags looming behind him, his smile charming and engaging. However, once Nick's attention is diverted, Gatsby's smile fades, and he lifts the telephone to his ear once more. Back in his cottage, Nick, immersed in a book, is startled by the sound of an engine. He frowns, rises, and peers out of the window to see Gatsby circling the cottage in a vibrant yellow Duesenberg coupe, its open top and white-wall tires gleaming under the moonlight, complemented by four chrome side pipes curling down from the engine.\n\nStepping outside, Nick hastily ties his dressing gown and nervously takes the passenger seat in Gatsby's car. Gatsby drives at breakneck speed along a winding country road, deftly weaving in and out of traffic, smiling and patting his leg in rhythm. He overtakes other vehicles, takes sharp corners, and narrowly avoids a pedestrian. When a motorcycle cop pulls up alongside them, Gatsby casually holds up his business card, prompting the officer to peel away. As they approach the Queensboro Bridge, they drive parallel to a convertible operated by a white chauffeur carrying two black couples enjoying champagne in the backseat, a sight that leaves Nick visibly bemused.\n\nTheir journey concludes at a barber shop where a distinguished, gray-haired man with a matching beard and mustache sits. Gatsby, after entering, taps on a wall, signaling perhaps another layer of mystery to unfold.",
    "1004": "Gatsby, noticing Nick's gaze upon him, quickly checks his appearance. As the melodious tones of the organ fill the air, a smile graces Gatsby's face. Nick and Daisy, beaming with joy, are gestured towards the opulent ballroom by Gatsby. The organ is played by Klipspringer, a young man sporting wild hair and glasses. Gatsby reclines luxuriously on cushions, observing Nick and Daisy as they twirl and dance amidst the ballroom's enchanting glow from countless candles. Daisy, spinning gracefully, faces Nick, and together they shimmy with delight.\n\nAs Gatsby watches, his mind drifts back to a poignant memory of himself in uniform, dancing and sharing a tender kiss with Daisy. His expression turns solemn, haunted by memories of the battlefield. Meanwhile, rain begins to pour, drenching the terrace and the long, narrow dock that extends into the bay. Across the water, shrouded in a gentle mist, the green light at the end of Daisy's dock pulses rhythmically.\n\nKlipspringer, exhausted, falls asleep right on the organ keys. Nick, seeking a moment of solitude, sits on the stairs and sips a drink. The atmosphere shifts as Gatsby and Daisy share a slow dance, swaying gently to the music. Nick approaches them, observing their tender moment before quietly leaving them be. Daisy gazes at Gatsby with deep affection, leading to a loving kiss where Gatsby rests his cheek against hers. Nick, watching from a distance, wears a grave, serious expression.\n\nThe scene transitions to one of Gatsby's extravagant parties, where flamboyantly dressed guests revel wildly, drinking, dancing, and splashing in the ornamental pool. Gatsby, ever the gracious host, smiles politely. They navigate through the bustling party with Nick. Gatsby takes Daisy's arm in a gentle but firm grasp. Meanwhile, Tom, accompanied by Nick, strolls through the crowd. Later, they are seen seated at tables on a raised platform, overlooking the lively scene below. Gatsby smiles once more, while Tom appears visibly bored. Tom pauses, lost in thought, before looking at Gatsby with a hint of bemusement. The butler, Herzog, approaches Gatsby and leans down to relay a message. Mr. Slagle, a stern man in a sharp suit, arrives with his associates.\n\nAmidst the band's lively music, Gatsby and Tom exchange a courteous smile. Gatsby rises, gesturing towards the dance floor. Daisy, curious, glances around before Gatsby, smiling, stands and leads her to dance. Before leaving, Daisy discreetly slips a silver pencil into Tom's breast pocket. As they dance, Tom surveys the room and notices the attractive actress, Marlene Moon. He raises his eyebrows and nods in her direction. Nearby, an older man dances with a younger woman. Gatsby, twirling with Daisy, catches sight of Tom and Nick following Marlene upstairs. She smiles brightly at Gatsby as Tom and Nick watch the couple dance. Tom, scanning the room once more, sees Marlene looking at him expectantly. He joins her, not without a glance back at Nick, who half-heartedly raises his glass and turns his attention back to the dancers.\n\nGatsby whispers to Daisy, guiding her away through the crowd of slow-dancing couples. Nick, observing this with a frown, follows them outside. Gatsby follows Daisy through a gate, nodding to a couple of servants as they cross the terrace. Outside, Nick stands by a drinks table adorned with a cocktail fountain.",
    "1006": "As the Queen sits for a portrait, adorned in her formal state robes, her focus shifts momentarily to a television broadcasting news about Tony Blair. Tony, dressed casually in a lounge suit without a jacket, smiles at a cheering crowd. The artist, Crawford, diligently continues his oil painting, capturing the Queen, who offers him a gentle smile. Her posture is half in profile, dressed in a white embroidered dress and a black velvet cloak, adorned with the star and shield of St. George's Cross. As she subtly shifts from the formal pose, her expression remains mostly unchanged.\n\nElsewhere, a solitary pipo strolls along an extended colonnade at Buckingham Palace, under gray skies where the royal standard flag flutters softly in the breeze. In a contrasting, darker setting, the Queen lies in bed when a door behind her opens. A woman enters, placing a newspaper on the bedside table, which the Queen then examines.\n\nThe scene shifts to the Queen at a desk, accompanied by her corgis, as Robin enters. Outside, a black Jaguar car halts in the palace courtyard, its rear door opened by a man in black coattails, revealing Tony and Cherie Blair inside. They are escorted through a grandiose, ornate hall by a man in naval attire. Cherie smirks at Tony as they approach a set of impressive, closed doors. Cherie takes a seat by the doors while Tony is ushered into a room where the Queen awaits, standing centrally. Both men bow to her, and Tony shakes her hand. He waits for her to sit before taking his own seat opposite her. Meanwhile, Cherie and the equerry sit on chairs flanking the grand doors, soon standing as the ceremony continues.\n\nAt the Queen's gesture, Tony kneels, takes her extended right hand, and kisses it. The Queen then signals for him to stand and rings a small bell, prompting the equerry to reenter with Cherie following. Cherie curtseys and the Queen, looking down, smiles at her before shaking her hand. The Queen then moves to shake hands with both Cherie and Tony once more. As Tony and Cherie awkwardly back out of the room, the Queen assesses them as they leave. They smile at the staff upon their departure.\n\nIn a shift of focus, a photograph captures Princess Diana and Dodi lounging together, followed by another image of Diana sitting alone on a diving board.

With a fixed stare, she studies her reflection intently.\n\nThe Queen then descends a staircase, her expression troubled, as Prince Philip steps out from a nearby room. Hastening her pace, she rushes into the courtyard, quickly dons a head scarf, and gets into the driver's seat of a nearby Land Rover. The vehicle pulls away, swiftly followed by three bodyguards who jump into another car to trail her.\n\nMeanwhile, Alastair bursts into Tony's office and approaches the door, while Tony watches him leave the room. The Queen's Land Rover arrives at a country estate, still shadowed by the bodyguards' car. She steps out, surveying her surroundings, as a middle-aged man wearing a cloth cap emerges from a nearby door. Upon spotting the Queen, he respectfully removes his cap and unlocks the door to a small stone building, opening it for her to enter.\n\nInside, the Queen removes her sunglasses and her gaze falls upon a stag hanging by its feet from the ceiling, its body skinned and its head removed, with a patch of blood beneath it. Nearby, on a table, the stag's head and antlers are arranged side by side. She gently touches the side of the stag's head, momentarily catching her breath and turning away from the man. Composing herself with closed eyes, she eventually faces him again, her attention drawn back to the stag's body before she moves towards the door, which the man promptly opens for her.\n\nVideo footage captures a sea of flowers around Buckingham Palace's gates and walls, with crowds bustling around outside. Inside a plane, the Queen sits and stares out the window, lost in contemplation. Robin appears before her, but after a brief glance, she turns back to the window. Robin continues to gaze at her until she looks at him again, and then he leaves, revealing the Queen Mother sitting opposite the Queen.\n\nBack on the ground, Alastair is handed a sheet of paper and takes a seat at his desk. Video footage then shows the Queen arriving at Buckingham Palace, where black cars drive up to the palace past crowds of people behind barriers. Inside one of the cars, the Queen and Prince Philip observe the onlookers. In his office, Alastair scribbles notes on the sheet he received before handing it over to Tony.",
    "1013": "The Queen begins her day by examining notes attached to the palace gates, one of which features a crying face. After reading a third message, she lowers her gaze in distress but quickly regains her composure, turning to the crowd with a grateful smile before resuming her perusal of the notes. She flinches momentarily but continues walking, looking increasingly upset yet determined to maintain her composure as she moves among the flowers and further notes laid out by the onlookers.\n\nShe pauses, turning back to the crowd with a smile, and proceeds to the barriers to engage with the people. At the forefront stand various young women, and as the Queen slowly moves along, she smiles at them warmly. She stops before a little girl holding a bouquet of flowers, which the child hands over to her, prompting another smile from the Queen as she accepts the gift and continues her journey.\n\nAs she passes, a group of older women curtsy respectfully, and Prince Philip follows closely behind her. More women curtsy as she progresses. The Queen then transitions to an ornate hall, walking past TV lighting and camera equipment, approaching a sofa where she sits next to Philip. She retrieves a pen from her purse and writes on a sheet of paper, then moves to a nearby table to deposit it, studying it briefly before approaching a podium set against a window backdrop.\n\nMeanwhile, Philip wanders to another part of the room, observing both the TV crew and the Queen. A young makeup artist applies powder to the Queen's nose, with the crowds still visible outside the window. Video footage later shows the setup of TV lights within a hall at Buckingham Palace. Inside, Charles joins Philip, standing by his side as the makeup artist completes her work on the Queen's face. The Queen then dons her spectacles, and Charles takes a seat while Philip remains standing, both watching the proceedings.\n\nCharles monitors the action on a screen as the Queen Mother, Tony, and Cherie watch the broadcast on their TVs. Cherie expresses disbelief, gently shaking her head as Tony watches intently. The Queen, now at the podium, stares blankly into the TV camera.\n\nAs night falls, video footage captures a procession of cars moving slowly along roads lined with crowds, camera flashes erupting continuously as people swarm around the vehicles. On a bright Saturday, a white helicopter flies through the clear daylight sky. Video footage later reveals a vast park filled with thousands of people, all facing a pair of giant video screens positioned at one side of the park.",
    "1016": "Mike conceals himself in the foliage, watching intently. As she turns to leave, Colin seizes her arm, drawing her near for a prolonged kiss. Mike, his mouth agape, watches in astonishment. Colin flashes a smile at Abby as they head towards their respective apartments across from one another. Abby playfully waves a giant foam hand she acquired at the game. Colin disappears into his apartment while Abby dashes along the path to meet Mike, enveloping him in a warm embrace before sprinting joyfully back to her own apartment. Mike then wanders off.\n\nOn a television show, Mike dons a gorilla costume. Behind the hosts, Larry and Georgia, a screen displays footage of monkeys mating. Abby and Joy are fixated on a monitor, witnessing Mike's nephew Joe in the gorilla suit. Abby, brimming with excitement, leaps and grins.\n\nThe next morning, Abby emerges from her apartment to find a gift bag on her doormat. With a puzzled frown, she picks it up and scans her surroundings before retreating inside. She extracts an envelope from the bag and then a box, which she opens to reveal a pair of remote-controlled, vibrating briefs. In front of her mirror, Abby applies lipstick and then perches on the arm of a chair, sipping white wine while eyeing the briefs contemplatively. She slides her hands under her dress, removes her old briefs, and as D'Artagnan the cat saunters by and leaps onto a chair, Abby dons the black, lacy vibrating briefs. After adjusting her dress, she notices D'Artagnan watching as she picks up the small, cylindrical remote control. She tucks the briefs and their box behind a cushion, slips the remote into her handbag, and exits her apartment.\n\nOutside, Mike and Stuart await. Abby gives a bitter smile as they climb into Stuart's car. They arrive at a restaurant where executives have gathered. Mike wraps his arms around bikini-clad women as they all sit at a table with the executives. Tension rises when Abby kicks Mike, inadvertently knocking over her bag and spilling the remote control onto the floor. A young boy finds the remote, picks it up, and activates it, causing Abby to squirm uncomfortably. Both Abby and Mike glance under the table, and as the boy shakes the remote, Abby stiffens and crosses her legs, gesturing towards her feet. Mike spots the boy with the device, and after a glare from Abby and a wink from him, Mike snatches the remote from the boy's hands. Abby quickly retrieves it from Mike.\n\nLater, leaning on a railing, they watch the rest of the group. Mike's eyes linger on Abby and Colin as they depart. Stuart approaches them as they stand on a country road, surrounded by lush, green trees and dappled sunlight.",
    "1018": "In a dimly lit ballroom, Abby and Mike begin their dance by sinking down and seductively moving their shoulders from side to side. They clasp hands and encircle each other's waists, turning gracefully in circles to the rhythm of the music. Abby leans back into Mike's supportive arm as they continue dancing with their hands pressed palm to palm. Raising their hands above their heads, Mike then sinks down while Abby sways rhythmically to the music. Mike gently caresses her hair and runs his hands down her sides. As Abby spins out, her hair whirls around her, and Mike pulls her back into his embrace, both smiling with happiness. They continue dancing closely, Abby wrapping her arms around Mike's neck. Mike spins her back and forth before pulling her even closer, their noses nearly touching, gazing into each other's eyes with mouths slightly parted, as if poised to kiss.\n\nAbby blinks in surprise, and Mike nods reluctantly. She offers a nervous smile and starts to walk away, with Mike following, his expression dazed. Carrying her shoes, Abby walks alongside Mike to an elevator. Mike presses the call button, turns to face Abby, and they both fidget awkwardly. Once inside the elevator, they stand side by side. Mike presses the buttons and loosens his jacket, receiving a fleeting smile from Abby. They share a hug, and Mike momentarily stops the doors from closing, leading to another hug. Suddenly, they wrap their arms around each other and share a hungry kiss, Mike pressing Abby against the edge of the open door. The elevator doors close, leaving Mike shocked and walking off with his mouth agape, while Abby, equally surprised, lets herself into her room. Inside, she lets her jacket and bag fall to the floor, drops her key on a table, and flops onto the couch, frowning. She removes her shoes, flinging them aside before quickly standing, smoothing her tight-fitting beige dress, and approaching the door.\n\nOpening the door, Abby looks horrified to see Colin standing there, his shirt drenched in champagne. Colin removes his shirt, exposing his toned chest, just as Mike marches down a corridor. Mike stops, turns around, then continues walking before turning again and gesturing emphatically. He arrives at Abby's door and knocks. Abby stares at Mike from within her room, then dashes out and runs down the corridor after him. Mike stops and turns to face her. Abby frowns, steps closer, and fixes an intense gaze on him. Mike shakes his head, prompting Abby's smile to harden into a resolute expression. As Mike walks away with his hands in his pockets, Abby watches with an anxious, thoughtful look before returning to her room. Inside, she finds Colin sitting on the bed's edge, wearing a fresh, unbuttoned shirt.",

Desi then engages with a middle-aged man.\n\nIn a backyard, Debbie's youngest child performs a flip on a trampoline while Debbie and Sadie watch attentively. Meanwhile, Pete, sitting on a toilet, is absorbed in an online game of Scrabble. The moment is interrupted when Debbie opens the door, raises her eyebrow skeptically, snatches his tablet, and exits.\n\nLater, Pete takes the stage for a performance. In the audience, his goateed friend and Barb sit at a table alongside Debbie. A silver-haired man wearing amber-tinted glasses joins Pete on stage with a backup musician. At the table, Pete sits next to his wife, his gaze intensely focused on the stage with boyish fervor. Debbie lets out a sigh. The music producer, bobbing his head, mouths the lyrics. Debbie discreetly turns away to yawn, prompting Pete to briefly lip-sync towards her. Debbie's eyes then close.\n\nAfterwards, Pete drives his wife home. He pulls over to let a fire truck pass by in the opposite direction. Debbie smirks as two more emergency vehicles follow suit. Once home, they enter Sadie's room. Debbie takes Sadie's MP3 player, places it in a dock, and begins to dance, bringing a smile to Sadie's face. Charlotte starts bouncing enthusiastically, and Sadie, grinning, joins them, bobbing her head as she dances. Pete watches, then sits down, eventually standing to replace Sadie's music player with his own. Debbie and the girls stop dancing and watch Pete as he sways awkwardly, his head rocking from side to side. Debbie points towards their daughters, who appear glum-faced. Pete, noticing their expressions, retrieves his music player from the dock.\n\nThe next morning, Debbie hurries to the kitchen island where Pete and the girls are eating breakfast. As she prepares their lunches, she shoots a glare at her husband. Later, Charlotte rushes upstairs. At school, Debbie and Charlotte walk past a pregnant woman with long, gray hair before reaching a classroom, where Debbie hugs an old woman.\n\nLater, Debbie is seen ducking down in her car, smoking a cigarette. She exhales smoke out the window and drives away. A laptop screen then displays footage of a young Graham Parker performing at the peak of his career. Pete watches this with a mustached 30-something and a hip, young woman, occasionally glancing towards his office. In the office, Graham departs.\n\nIn a home office setting, Pete strums a sitar. That night, Debbie and Pete are lounging in bed, watching a laptop. They view video footage from the store that shows Desi being intimate with someone. Debbie looks away and hits Pete with a pillow.\n\nFinally, Charlotte is seen bouncing in the doorway between the girls' bathroom. She playfully snatches herself out of view, collapsing with her feet still visible.",

Pete, legs spread wide, fixes his gaze on her intensely. After a fleeting glance, she turns and walks away. He then shifts to a sitting position.\n\nIn a bustling boutique, Debbie keeps an eye on Desi, who is busy folding clothes alongside Jodi. Her attention momentarily shifts back to Desi. Jodi's gaze tracks their movements. Debbie then saunters over to where Desi is standing. Desi reaches out and selects a brown top from a rack, then moves toward a dressing area. There, she removes her top. Debbie, stepping forward, reaches out and firmly grasps Desi's breast, squeezing it, then jiggling both breasts.\n\nAt his workplace, Pete receives a phone call. The scene transitions to a backyard where Sadie and a friend chase after the triplets, who then follow Charlotte out of the kitchen. Spotting his father, Pete turns away. Debbie offers a reassuring nod. Pete shifts his focus to Sadie's tablet, showing it to her. He then picks up his phone. The setting changes to another room where Pete concludes his call. Driving with a scowl, Pete has Sadie riding shotgun, singing with joyous abandon, while Charlotte bounces excitedly in the backseat. Pete's eyes roll in response.\n\nIn an office setting, Debbie sits opposite a man dressed in a shirt and tie. Meanwhile, Pete storms into Unfiltered Records, his scowl deepening as he nears a private office where he sees Ronnie drawing on a chalkboard wall. Pete steps inside with a scowl, then marches out.\n\nBack in an office, Debbie faces her gynecologist. Her head cocks to the side, her mouth twitching slightly as she stares, head tilted. Her gaze drops sorrowfully as she rubs her throat with her fingers. The doctor's smile fades away. Fighting back tears, Debbie nods and then shakes her head. Her eyes lift upward as she massages her brow and throat, then gently strokes her forehead.\n\nAs sunlight glints off Debbie's long, golden blonde hair, she drives, a pout forming as she lifts her chin and leans back against the headrest. She takes a deep breath, props her elbow on the windowsill, and rubs her knuckles against her temple. A smile begins to form, but she presses her lips together and blinks back tears. Finally, gripping the steering wheel with both hands, she allows a hopeful smile to emerge.\n\nIn his office, Pete sits at his desk, a glower fixed on his face. He presses his lips together, then moves to a wall and removes a framed piece of artwork. Clutching the crude pen and ink drawing, he stands at his father's front door.\n\nOn a stage, kids are busy painting a set while Sadie's parents watch from the back row. Debbie's eyes lock onto him intently. The school's outdoor walkways are filled with bustling kids around Sadie's age. Walking down a more secluded path, Debbie spots a blonde boy with a prop. She steps closer to him.",

From a distance, Barb casts a glance towards the pool. Debbie, too, notices Desi's presence.\n\nThe men, noticing their wives, wave at them amiably. Pete then shifts his attention to greeting the arriving guests and receiving their gifts. He later stands with Ronnie, another friend. In a swift move, Jason turns Debbie around, his gaze fixed intensely on Pete. Ronnie, on the other hand, looks off into the distance. The group quickly departs, with Jason moving to stand beside Ronnie. They exchange smiles that hint at awkwardness. Their attention shifts as they spot Desi swimming.\n\nDebbie opens the door to welcome her father, who enters with a furrowed brow. Pete looks down at a box he's holding and breaks into a smile. At the buffet line, Barb's husband turns to address Debbie's father. Larry extends his hand in greeting. As Desi and her group of friends approach, Larry warmly embraces Desi. He then shifts his attention to Oliver, eyeing him carefully. Charlotte reaches out and takes Oliver's hand. Debbie gives them a meaningful look.\n\nIn the pool, Desi swims gracefully in slow motion underwater. Jason and Ronnie swim alongside each other, converging at the center with her. Desi resurfaces, followed closely by the two men, who emerge from the water next to each other. They face one another, and Jason locks eyes with Desi. She smiles while treading water, then turns and swims away. Jason and Ronnie exchange a quick glance and swim after her.\n\nAt the party, Larry stands with Oliver, who winks and takes a bite of his food. Jason and Ronnie join Desi at a table, where she leans back and smiles. At another table, Larry nods, his gaze shifting to Pete and Debbie. Pete nods in acknowledgment, aligning himself with Debbie. With Desi, Ronnie and Jason share a moment, Ronnie's eyes darting between them. Debbie shoots a piercing look at Pete, prompting him to pause and look around at everyone.

Oliver nods at Pete, and Barb looks down, seemingly lost in thought.\n\nThe mood lifts as Graham Parker leads the guests in song. Pete smiles at his wife before leaning towards an electric guitar-shaped cake. She responds with a slight tilt of her head and a small grin. Oliver catches her gaze momentarily. Nearby, Larry's triplets playfully attack the cake, licking the frosting from the tuning pegs.\n\nThe atmosphere changes as Debbie, seeking solitude, hides behind some bushes, a cigarette dangling from her lips as she desperately tries to light it. Sadie appears around the corner, startling her mother. Startled, Debbie drops her cigarette and heads back to the house. She confronts Pete, her arms raised in frustration. Sadie watches in disbelief as her mother storms away. In a fit of anger, Pete throws his half-eaten cupcake against the kitchen wall and rushes past his daughters towards Debbie. Oliver exits past Debbie, prompting her to follow him out, staring at him in disbelief.\n\nThe scene shifts as Pete, donning a helmet and yellow-tinted sunglasses, rides his bike across the front lawn.

    "1028": "The movie opens with nature's spectacle as a wave powerfully crashes against a rock in a tranquil bay. Sunlight pierces through the dispersing clouds, illuminating the transition from majestic mountains to a dense forest where a bell tower emerges, soaring above the treetops. The sky, painted with fluffy white clouds on a vibrant blue canvas, stretches endlessly above. The scene then pans down to reveal the diverse tapestry of the United States landscape, featuring lush mountains, bustling cities, and expansive agricultural fields.\n\nThe screen suddenly splits, introducing more aerial perspectives. A coastal city comes into view, followed by a freeway slicing through lush green parkland. A meandering river winds its way across the scenery, while circular fields dot the landscape below. The camera shifts to snow-capped mountains before focusing on a jagged, rocky coastline.\n\nThe tranquility is broken as a jet descends for landing on the runway. A thick-set man in a suit is briefly seen before the scene shifts to Steve, who is busy clearing a table, shredding documents, pouring bleach into a coffee jar, and aiming a rifle at his office. The camera then cuts to Ryan Bingham, a man in his late 40s, sitting suavely with neatly graying hair styled in a side parting. Steve hands over his key card as they stand at the door.\n\nIn a hotel room, Ryan meticulously packs his suitcase, displaying a level of precision reminiscent of military training. He carefully studies a pouch full of ties, closes it, and secures it within the case. With a final zip and a pull of the handle, he drags the suitcase out of the room, flicking off the light as he exits.\n\nAt the airport, Ryan efficiently returns his rental car and heads directly to the First Class priority access desk. He quickly obtains his boarding pass and proceeds to the security area, where he places his case on a table and retrieves two gray plastic trays. Into these, he methodically places his laptop, shoes, and suit jacket. He then strides confidently through the metal detector, boarding pass in hand, and is promptly checked by a uniformed security officer. After donning his jacket and shoes, zipping up his case, and extending its handle, Ryan continues on his way.\n\nA jet is seen soaring over a sea of fluffy white clouds. Inside, Ryan is comfortably seated in First Class, observing a flight attendant as she navigates the aisle with her trolley, serving drinks to passengers.

A smile then crosses his face as the plane begins its descent.\n\nRyan is next seen unzipping a backpack and taking his place behind a lectern, addressing a sparse group of delegates seated at long tables. His smile is brief but noticeable. At the airport once more, Ryan approaches a desk marked by a sign, presenting a card for verification.

Natalie captures the image, then hands the camera to Ryan before briskly walking away, leaving him in a state of disbelief. The scene shifts to Wichita.\n\nIn a conference room, Ryan and Natalie sit across from a young man. In a sudden burst of anger, he snatches the strategy packet, forcefully pushes his chair aside, and storms out. A young woman is briefly seen. Ryan then follows Natalie outside to a bench where she sits, looking disturbed. Facing her, Ryan's concern is evident as he frowns. Her nods are stiff, betraying her unease.\n\nAn American Airlines jet, adorned in its striking red, white, and blue livery, accelerates down the runway and ascends into the sky.

The receptionist watches them enter with tears in her eyes. Natalie surveys the sparse environment, her discomfort subtly apparent. The narrative shifts to another flight, arriving in Tulsa.\n\nIn a hotel lobby, Ryan waits while Natalie is engrossed in a phone call. A quick frown and sharp turn from Ryan lead him to check his reflection in a nearby mirror. In separate offices, Ryan and Natalie sit with various employees, who are reviewing their strategy packets.\n\nOutside another hotel room, Ryan attempts to use one of his key cards to enter, but it fails, prompting him to discard it. Successfully using another card, he and Alex enter the room. Back on a flight, Ryan hands Natalie an American Airlines Priority Access application form and a pen, which she hesitantly accepts. A wide river cuts through a cityscape.\n\nRyan and Natalie meet with several employees. An old man lets out a brief sigh. Ryan later finds Natalie in a room filled with office chairs; she stands, holding her coat, and they exit past a car rental office. Above Miami, a few small clouds drift across a clear sky, contrasting with the deep blue of the ocean. A jet descends, ready to land.\n\nRyan delivers an inspiring speech, a thoughtful smile playing on his lips. Natalie observes from the back of the conference room.

    "1034": "Natalie turns and departs, while Ryan gazes out the window of an ascending airplane. In Las Vegas, Alex positions a cut-out of Julie and Jim before the pyramid-shaped Luxor Hotel. Ryan readies his digital camera as Alex adjusts the cut-out's position. He snaps a photo, then gazes at the cut-out. Ryan's smile broadens, and Natalie appears startled. Alex's smile radiates warmth.\n\nIn Milwaukee, an airplane descends for landing. Alex and Ryan navigate through the airport terminal, each pulling their wheelie cases—Ryan's black, Alex's a tidy red. They later enter the Swiss lodge-themed Chalet Suites hotel, joining a brief check-in queue. Ryan spots another counter without a wait. As he opens their hotel room door, his sister Kara approaches carrying a laundry basket. The duo steps into their flamboyantly decorated room, where Ryan lifts a photocopied booklet displaying Julie and Jim on its cover. Julie embraces Ryan as Jim approaches. A large U.S. map adorns the wall, adorned with photos of Julie and Jim's cut-out at various iconic locations. Ryan steps back to survey the photo-laden map, a thoughtful smile playing on his lips before rejoining Alex, Julie, and Jim. He gestures towards the map.\n\nAt the bar, Alex returns indoors while Ryan lingers outside with Julie and Kara, their smiles shared. Julie nods, her expression turning sorrowful as she gazes downward. A box of floral arrangements is present. Kara observes Julie.\n\nRyan drives to his old school, he and Alex exiting the vehicle. They survey the long, low building, then trudge through snow to the entrance. Ryan attempts the door, finding it locked. He peers into the darkened interior, then turns to Alex with resignation. She grins, moves to a window, and uses a credit card to unfasten a latch, opening it. Ryan helps hoist her up by her foot, and they both clamber into a classroom. Inside, they examine old newspaper photos of the basketball team and a picture in a trophy case. Outside near a loading bay, they sit on stairs and share a kiss. In the gym, they watch the basketball team's practice, exchanging grins. Kara's call interrupts.\n\nAlex drops Ryan off at a church. Ryan rushes to the church's entrance, opens the door, and ascends stairs. Entering, he finds Julie, clad in white, seated among her cerise-clad bridesmaids, tears streaming down her face.

Inside, Jim, dressed in suit trousers, a white shirt, and a maroon waistcoat, is engrossed in reading a children's book. Ryan, turning to Kara, sees her raise her eyebrows, urging him to enter. Jim notices and looks up from his book. As Ryan closes the door, his eyes scan the room before he takes a seat and shrugs. Jim responds with a nod and a raised eyebrow, prompting Ryan to smile. Observing from outside, Kara smiles as well.\n\nKara then leads Jim into another room where Julie, surrounded by bridesmaids offering comfort, sits. Jim approaches Julie, kneels, and gently takes her hands in his. A smile spreads across Julie's face as she nods, and they embrace warmly. From the doorway, Kara watches and exchanges a glance with Ryan.\n\nMeanwhile, an usher distributes the order of service to the guests as they settle into their seats at the church. In the vestry, Alex assists Ryan in donning his suit. Together, Ryan and Alex observe from their seats as the flower girls proceed down the aisle. Jim stands ready alongside the bridesmaids, and everyone turns to watch as Julie, escorted by Jim's uncle, walks gracefully down the aisle. Julie and Jim approach the priest, who officiates their wedding ceremony. The congregation rises as Jim lovingly places the wedding ring on Julie's finger, her face beaming with joy. Seated, Ryan holds Alex's hand. Julie and Jim light candles, and Jim lifts her veil before they share a tender kiss, met with applause from all attendees.\n\nThe newlyweds then walk back up the aisle, arm-in-arm, with Julie playfully waving her bouquet. Everyone gathers outside for photographs. At the reception, Julie and Jim dance together, surrounded by guests ringing tiny wedding bells. Alex and Ryan, sharing smiles and laughter, also join the dance floor. Julie and Ryan dance cheek-to-cheek, and the dance floor becomes increasingly crowded. Alex and Ryan dance together; Ryan pulls a goofy face and falls back into Alex's arms, and they play pat-a-cake. Ryan then adopts a serious expression and waggles his arms while Alex shimmies side to side. Amidst the festivities, Julie tosses her bouquet over her shoulder, which one of the bridesmaids catches. As the evening winds down, Alex and Ryan share a slow dance.\n\nAs the guests begin to depart, Alex and Ryan sit together. Ryan picks up a bouquet of flowers and hands it to Alex, who bursts into laughter. Ryan helps Alex with her jacket, and they leave together. In the hotel elevator, they share a kiss.\n\nThe next day, at the airport, Alex and Ryan stand facing each other with their wheelie cases, both smiling. However, Alex's smile momentarily falters as she walks away toward her departure gate. Ryan watches her go.\n\nUpon returning to Omaha, Ryan walks down the hall and enters his apartment. He pauses to survey the sparse white room before opening a closet door and hanging up some shirts. In the bathroom, he places his toothbrush into a glass. Later, with Natalie, Ryan walks along a line of cubicles where workers engage in video link conversations.",
    "1036": "Ryan, momentarily distracted, dons a headset while seated before his computer. He then finds himself in a meeting with Craig and other colleagues, reviewing the schedule for the upcoming Gold Quest Conference on his laptop. Later, at home, Ryan retrieves a couple of whiskey miniatures from his refrigerator. With a drink in hand, he gazes out of his window, lost in thought.\n\nA large video screen outside a Las Vegas hotel showcases an event caption, setting the stage for Ryan's next appearance. He waits backstage at a crowded conference hall, where he places his backpack on a table, dons a smart suit, and steps up to the lectern. Behind him, screens display rotating computer-generated backpacks. Scanning the room full of seated delegates, Ryan briefly hangs his head and shakes it slightly before looking up with a self-assured smile. He taps his thumb on the lectern, then walks off past a backstage attendant and exits the building.\n\nIn a rush, Ryan dashes through an airport, his boarding pass fluttering in one hand as he drags his suitcase with the other. He reaches his departure gate, gets his pass checked, and boards his flight. On the jet, he gazes out of the window at the nighttime lights of Chicago. Upon landing, in a snowy flurry, Ryan picks up a Hertz rental car, signs the paperwork, and drives off. Navigating through slush-covered roads, he glances at a piece of paper in his hand, scanning the streets until he pulls up to a large suburban townhouse. He rings the doorbell, steps back, and attempts to appear casual with his hands in the pockets of his long black coat.\n\nAlex opens the door, and Ryan's cheeky smile fades as he notices two young boys dashing up the stairs behind her. Mortified, Alex stares at Ryan, who slowly backs away as she shuts the door. Ryan turns and leaves, retreating to a hotel room where he sits staring out into the night, sipping a large whiskey. His solitary figure is framed by one of the tall windows in the nondescript hotel block.\n\nRyan returns to the airport, dragging his suitcase through the bustling terminal. He checks in at a self-service kiosk, swipes his card, and takes the shuttle train to his gate, where he sits on the edge of a seat, looking morose. Amidst his reflection, Alex calls him from her car. Ryan, visibly tearful, struggles with his emotions as tears well up in his eyes. He opens his mouth to speak but, overwhelmed, shuts his eyes and hangs up, his expression deeply hurt. On his subsequent flight, Ryan sits staring into space, lost in thought, until a stewardess hands him a glass of champagne.",

Meanwhile, in the stairwell, Javier glances at his watch, timing his next move. As chaos ensues, an ambulance races through the streets with Sam communicating via its radio. A Secret Service agent descends the stairs, only to be swiftly shot by Javier. Javier continues his descent, observing additional agents passing below him before cautiously proceeding downward.\n\nSimultaneously, Sam maneuvers the ambulance at a breakneck pace through the city streets. On the seventh level, Javier stealthily opens a door, dons a ski mask, and violently stabs an agent in the back as he lunges through the doorway. As another agent turns the corner, Javier launches an attack, quickly overpowering and killing him before drawing his weapon.\n\nThe ambulance, driven by Sam, causes havoc at a junction, leading to a collision between two other vehicles. Javier, using a mirror, spots two agents outside the President's room, and without hesitation, opens fire. He then shoots a third agent before setting charges that forcefully blow the door to the President's room. Javier swiftly enters, guns down Cavic, McCullough, and Heinkin, and then menacingly points his gun at Ashton.\n\nAs the ambulance reaches the scene of the bombed hotel, Veronica and Sam emerge from the vehicle. Sam briefly taps his cell phone screen before being led away by an agent to kneel beside a casualty. Meanwhile, Barnes enters the GNN OB truck, quickly flashing his ID. Veronica, pushing a gurney, enters the elevator and presses the button for the seventh floor. \n\nBarnes, inside the truck, makes a second call on his cell phone and spots Taylor on the monitor, disguised as a police officer. This sighting triggers a flashback of Taylor leaving Barnes and Howard. Taylor, with a smirk, runs off and enters an annex behind two agents just as a bomb detonates outside. Inside, Taylor ruthlessly guns down both agents, discards his jacket, and dismantles a remote-controlled rifle. He changes into a Spanish policeman's outfit and descends an external staircase with the rifle packed away.\n\nAs Taylor departs, Barnes, still monitoring, sees him on the screen, glaring intently before springing into action and rushing out of the GNN truck. Taylor cunningly places his cell phone in the front seat of the ambulance driven by Sam and Veronica and then gets into a Spanish police car. Barnes, following Taylor, rounds a corner onto a quiet street, witnessing Taylor speeding away. He gives chase on foot through a narrow pedestrian street and onto the main road, boldly rushing into oncoming traffic. Determined, Barnes commandeers a blue hatchback, quickly getting back on his cell phone as he slides around another corner.\n\nBack at the hotel, Javier forcefully escorts Ashton at gunpoint towards the elevator on the seventh floor. Veronica arrives in the elevator, promptly chloroforming Ashton. They then place the unconscious President on the gurney and re-enter the elevator, where Veronica carefully fits an oxygen mask onto Ashton's face. Throughout this, Javier keeps his gun menacingly pointed at the President's head.",
    "1039": "Sam notices the elevator is stuck on the seventh floor. Inside, a tense Javier, sweating profusely, glares at Veronica before lowering his gun momentarily. As Veronica starts to relax, Javier swiftly raises it again. She responds by shaking her head, leading Javier to relent. He exits the elevator, leaving Veronica inside, and as he walks down the corridor, he touches his stomach, his palm coming away bloody.\n\nJavier then descends the hotel's stairwell, now dressed in a Spanish policeman's uniform. Meanwhile, outside, Sam spots Veronica exiting the elevator with a covered gurney and rushes over to assist. Together, they wheel the gurney, with Veronica carefully managing the drip. The President, concealed beneath a blue blanket, lies on the gurney. After leaving the annex, Javier checks his watch on the street as Sam and Veronica maneuver the President's gurney towards an awaiting ambulance. Luis dashes up to them, quickly climbs into the ambulance, and Sam closes the door behind him. The ambulance departs amidst the chaos outside the hotel.\n\nInside the speeding hatchback, Barnes answers his cell phone, shifts gears, and skillfully navigates through the narrow streets. Simultaneously, Sam drives the ambulance, weaving through traffic on a different street. Inside the ambulance, Ashton, who was lying under the blanket, opens his eyes, lowers a sidebar, but as the ambulance turns a corner, he tumbles to the floor.\n\nElsewhere, Taylor speeds in a Spanish police car. In the ambulance, Veronica smiles at Sam, who is driving, until Enrique suddenly dashes across the road in front of them, exchanging a stunned glance with Veronica. Sam casts a shifty look towards Veronica, who then shoots Luis point blank. Ashton, cowering on the floor near the gurney, reaches for the drip support and disconnects a metal bar, clutching it to his chest.\n\nJavier confronts a couple entering their car, pulling out his gun. The middle-aged man nervously hands over his keys as Taylor, driving a Spanish police car, approaches and stops when Javier aggressively slaps the car's bonnet. Barnes, driving nearby, abruptly brakes, reverses, and spots Javier entering Taylor's police car. Determined, Barnes pursues them, his expression focused as he expertly drifts around corners and weaves through traffic close behind. He pulls out his cell phone, but a taxi collides with the side of his hatchback, sending his small blue car spinning along the road. With determination, Barnes regains control of the vehicle. Taylor looks back as Barnes shifts gears and accelerates after them. Taylor executes a power-slide around a corner with Barnes hot on his heels. Taylor gets on the radio.\n\nInside the ambulance, Sam anxiously glances over at Veronica, who grips her seat belt. Barnes dodges traffic, racing past pavements crowded with panicking pedestrians. In the police car, Javier fidgets anxiously in the passenger seat as policemen frantically direct frightened bystanders away from the chase as both cars barrel through a junction.",
    "1043": "Enrique approached a security checkpoint where a female officer was stationed. She signaled for the next person to proceed. As he waited, Enrique observed a couple whispering nearby. He continued to watch the young couple intently. As Enrique drew closer, the man with the short, cropped hair walked away, exchanging a glance with Enrique, who then approached the attractive, long-haired woman, Veronica. Seizing her hair, Enrique forcefully pushed her against a pillar. Veronica responded by holding his head, and as she embraced him, Enrique handed her a bag. Reluctantly, he released her hand, stepped back, and paused to look back at her. Veronica blew him a kiss in return. Enrique then proceeded to the security barrier, presented his ID, and was granted passage.\n\nInside, Enrique briskly walked past the podium where the Mayor was shaking hands with President Ashton. The Mayor then stepped up to the lectern as Spanish flags were waved enthusiastically by the crowd. Enrique, anxious, rubbed his palms together, reflecting on his encounter with Veronica. Meanwhile, the young man from the couple left Veronica's side. As the Mayor concluded his introduction, Enrique looked up just as President Ashton stepped forward, dramatically raising his arms at his sides. Suddenly, the President staggered and collapsed.\n\nReacting swiftly, Enrique leaped onto the podium and sprinted across it, only to be tackled by an agent named Barnes. Agents Matthews and Holden quickly intervened, leading Enrique away from the scene. A man in a checked shirt captured the incident on video. Amidst the chaos, Enrique spotted Veronica confidently moving through the crowd. He watched her intensely as she caught his gaze and maintained it. Enrique's eyes moved from her face to the bag he had passed to her through security. Veronica then tossed the bag under the podium.\n\nAs an agent attempted to lead Enrique away, he elbowed the agent in the face, seized his gun, and holstered it. Smoke began to fill the plaza. Enrique sat up and noticed Holden, who was near the fallen Matthews and beside Barnes, spotting him. Holden gave chase as Enrique rounded a corner, pursued by Holden and another agent. In an attempt to deter them, Holden fired a shot into the air. Enrique dashed into the street, narrowly avoiding an approaching ambulance in which Veronica was a passenger. Distracted, Enrique was struck by a car. He quickly regained his footing and continued to run.\n\nThe pursuit led Enrique and his pursuers, Holden and Parsons, into an arcade where Enrique shoved people aside to clear his path. He sprinted upstairs and into an apartment building, where residents on the staircase inadvertently delayed the secret service agents. Seizing the moment, Enrique ran onto a balcony, leaped into a courtyard below, and continued his escape. Holden and Parsons reached the balcony railing and raced along it in pursuit.\n\nEnrique dashed away from the apartment building, sprinting along the street while constantly checking over his shoulder. He dodged traffic as he crossed the road but was hit by another car. Undeterred, Enrique ran across a road to an underpass carrying highway traffic, continuing his desperate flight.",
    "1044": "Enrique, drenched in sweat on his face, arms, and hair, removes his gun from its holster and inspects the magazine. He then cocks the gun, preparing it for use. Stepping out from behind a pillar, he scans the road ahead, his gaze intense.\n\nThe narrative then rewinds, revisiting moments leading up to this point: Enrique cocking his gun, being struck by a car, spotting Veronica in an ambulance, Holden aiming a gun at him, an explosion occurring, and being tackled by Barnes along with the man Veronica was accompanying. The clock strikes noon.\n\nIn the bustling Plaza Mayor, surrounded by an agitated crowd with a helicopter hovering overhead, Howard Lewis, wearing a checked shirt, captures the scene on video. His camera pans across the upper windows and one of the plaza's many arches. Amidst the chaos, children on balconies shout greetings. Howard moves away from the kids, resuming his filming, his timer showing almost two hours and two minutes. He weaves deeper into the crowd, his camera aimed above their heads, capturing Veronica near a pillar with the young man Enrique had seen her with. Howard zooms in just as Veronica places an item in the young man's hand and they clasp palms, their heads drawing near. Howard averts his gaze and stops recording momentarily before resuming.\n\nA short man approaches Howard as a little girl bumps into him, smudging him with her ice cream. The girl, named Anna, begins to sob as her mother pulls her away, though she casts a lingering glance back. Howard bends down, asking her name.\n\nAlerted by applause, Howard switches his camera back to record mode. President Ashton ascends the podium and shakes hands with the Mayor. As the Mayor moves to the lectern, Howard advances, his eyes glued to his LCD screen, grinning. His camera captures Barnes looking up and speaking into a cuff microphone. Howard quickly turns his camera towards a moving curtain, spotting a shadowy figure behind it. He keeps his camera on this figure, then pivots as shots ring out and President Ashton is hit. Howard continues recording as Holden and Matthews rush to the President's aid, while the crowd recoils from the podium.\n\nHoward captures Enrique jumping onto the podium, followed by Barnes tackling him. Amidst the turmoil, Howard also films Veronica throwing her bag under the podium before she escapes. The crowd becomes increasingly agitated upon hearing a distant explosion. In the ensuing panic, Anna loses her grip on her mother's hand, and people flee, some trampling over others who have fallen.\n\nThroughout the chaos, Howard remains focused, continuing to videotape and eventually using his cell phone.",
    "1046": "Holden and Parson unleash a barrage of gunfire across the highway. Howard, in a frantic escape, shifts the camera focus back to Enrique. An officer bends over Enrique, tenderly raising his head. Howard then notices Anna stepping onto the highway, causing a white car to swerve sharply to avoid her. An ambulance rushes over the hill bridge. Howard sprints along the highway towards Anna but freezes mid-road as the ambulance speeds dangerously close to her. In a desperate attempt, Howard races towards her. Suddenly, the scene pauses and reverses, showing Enrique catapulting off a red sedan's windshield. Howard sweeps Anna into his arms as a fiery explosion recedes into nothingness, enveloping the scene in darkness.\n\nMeanwhile, marksmen monitor from the rooftops of high buildings as President Ashton's motorcade advances towards the plaza. Inside the motorcade, Ashton is on a car phone, with Cavic and another agent seated across from him. The motorcade stops under a bridge, allowing a dark-suited man, Ted Heinkin, to enter Ashton's car. Heinkin hangs up the phone Ashton was using, narrows his eyes, removes two flags from the limousine's hood, and then forcefully shuts a folder after inserting a document. Ashton gazes solemnly out the window at the seething crowd filling Plaza Mayor, where protesters wave placards and an inflatable skull with skeleton hands.\n\nThe motorcade of Ashton's double passes beneath the vigilant snipers. The President's limo proceeds into the hotel's underground car park. Government agents stand guard outside the glass wall of Hotel Vesta. In a bright, empty parking lot speckled with armed agents, President Ashton exits his limo, followed by Heinkin and silver-haired Phil McCullough into an elevator. An agent in a suit swipes a card and communicates via radio. Inside the elevator, Ashton studies large photographs from a folder while McCullough shifts uncomfortably, avoiding eye contact. Ashton, giving McCullough a penetrating look, steps out of the elevator, followed by Heinkin, who raises an eyebrow as they proceed down a corridor.\n\nAt the plaza, the crowd waves Spanish flags as Secret Service agents escort Ashton's double to a red-carpeted podium. In his hotel room, Ashton opens the curtains and looks out towards Plaza Mayor. Secret Service agents position themselves around the President on the podium where De Soto stands at the lectern. Ashton watches his double on television until the double is shot. McCullough quickly grabs the phone. Ashton watches live footage of Barnes tackling Enrique, remaining transfixed before turning away.",
    "1048": "Sam, upon spotting Howard with his camera, narrows his eyes and pensively furrows his brow before approaching him. Meanwhile, Javier stands inside an elevator, staring at a CCTV camera. He exits on the fourth floor, walks down a corridor, and uses a swipe card to unlock a hotel room door. Inside, he retrieves a hold-all from the fridge, extracts a pistol, loads it, and inserts an earpiece.\n\nIn the plaza, Sam observes Veronica taking a bag from Enrique, then notices a marksman. He watches Enrique leave before blending into the crowd. At the same time, Howard converses with Anna.\n\nJavier, now wearing a backpack, ascends a hotel staircase while attaching a silencer to his pistol. He activates a fan in a window overlooking the plaza using a touchscreen PDA, causing the curtain to flutter, which is noticed by Barnes. Sam turns away and leaves the scene.\n\nWith his pistol drawn, Javier navigates the hotel corridors, shooting a hotel maid, causing a gun to fall from her hand. He approaches another room, touches his earpiece, and attempts to use a key card. Meanwhile, Sam, amidst the crowd, manipulates his phone, which communicates with a receiver in a high window. This triggers a rifle on a motorized tripod to rotate, relaying its view to Sam's device. Sam uses the phone to direct the rifle at Ashton's double, who is approaching a podium with his arm outstretched. Sam taps the screen, and the gun fires, killing Ashton's double and causing the crowd to scatter. Taylor then squats beside the fallen double.\n\nJavier enters the hotel's CCTV control room, shoots the security guards, unplugs a laptop, and makes a call on his cell phone. Sam, in turn, enters numbers into his phone. Javier loads a cartridge into his pistol and removes his beige jacket, while Barnes communicates via radio.\n\nFelipe, standing by his open locker, gently touches a family photo before closing it. He then gazes at his reflection in a mirror, revealing dynamite strapped around his waist. He conceals it under his bellboy jacket and nervously enters the hotel corridor. At the same time, Sam loads a pistol and hands it to Veronica, who is dressing in a nurse's uniform. She accepts it. In another room, Javier's brother, bound and gagged with gaffer tape, sits against a white pillow. Veronica points the pistol at him, but Sam quickly shoots, startling her.\n\nJavier races up a hotel stairwell and checks his watch. Felipe, meanwhile, crosses the bustling hotel lobby. In a garage, Sam uses a stylus to interact with his cell phone's screen.",
    "1050": "In a tense atmosphere, Mrs. Bennet exchanges knowing winks with Kitty and Lizzie, subtly gesturing towards Jane and Mr. Bingley. Confused, Kitty looks between Jane and her mother before nodding to Mr. Bingley and exiting the room alongside Mary and Kitty. Once they depart, Mr. Bingley settles back into his seat. Lizzie, maintaining a casual demeanor, picks up her embroidery and angles herself to give Mr. Bingley and Jane some privacy. Later, she sets her embroidery aside, smiles warmly at Mr. Bingley, and exits the room, casting a cautionary glance at Jane as she goes. Mr. Bingley, appearing nervous, looks down at Jane, who eventually meets his gaze with a shy lift of her eyes.\n\nMeanwhile, Mrs. Bennet and the other girls wait anxiously in another room, with Mrs. Bennet wearing a smug look. Shortly after, Lizzie is seen quietly descending the stairs and then stealthily approaching the parlor door. Upon entering, she finds Jane and Mr. Bingley standing by the mantelpiece. Mr. Bingley whispers something to Jane before departing. Lizzie immediately turns to her sister, kisses her on the cheek, and then leaves the room, her broad smile transforming into one of contented relief once out of sight.\n\nA little later, Mr. Bennet and the family bid farewell to Mr. Bingley. He exchanges a brief smile with Jane before mounting his white horse. Mrs. Bennet waves her handkerchief as he rides away, with Mr. Bennet standing beside Jane. As the family heads indoors, Jane lingers momentarily before linking arms with Lizzie and walking inside together.\n\nSoon, an elegant carriage arrives at Longbourn, drawn by four horses and accompanied by lively footmen. Spotting this, Kitty rushes back to the house. Inside the carriage are Lady Catherine de Bourgh and her daughter Anne. Mrs. Bennet and Lizzie, alerted by Kitty's pointing, rush to the window to see. As Lady Catherine enters, she is greeted with curtsies from Lizzie, Kitty, and Mrs. Bennet. With a haughty air, Lady Catherine proceeds to sit down, leaving the others standing and filled with expectant unease.\n\nLady Catherine then exits, followed by a puzzled Lizzie. They move into a less tended part of the garden, with Lady Catherine leading the way to a clearing under a tree, flanked by two small stone benches. She turns to face Lizzie, her face flooding with relief. Without further ado, she climbs back into her carriage, leaving Lizzie struggling to contain her anger as the carriage pulls away. Lizzie watches it depart, her face revealing little, before she turns and heads back inside.",
    "1052": "Lizzie and the Gardiners journey through the undulating landscapes of the Peaks. Meanwhile, Darcy hones his fencing skills. In a separate encounter, they shake hands and Baines departs. Lizzie carefully navigates her way over the rocky summit of a hill, observed by the Gardiners from the base of the incline. She surveys the surrounding countryside. That evening, the trio enjoys a meal together. Mrs. Gardiner glances at Lizzie, who responds with a smile.\n\nThe following day, their open-topped carriage advances through the verdant countryside toward Pemberley, crossing a small, single-arched bridge over a stream. Inside the carriage, Lizzie and Mrs. Gardiner sit opposite Mr. Gardiner as it proceeds through sunlit woods. Suddenly, the grandeur of Pemberley emerges, leaving Lizzie breathless at the sight of the stately, classical mansion. She nods and smiles broadly as the carriage passes under a grand, ornate archway into Pemberley's grounds.\n\nInside, a housekeeper showcases a beautiful mahogany writing desk to them before leading the group into the next room. The housekeeper then turns her attention to Lizzie, who walks to a window and gazes out at the mirror-like lake at the lawn's edge. They see a portrait of a thoughtful Georgiana seated, and a miniature of a rather haughty young man. Ascending a grand, white staircase, the tour continues.\n\nOutside, a white horse canters along a wooded path with Darcy elegantly mounted, wearing a top hat and frock coat. From a hilltop, he halts to peer through the trees at Pemberley, breathing deeply as if pondering a decision. Suddenly, he spurs the horse into a gallop. Near a lake, he dismounts quickly, removes his hat, and begins to unbutton his coat.\n\nThe tour inside Pemberley continues into a magnificent long hall, lined with paintings on one side and windows on the other. The housekeeper pauses in front of a painting, which Lizzie looks at intently—it's a proud portrait of Darcy. Outside, Darcy, now having removed his frock coat, lays it on the grass, sits, and loosens his cravat. His dark hair curls with sweat as he unbuttons and removes his waistcoat.\n\nInside, Lizzie remains fixated on Darcy's portrait. Meanwhile, at the lake's edge, Darcy, now in just breeches and a loose white shirt, steels himself and dives into the murky, green water, swimming with long, effortless strokes. Back inside, Lizzie's attention shifts to the formal gardens, admiring their orderly beauty.",
    "1053": "Darcy strides purposefully towards Pemberley, his wet shirt clinging tightly to his muscular frame. Behind him, his groom leads the horse, but soon they part ways, the groom heading off in one direction while Darcy continues on his path. Emerging from the trees into a field adorned with vibrant buttercups, Darcy descends the hill towards the expansive lake that fronts Pemberley, its stately architecture mirroring perfectly in the tranquil waters. \n\nMeanwhile, Lizzie, absorbed in her thoughts, also makes her way towards the lake. Suddenly, she turns to see Darcy emerging from the woods, advancing towards her. He halts abruptly, then offers a formal bow before continuing his journey just as the Gardiners descend the hill towards a somewhat disconcerted Lizzie.\n\nQuickening his pace, Darcy hurries down steps into the courtyard, hastily donning his coat. He pauses briefly, deliberating over which direction to take, before decisively marching through an archway to catch up with Lizzie. After a brief interaction, he moves on, and Mrs. Gardiner links arms with Lizzie, and they follow Darcy and Mr. Gardiner, who are a few steps ahead. As they pause to admire the view, Lizzie remains slightly behind. Darcy approaches her, leaving the Gardiners to revel in the beauty of the landscape, and together, he and Lizzie continue walking, her gaze carefully averted from him. The group proceeds through the trees, with Lizzie and Darcy maintaining a considerate distance ahead of the Gardiners.\n\nLater, Darcy courteously assists Lizzie into her carriage. As it pulls away, he remains standing, watching until it disappears from sight, while Lizzie turns to see him diminishing in the distance.\n\nA delicate hand meticulously works on a piece of floral embroidery, set against a backdrop of wind-sculpted rocks and the expansive beauty of the Peak District that stretches endlessly to the horizon. Lizzie is seen walking along a narrow, cobbled street when a young woman leans out from a top window of a building, catching her attention as she passes below. Surprised, Lizzie enters a nearby building and heads directly to the parlor where Mr. Darcy awaits her. Upon her entrance, he rises promptly from his seat, bows in greeting, and Lizzie responds with a curtsy. Darcy then gestures towards a young woman standing across the room, whom Lizzie approaches. The two ladies exchange curtsies, and Mr. Darcy, acknowledging the interaction with a nod, exits the room. Lizzie looks at Georgiana and offers a warm smile.\n\nThe arrival of Mr. Bingley interrupts the scene, prompting Georgiana to curtsy and leave them alone. That evening, Mr. Darcy gazes adoringly at Lizzie as she entertains a gathering of guests in the drawing room with her piano playing and singing. Among the attentive audience are Mr. Bingley, the Gardiners, Louisa Hurst, and Miss Bingley, the latter displaying a distinctly sour expression.",
    "1054": "At a gathering, Mr. Gardiner offers a smile towards Mr. Darcy. Nearby, Georgiana stands beside Lizzie, glancing down at her before both turn their attention to Mr. Darcy. Lizzie rises, arranging music for Georgiana before crossing the room. Miss Bingley intercepts her, prompting Mr. Darcy to sit up straighter. Embarrassed, Lizzie quickly returns to Georgiana's side. As she slowly lifts her eyes to meet Mr. Darcy's across the room, he watches her, utterly captivated. Their gaze holds, filled with warmth and mutual understanding.\n\nAs dusk settles, a carriage departs from Pemberley, with Mr. Bingley, Mr. Darcy, and Georgiana bidding farewell. Mr. Bingley and Georgiana then proceed arm in arm into the house, while Mr. Darcy lingers on the doorstep, observing the carriage as it rolls down the winding driveway. Shortly after, Mr. Darcy and Mr. Bingley re-enter the drawing room, where Mrs. Hurst and Miss Bingley await. Mr. Darcy fixes Miss Bingley with a piercing stare, causing her to avert her eyes.\n\nLater, Mr. Darcy moves through the grand, portrait-filled hall of Pemberley, a candle in hand guiding his way, with two dogs trailing behind. He enters the now-darkened drawing room, setting the candle on the mantelpiece and leaning against the fireplace, seemingly lost in thought. His gaze drifts to the piano where Lizzie had played earlier, his expression softening as he recalls her looking up at him, a memory etched in time.\n\nThe following day, a grey and misty dawn breaks over Pemberley. As Darcy prepares in front of his mirror, his butler presents his frock coat, which he dons before galloping across the estate on his white horse, impeccably dressed in a bottle-green frock coat, cream breeches, riding boots, and a top hat. With a gentle tap of the whip, he urges his horse up a grassy hill.\n\nIn Lambton, the maid enters to find Lizzie and the Gardiners. Mr. Gardiner opens the door, and they leave, leaving Lizzie alone with her letters. She opens the first one just as a messenger arrives at another location, dismounting his horse. In his night attire, Mr. Bennet calmly answers the door, receives a letter from the messenger, hands off his candle to the housekeeper, and reads the letter. Tears well up in Lizzie's eyes as she reads.\n\nMeanwhile, Wickham turns to Lydia. Lizzie, anxious, opens another letter, then rushes to the door as Mr. Darcy enters. The maid appears, and Mr. Darcy sits, taking Lizzie's hand as she breaks down in tears.",
    "1057": "She returns indoors, examining an unopened letter, and proceeds to knock on Mr. Bennet's study door. She enters and presents the letter to him. Mr. Bennet waits until the housekeeper exits before placing the letter on his desk. The housekeeper then heads to the garden to gather the laundry.\n\nMeanwhile, Jane and Lizzie are engaged in fruit picking. Suddenly, Lizzie abandons her basket and dashes off, with Jane closely following. They race around the house and over the lawn in search of their father. They catch sight of him, hands clasped behind him, wandering thoughtfully under the trees. They hasten to his side.\n\nLizzie then sits to read the letter, her expression shifting to one of disturbance as she stands. Later, in Jane's bedroom, clad in her nightgown, Lizzie sits despondently on the stool at the bed's foot. Jane, nearby, dries her hair by the fire. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy's face is set in resolute determination, and in another scene, a lady meticulously works on floral embroidery. With a heavy heart, Lizzie heads back to her father's study, pauses to observe him through the doorway, and then steps inside. He turns, takes her hand, and together they listen to Mrs. Bennet's frenzied conversation.\n\nThe scene shifts to a grand building with a pillared portico. An open-topped carriage, drawn by two white horses, arrives. Lydia steps out, attired in a simple empire line wedding dress and bonnet, clutching a bouquet. Accompanied by the Gardiners, she joyfully takes Mr. Gardiner's hand and ascends the steps. Inside, Mr. Wickham rises, prepared to welcome his bride, with Mr. Darcy standing beside him, his face tense with anger. Lydia proceeds down the aisle, smiling broadly, and joins Mr. Wickham at the altar. The vicar steps forward to officiate.\n\nLater, another open-topped carriage arrives at Longbourn, carrying Mr. and Mrs. Wickham. The Bennet family steps out to welcome them, with Mrs. Bennet excitedly waving a white handkerchief overhead. She takes Mr. Bennet's arm, leading the way, as Jane moves to follow. Jane and Lizzie share a look before entering the house, with Mary and Kitty trailing behind.\n\nSubsequently, the girls are seen on a walk. Nearby, Mr. Wickham flaunts his equestrian prowess, cantering past and leaping his horse over a log, then passing them again as Lydia flashes a mischievous grin at her sisters. Lizzie appears contemplative. Meanwhile, Mr. Gardiner extends his hand to finalize a deal.\n\nWickham later encounters Lizzie while she is reading the letter. She turns away, feeling embarrassed. They then walk together in Longbourn's gardens.",
    "1060": "Jenny beams with joy as she surveys the opulent hall, her eyes catching the glow of the table lamps. Meanwhile, Helen and Danny share a glance filled with concern. David's gaze shifts to Jenny, causing her to freeze momentarily. As the singer concludes, Jenny claps with delight, her smile radiant. Her attention remains fixed on the stage. Nearby, Danny and Helen engage in conversation. Jenny's eyes follow a glamorous couple. As David continues to watch her, she briefly meets his gaze, offering a self-conscious smile. Fully engrossed in each other, Helen and Danny seem oblivious to their surroundings. Laughter erupts between Jenny and David as they share a smile.\n\nReturning home, Jenny cautiously opens the front door and treads softly inside. Her mother, busy in the kitchen, acknowledges her with a vague nod before turning back to her casserole. Margarie casts a quick look over her shoulder. With a heavy heart, Jenny exits the kitchen.\n\nOutside the school, David waits by his car. Jenny rushes out, now changed from her school uniform, and they both grin. She climbs into the passenger seat as David takes the driver's position. They set off in the Bristol towards an auction. Danny gives a knowing smile as a woman nearby shakes her head. Jenny reaches out excitedly again, her enthusiasm mirrored by David's grin.\n\nDanny's residence is nothing short of palatial, adorned with art and luxurious furnishings. Helen turns to gaze intently at Jenny, and they seal an agreement with a handshake. Later, inside David's car parked in an area lined with tall townhouses, David removes his hat. He approaches a family laden with luggage on a street corner. Jenny, admiring his effortless charm, watches as he playfully swings a young boy under one arm while assisting with the bags. David ushers the family through a wooden front door. An older woman peeks out from behind some curtains, and Jenny looks up at her. Inside the car, Jenny leans forward, retrieves a packet of cigarettes from the glove box, lights one, and observes David as he returns to the vehicle.\n\nSlumping onto her desk, Jenny later finds herself at home, staring at her mother in disbelief. She joins friends at a café, where Graham arrives on his bicycle, attempting to brush off a scuffle with a forced laugh. From her bedroom, Jenny steps onto the landing and listens to the conversation of her parents downstairs, her expression wistful. Suppressing a giggle, she feels a mix of emotions. Helen places a scarf in Jenny's hair, and wearing Helen's vibrant little dress, Jenny smiles nervously. She later sports a stylish coat and has her hair neatly styled. Danny and David stand, admiring her transformation. They drive through the countryside in David's Bristol as the sun illuminates the majestic stone buildings of Oxford. Jenny's gaze is drawn to the spires, while Helen shudders. Later, in a pub, Jenny closes her book with a grin. Preparing for bed, she exits the bathroom to find David lying fully clothed on the bed.",
    "1066": "The landscape transforms as birds soar over now verdant land where once dusty plains stretched. These have given way to rivers, lakes, and islands, with waterfalls cascading down the rocks of what used to be a dry canyon. Amidst this rejuvenation, Sarah and Drover find solace in a pool, embracing each other. The tranquility is momentarily disrupted as Nullah leaps into the water, joining them. As evening twilight sets in, the trio enjoys a cheerful outdoor meal.\n\nLater, Sarah and Drover share a passionate kiss while wrapped in each other's arms. However, moments of joy are fleeting as Sarah watches Drover ride away. The sound of thundering hooves signals his return, driving a herd of horses past their home. Drover races to the porch where Sarah awaits and throws himself into her embrace, sealing their reunion with an intense kiss.\n\nTension rises when Fletcher forcefully knocks Carney into a swamp, and a crocodile attacks the cattle king. As the sun sets, Drover, still mounted on his horse, leans down to share a tender kiss with Sarah.\n\nFaraway Downs, with its house and vibrant gardens, glows under the sun's rays. Inside, a man wearing crocodile boots ties cotton around a fly. Fletcher, in a display of arrogance, props his boot on the dining table, drawing a dismayed stare from Sarah. He approaches her, whispering secrets that unsettle her further, and gestures toward a display of spears before leaving her frowning in his wake. Bandy reenters the room slowly, to whom Sarah turns with anxiety.\n\nFrom atop a water tower, Nullah surveys the landscape, his arrival witnessed by Sarah from the verandah. After checking his herd, Nullah gallops away. Meanwhile, Sarah awakens in bed, her expression shifting from a frown to a smile as she caresses Drover’s bearded cheek and hairy, muscular chest.\n\nElsewhere, a wild horse bucks fiercely in a training ring under Drover's watchful eye, who frowns at the young Nullah hiding behind a gate. As Drover trims his beard, Sarah soaks in the bath, her mood somber as she listens sullenly and exchanges a silent, tense moment with Drover on the verandah.\n\nBirds fly over a rocky hill as Drover skillfully works a brumby in the paddock, twirling a lariat and successfully roping the horse, which bucks wildly in an attempt to escape. Nearby, Bandy heats a brand in the fire and quickly hands it to Sarah, who then brands a steer that is held down. In the midst of her tasks, Nullah, while watching over the horses, notices his grandfather and communicates with him through hand gestures.\n\nIn the paddock, Drover continues to work the wild brumby, pulling firmly on the rope to control its bucking. Nullah, caught between two worlds, looks from Sarah to his grandfather. As the brumby trots calmly toward Drover, who extends his hand, Sarah holds Nullah close, her gaze scanning the empty plain behind them.",
    "1068": "As Drover, Magarri, and Goolaj gallop swiftly across the open plain, Japanese fighters soar menacingly over Mission Island. One fighter jet breaks formation, diving aggressively towards the island. Meanwhile, in his cell, King George, squatting and contemplative, lifts his head to gaze upward. On the island's beach, young Nullah turns his eyes skyward, watching in awe as four planes split from the main group and swoop dangerously close to him.\n\nSarah, concerned, enters the army operations room and exchanges a worried glance with Cath. Nullah's attention remains fixated on the menacing planes above. King George rises to his feet in his cell as the aircraft dive towards the children playing on the beach. Fear grips Nullah as his eyes widen; he bolts across the sand as bombs begin to rain down on the Mission.\n\nA priest rushes towards the radio hut, but a plane zeroes in on it, and a bomb destroys the shack. From his cell, King George witnesses the explosion through the barred window. Concurrently, Fletcher signs the contract to purchase Faraway Downs and steps out onto the balcony of his high-rise office, overlooking the unfolding chaos. Dutton, hearing the distant rumble of explosions, pauses in his tracks. Fighters soon appear in the sky over Darwin, and Fletcher, now on his balcony, observes the ominous black specks approaching in the sky. The planes disperse from their formation, initiating their attack.\n\nInside the operations room, Sarah stands and removes her headset, her gaze fixed outside the window just as a bomb detonates nearby, enveloping her in a whirlwind of smoke, fire, and shattered glass. The planes, marked by the red rising sun on their wings, unleash chaos upon the town, with soldiers scrambling to organize a defense.\n\nA bomb explodes near the prison, and flames surge into King George's cell. Captain Dutton, amidst the pandemonium, shouts orders, leading to the release of the prisoners. As soldiers clamber into a truck, King George exits the prison, walking slowly through the smoke-filled, burning gates as the town's defense remains disorganized.\n\nA ship suffers a direct hit, erupting in flames and black smoke. As bombs continue to fall, creating towering pillars of fire, King George stands amidst the chaos, impassively observing the destruction. The relentless bombing campaign continues, devastating the town.\n\nAmidst the smoke and flames, Drover and Magarri sit atop their horses, stunned by the carnage unfolding before them. As night falls, fires blaze across the darkened town, cloaked in a thick veil of smoke. They ride towards the collapsing, burning buildings in search of Sarah. The Carney house is engulfed in flames, with firefighters struggling futilely against the inferno. Drover's eyes widen in horror as a group of men prevent him from entering the blaze. Captain Dutton, shocked, gazes at a stretcher his men have brought in, bearing witness to the toll of the attack.",
    "1064": "At dawn, the sky glows orange, casting silhouettes of two figures and a tree against the horizon. The boy's grandfather reaches for his fishing pole. Suddenly, the boy finds himself submerged, lying wide-eyed at the bottom of the water as a White man in a suit collapses face-first into the depths above him. The man's lifeless body floats over the boy, his blood seeping into the water before sinking to the bottom. Breaking the surface, the boy spots a horse struggling in the water. He reaches out and the horse swims towards him. He gently strokes its muzzle before climbing onto its back, urging the animal forward and out of the water. With only shorts on and his long hair trailing behind, he rides through a dusty landscape dotted with sparse trees and towering rocky formations.\n\nHe continues his journey through a settlement named Faraway Downs, characterized by wooden structures and animal pens. Smoke from a bonfire mingles with the dust in the air, and an animal skull dangles from a dry branch. Spotting an overloaded truck approaching through the dusty haze, he dismounts with a worried expression and sprints through the settlement. Seeking refuge, he hides inside a water tank as another man attempts to seize the horse. Peeking through a crack in the tank, he observes an elegant woman in a bonnet and long coat purposefully striding towards a house. Soon after, this woman rides a horse to a large country house where a car pulls up, and a man in a bowler hat emerges. Her blue eyes glittering with discontent, she crumples a telegram in her hand and later gazes out of an airplane window at a ship moored at a port.\n\nElsewhere, in a bar, a red-bearded speaker is knocked down, causing the rough-looking crew around to grow nervous. Drover, after downing a drink, up-ends his glass. An Aboriginal man approaches, and the pipe-smoking barman glares at him before coolly sealing the doors. Inside, Drover engages with Bull, the red-bearded man, while outside, Sarah efficiently organizes her porters before briskly moving on. As Drover gets thrown over the bar but quickly retaliates, a full-blown brawl ensues just as Sarah approaches the pub. Entering the pub, Sarah observes the barman wielding a raised truncheon and an old drunk slumped in a corner, while the barman rolls his eyes in exasperation. She makes her way towards the door, exiting just as Drover sends Bull crashing into her luggage. The ensuing melee sees them using suitcases as weapons, one of which bursts open, sending underwear flying through the air.\n\nCarney observes the chaotic scene with binoculars. Horrified, Sarah navigates through the brawling crowd, curious onlookers, and flying garments. Drover breaks a case over his opponent's head, knocking Bull down. Exhausted, Drover faces Sarah, who looks appalled at the scene. His black friend, standing behind him, gestures to indicate Sarah's presence.",
    "1072": "In the vast Australian outback, a man tenderly picks up a silky item, holding it out with an apologetic smile. He then hands water to the men lounging contentedly atop a truck as it travels across the sandy desert. Clutching his dog, he gazes at Sarah, who is peering out of the passenger window. A disturbing sight unfolds as a kangaroo paw and a trickle of blood slide down the windscreen, causing Sarah to peer in horror through her desert glasses, her net veil fluttering in the breeze.\n\nThe group's journey continues as they drive over a weir, crossing a broad river, before setting up camp around a fire at night. In the camp, Drover washes his muscular torso with water from a bucket, catching Sarah's eye as she pops her head out of her tent, mesmerized by the water cascading off his rippling muscles. They share a playful moment, miming keeping each other warm before Sarah ducks back into her tent. Drover approaches her with a raised eyebrow and suggestively pulls down his trousers' waistband.\n\nElsewhere, camels are seen pulling a truck without an engine, observed by Goolaj and Magarri. Suddenly, a man falls off the vehicle and lies in a dusty heap. Later, he finds himself next to a horrified Sarah in the truck. Drover nods as they continue across a dusty plain, slowly navigating a rocky track.\n\nA girl runs up to them, and a boy gallops through sparse trees on a horse, arriving at Faraway Downs where he reins in the horse, watching the approaching truck. The boy dashes through the gate to the house and leaps over a fence, narrowly missing the rearing horse. Thick smoke begins to obscure the house as the boy climbs into a water tower. Amidst the smoke, Drover walks forward, the boy dropping down inside the tower.\n\nInside the truck, Sarah sits uncomfortably beside the inebriated Kipling. As the smoke dissipates, it reveals a large house. Kipling collapses as Drover, enveloped in smoke, passes a dead cow. Sarah, her jaw set, exits the truck and storms furiously towards the house while Drover approaches a blazing funeral fire, examining it thoughtfully before scanning his surroundings.\n\nThe boy stretches out his hands, and an Aboriginal man sits on the ground nearby. As Sarah enters the house, women offer her buckets of smoking leaves. The boy poses mystically as Sarah strides past household members and is confronted by the sight of her husband, dead on a table. Overwhelmed, she reels in shock upon seeing the wound in the middle of his chest, his eyes staring glassily. She reaches out to close Maitland's eyes, but another man's hand does so first. Sarah eyes this man, her hand still poised near Maitland's face, as staff members hover in the corners of the room. Outside, the house is engulfed in a cloud of dust and smoke, a significant blaze yet tiny against the vast landscape.",
    "1073": "From his hiding spot in the long grass, the boy observes the world around him. As he emerges, his smile, as parched as the endless plains stretching towards the distant hills, spreads across his face. He joins Sarah, walking down the hill away from the cemetery. The sun dips below the horizon, casting a warm glow over the darkening plains and hills. Night falls, enveloping the house and buildings of Faraway Downs in darkness. The lights within the house flicker off, plunging it into silence. Moonlight streams through the curtains, bathing Sarah as she sleeps peacefully in bed.\n\nFletcher, standing by the window, peers into the night and gently coaxes an aboriginal lady back inside. Meanwhile, the rhythmic chanting of King George by a fire pierces the quiet. Startled, Sarah bolts upright in bed and lights a lamp, her heart racing. Beneath the steps she stands on, something stirs, and King George continues his dance by the hilltop fire. Hastening indoors, Sarah finds the boy in her bedroom. He strikes a dramatic pose as the curtains billow around him, his broad grin captivating her. Intrigued, Sarah's curiosity is piqued. A shadow momentarily darkens the porch, prompting Fletcher to peer through the shutters, only to see nothing and depart.\n\nSarah rises from her bed, scanning the room. With Nullah by her side, she approaches the window, looking out cautiously. Startled by a sudden noise, she spins around to see the curtains billowing. As morning breaks, clothes flutter on a line under the bright sun. Fletcher steps out of his cabin, followed by Nullah's mother lingering in the doorway. He surveys the homestead, scratching his head in confusion as she trails behind him. Dressed in an orange dress, she glances at Fletcher, then strides away from him and the cabin. Absently, Fletcher tosses a stone, watching her disappear into the distance. The sun climbs into the clear blue sky, heralding a new day.\n\nSarah steps onto the veranda of the main house, with Nullah in tow. As two riders approach, Nullah scampers off, hiding behind the gate which he then opens. Walking slowly towards them, Nullah greets them, while Sarah offers a nervous smile and a nod. Nullah, pulling away from the Chinese cook, climbs up to remove a chain securing the blades of the windmill. The windmill, now freed, swings around and begins to turn, drawing rusty water from a pipe as everyone watches in awe. The moment is broken as Fletcher gives chase to the boy, who leaps over a fence just out of his reach. Fletcher, grabbing the boy, holds his mother aside and strikes him again, only to be confronted by Sarah striding forward. With a swift motion, she strikes Fletcher across the face with a riding crop, her finger pointing at him with unwavering determination.\n\nFletcher, reaching his truck, looks around before backing away as Flynn joins Sarah at her side. He drives off into the dusty horizon, followed by his Drovers who abandon the cattle to ride after him. Sing Song, standing by, watches the scene unfold without expression. Nullah, his mother, and her friend, comforting each other, also join Sarah. She exchanges a glance with Flynn, who respectfully tips his hat to her. Surrounded by her newfound companions, Sarah shields her eyes from the sun, reflecting on the journey ahead. Back inside, she sits at her messy desk, contemplating the events that have unfolded.",
    "1077": "Nullah sprints towards Flynn, who tragically gets trampled by a frenzied herd of animals. As Nullah winces at the horrific scene, he finds himself alone on the cliff's edge, bravely facing the oncoming stampede. In a tense, slow-motion sequence, the herd draws ever nearer. Meanwhile, Drover and Sarah spur their horses forward, racing against time. Fletcher watches with a cruel grin on his face.\n\nConcentrating intensely, Nullah stretches his arms out towards the stampede, his grandfather chanting beside him. Positioned precariously at the cliff's edge, Nullah's efforts cause the herd to slow dramatically, halting just yards from where he stands. King George observes the scene from above. As Sarah and Drover finally arrive, Nullah, overwhelmed, begins to cry. Sarah quickly dismounts and catches him just as he teeters on the brink of the abyss. Drover then grabs them both, pulling them back to safety. Nullah looks up at Sarah with a mix of relief and gratitude, then turns to nestle into her shoulder. Drover, feeling out of place, steps back awkwardly. King George, watching from a distance, smiles with pride.\n\nDrover rides over to where Flynn lies, his body twisted and bloodied in the dust. He leans in close to hear Flynn's final, faint words. Flynn's eyes flutter and then close for the last time, leaving Drover to frown down at him solemnly. Drover retrieves his hat from beside the deceased, placing it on his head, and picks up Flynn's harmonica, examining it thoughtfully.\n\nLater, Nullah holds the harmonica as Sarah sits amidst the charred remains of their camp. He offers her one of her hats, but she, feeling embarrassed, lets it fall to the ground. Grief washes over her face as she stands and watches Nullah. Drover joins her, and they exchange determined looks.\n\nUnder a clear blue sky dotted with high white clouds, the drive continues in the blazing sun. Sarah, now riding with confidence, expertly wields the whip. Nullah skillfully rounds up a stray steer, and they all head towards the golden glow of the sunset.\n\nBack at the cliff, Fletcher steps onto Flynn's makeshift grave, his crocodile-skinned boot resting on the pile of rocks. He picks up a stone, toying with it as he gazes thoughtfully into the abyss while his men approach. A gust of wind blows Flynn's hat off the grave's cross, and Fletcher watches the distant herd, now visible as a mere cloud of dust.\n\nDrover's team sets up camp by a river, where everyone, except Drover, drinks Poor Fella Rum from tin cups. Drover drinks directly from the bottle. The strong liquor doesn't deter Sing Song and Sarah, who hold out their cups for more. An empty bottle falls to the ground, startling a wallaby that sniffs at it curiously.\n\nSarah rises and walks over to Drover, who leans against a tree. Their laughter fades as they look deeply into each other's eyes. Gradually, their faces move closer together. Sarah, her bright blue eyes closing, shares a tender kiss with Drover.",
    "1078": "In the unfolding drama, Nullah descends from a tree as Sarah and another stand beside each other, their guilt palpable. Sarah watches, curiosity etched on her face, as he moves away thoughtfully. Her expression shifts to shock while he gazes at her steadily. As he approaches, she lifts her eyes to meet his, a smile playing on her lips before she shyly looks down. He offers a strained smile and departs, leaving her to hesitate before wandering through the long grass.\n\nIn the harsh light of day, a dead steer lies beside a watering hole where Magarri examines the water. Drover, Sarah, and Nullah approach on horseback. Magarri's face is contemplative. They find themselves in a great sandy desert, their spirits low as Nullah joins them at the watering hole. Sarah's eyes fix on a lone figure crossing the dusty expanse. King George stands, balanced on one leg against his spear, his gaze piercing through the swirling dust towards them. As they near him, he erupts into song and dance, his spears twirling against the backdrop of the fiery sunset. Amid a dust storm, cattle move restlessly, almost swallowed by the swirling dirt, while King George's song continues.\n\nIn his dreams, Nullah envisions his grandfather discovering water and catching a fish. In the twilight of the desert, King George triumphantly holds up a fish on a pole, chanting, his body covered in dust, his long hair and beard caked with the desert's grit.\n\nIn another scene, Carney hands a pen to the captain. Fletcher, in the cattle pen, ends a phone call as the captain hesitates over a purchase agreement. Women in a salon marvel at a calf wandering past their window. The building trembles as the captain finalizes the agreement. Sweating under Darwin's oppressive heat, he looks up to see the drove thundering into town. Carney's frown deepens as the salon women gape in awe at the cattle filling the streets. Carney watches through the slats of his sun-blinds as Sarah arrives on horseback. His glare is directed at another as they swiftly turn their horses and gallop away. Carney lunges for the phone.\n\nFletcher, in angry disbelief, watches as Drover leaps his horse into the holding yard. Drover rides through the yard, whip cracking, while Fletcher scrambles to rally his team. The gates of the pen are shut before Drover, but the gate to the wooden loading tunnel is raised, allowing cattle to surge in as Sarah leads her herd toward the docks. Amid the rumbling of Sarah's herd, the Carney men, laughing, direct their cattle into the loading tunnel extending down the wharf. Drover, after a brief moment of thought, rides off, jumping the fence of the yard, dislodging a top slat, and entering the street outside the Territory Hotel. Fletcher's glare follows him as Drover eyes the Carney herd being loaded onto a large cargo vessel at the wharf's end.",
    "1079": "A wooden loading tunnel stretches directly to the cattle enclosure. As Fletcher watches intently, police officers step out from their office. Meanwhile, Administrator Allsop gazes through his telescope at the unfolding scene. Suddenly, Drover gallops through Carney's men, slicing the rope that holds the gate at the tunnel's end aloft. The gate falls shut, confining the cattle within. As Sarah's cattle stampede down the wharf, Drover snaps his whip. The townsfolk erupt in cheers as Sarah rides by the hotel. The cattle surge onto a ship as Nullah approaches Sarah. She nods and flashes a triumphant smile while Nullah trails behind the last of the herd. Sarah locks eyes with Fletcher, and they exchange glares before she advances toward him. Fletcher appears nervous, blinking as Sarah menacingly cracks her whip near his face. With a grin, she rides away, keeping her eyes fixed on him. Nullah rushes the final steer aboard the ship. Amidst the jubilant crowd, Drover escorts Sarah to the pub, where she beams with pride as two glasses are set on the bar and filled with Poor Fella Rum. They gulp down the strong drink, gasping at its potency, then share a laugh, gazing into each other's eyes. Back at the holding yard, Fletcher picks up the phone. From the veranda of his house, Carney glares down at him. Fletcher remains standing, his shoulders slumped beside the phone. Overcome with joy, Sarah embraces Drover tightly, tears glistening in her eyes. In a small yard, Drover works with Capricornia, coaxing the mare to lie down. From the balcony above, Sarah observes, marveling at Drover's gentle interaction with the horse. She descends the stairs to join him. Startled, Drover turns around, only to frown and look away, breaking eye contact before nodding thoughtfully. He then locks eyes with Sarah once more before walking away, leaving her feeling uneasy and disappointed. Meanwhile, Nullah sits despondently by a cooking fire with Sing Song and Bandy Legs. She dips her fingers into the ashes, smears black ash on Nullah's cheek, and offers a smile. A man observes them from a distance, his large eyes fixed on her. Later, in the segregated section of the audience downstairs, Sing Song sits with Bandy, who turns to look up at the black Nullah seated in the rafters near the projector, watching with wide-eyed fascination. The atmosphere shifts as everyone turns to stare at Carney, who drinks from a wine bottle. He strides toward Sarah, who promptly places his bottle on a waiter's tray. Extending his hand, Carney is met with a wary glance from Sarah. Her frown deepens as King, grinning widely, leads her to the dance floor. From his position by the punchbowl, Fletcher watches. A photographer captures their moment on the dance floor. Sarah then sits alone, lost in thought. Allsop pauses, his gaze fixed. Everyone in the garden turns their attention to the house. Sarah, gasping, turns around and stands, staring in awe. At the top of the steps leading to the garden stands the Drover, now clean-shaven and clad in a white tuxedo.",
    "1083": "In a cabin filled with the sick, Tuvia ponders deeply as Lilka enters. His gaze intently searches her expression before she returns a revolver to him. Meanwhile, at the army camp, Viktor studies a chart just as Tuvia arrives. Zus, upon seeing Tuvia, turns away dismissively before approaching. Later, under the cover of night in the abandoned town of Stakiewicze, Tuvia and Zus sit inside a parked vehicle. Tuvia, battling a cough, reveals an ornate Mezuzah case which Zus quickly snatches away before exiting the truck. He then signals to Benzion and Krensky, and the trio stealthily move across to a building, heading towards the police station marked by the Nazi flag.\n\nFrom within the vehicle, Tuvia's feverish eyes anxiously watch as gunshots and flashing lights erupt outside. He grips his gun tightly, startled by the sudden chaos. Inside the police station, Krensky is fatally shot, prompting Benzion to retaliate, killing two policemen in the process. Trembling, Tuvia watches from afar as Zus dashes into another office, narrowly escaping gunfire from the police chief whom he quickly shoots down. In a swift move, Zus opens a cupboard, grabs small medicine bottles, and stuffs them into a sack.\n\nBenzion leaps over the police counter, grabs a transmitter, and destroys it with the butt of his rifle. A policeman suddenly enters, shooting Benzion dead. Zus, wounded, returns to the front office and eliminates the policeman. With a face shadowed by dread, Tuvia observes from the vehicle as it speeds away from the town. In pain, Zus manages to present the collected medicine bottles. The truck's headlights slice through the serene countryside as they escape.\n\nLater, Shimon conducts a solemn burial. Back in his cabin, Tuvia struggles against his fever. During mealtime, as groups huddle together, Arkady stands at the food table, glaring at Asael. Both men draw their knives, but upon seeing Tuvia's drawn and pale face with dark circles under his eyes, Arkady sheathes his weapon and walks away with a sneer. Asael, filled with anger, watches Tuvia retreat, while Lilka looks on, visibly anxious.\n\nAt the army camp, Zus sits alone. Lova, part of his group, kneels by a basin of water, his face and hands smeared with blood. Zus's eyes flash with anger. In Viktor's tent, a bleary-eyed Viktor plays the accordion while Gramov whistles beside him. Viktor pours himself another glass of vodka, and when Zus points out Gramov's inattention, Viktor strikes him across the face. Gramov looks up at his commanding officer and then at Zus, as Viktor dismisses the incident with a casual wave. Zus exits the tent, leaving the scene behind.",
    "1084": "As the narrative unfolds, Viktor and Gramov lead their group on horseback, while Zus and the remaining soldiers follow on foot. Back in camp, Tuvia battles a fever within the confines of his cabin. Outside, a queue forms as people patiently wait for their food. Amidst this, Arkady and his friend share a light moment, laughing over a joke.\n\nSuddenly, Aron dashes to his brother's cabin. In the midst of the camp's routine, Chaya serves generous plates of food to Arkady's table. Tuvia emerges, his attention immediately drawn to Asael's black eye. Asael, catching his gaze, looks toward Arkady, who stands with his back turned, indulging in his meal.\n\nArkady feigns ignorance, taking another spoonful of food, before handing his plate to a nearby cohort. With a scowl of defiance, he turns to face Tuvia. Glancing around, Arkady notes the fearful expressions among the onlookers. Tuvia, struck with disbelief, watches as Asael lowers his head in shame.\n\nFacing the community, with Arkady smirking behind him, Tuvia swiftly turns and fatally shoots Arkady at point-blank range. He then points his gun at Arkady's cohort before lowering it. Asael, visibly nervous, swallows hard. The men at the table leap up, hastily bending down to carry away Arkady's lifeless body, passing by Lilka, Chaya, and Rachel.\n\nTuvia, flanked by his younger brothers, stands defiantly before the silent gathering. Later, he lies in bed, a blanket drawn up to his chin. His eyes flicker open to see Lilka gazing down at him. Her soft smile briefly illuminates his face before his eyes close again. Lilka takes a seat near his bed, watching over him as a ray of sunshine casts a golden glow over the log cabin.\n\nArmed and alert, Tuvia takes an early morning watch. In his cabin, Asael unhooks a curtain to peer outside, noting the thawing icicles. Lilka, basking in the sun's warmth, raises her face to the sky. Tuvia treads through the softening snow, wandering off into the hazy sunlight.\n\nThe entire Bielski camp gathers for a group photograph, a camera set on a tripod capturing the moment. Nearby, some women wash in the creek, with Bella playfully splashing Chaya. Tamara, wrapped in a black coat despite the sunshine, looks nervous and frightened. Lilka steps out of the water to approach her, and Tamara, after a cautious glance around, takes Lilka's hand, leading her away from the others. Opening her coat, Tamara reveals her pregnancy to Lilka, whose clear blue eyes search Tamara's face as it crumples with emotion. Lilka offers comfort, gently squeezing Tamara's clasped hands.\n\nThe scene shifts as Tuvia emerges from the trees, his gun held loosely in his hand, marking another moment in their ongoing journey.",
    "1088": "The Bielski lines are bombarded by more exploding cannonballs, causing further casualties among their ranks. Asael, unable to see through the thick smoke, fires his gun blindly in an attempt to retaliate. Regaining his strength, Tuvia throws a bag to Malvin and swiftly dashes across the field. Both Tuvia and Malvin plunge into the dense forest, advancing behind enemy lines with a clear view of the German soldiers and their tank up ahead. They lower themselves to the ground as a group of six Germans pass by and establish a gun position right in front of them. With a determined look of vengeance, Tuvia readies his machine gun, steps forward, and ruthlessly eliminates each German soldier.\n\nTuvia seizes the German gun and positions himself in the undergrowth behind their lines. He opens fire on the unsuspecting troops, successfully taking out several. The Germans, in response, reorganize their efforts. The heavy gun of the tank begins to swivel menacingly towards Tuvia and Malbin. As the ominous barrel of the gun nears, Tuvia quickly evades, diving behind a tree for cover. The tank fires into the brush behind him, while more Germans rapidly advance across the field, taking positions dangerously close to their hideout. Explosive shells erupt on either side of Tuvia, narrowly missing him. Malbin, seeking refuge, cowers behind a nearby tree. The tank unleashes another shot, showering them with gunpowder and debris.\n\nMalbin, with his jaw set in determination, readies an explosive. He charges from behind the tree toward the tank but is fatally shot during his brave assault. The explosive detonates near him. Amidst the chaos, the helmeted Germans shoot towards Tuvia's position. Shells ricochet off the surrounding trees. A German soldier cautiously approaches but is shot in the back. His comrades briefly turn, startled by gunfire erupting from behind a dense line of trees. Suddenly, Zus emerges from the forest, catching the Germans by surprise and efficiently eliminating them.\n\nZus's men follow him out of the woods, joining the fray against the remaining German forces. As the tank fires again, Zus climbs onto it and pulls out his pistol. The tank operator slumps lifelessly to the side. Zus drops a grenade into the tank, causing a devastating explosion. His troops spread out across the field, marching in formation and firing on the last of the Germans, leaving none alive. Standing atop the tank, Zus scans the trees with anxious eyes. His men methodically search the pockets of the fallen soldiers. Tuvia emerges from the dissipating smoke, his intense blue eyes scanning the surroundings alertly.\n\nThe Bielski Otriad, positioned on the hillside with their weapons ready, lift their heads. Gradually, they rise to their feet and begin the ascent to the top of the sunlit slope.",
    "1080": "In the backdrop of a rally, the voice of Adolph Hitler resonates as grainy black and white footage captures him. He extends his arm at a slight angle, giving the Nazi salute while reviewing troops. A Nazi motorcade then rolls toward a curved metal bridge, where a skull and crossbones on a black flag flutters ominously in the breeze.\n\nAmidst this chilling scene, a man is dragged across the street, others bearing identifying labels on their backs, hounded by Nazi officers. Jews are mercilessly shot into a ditch, and women, cowering in fear, are forcibly removed from their homes. One woman collapses and is roughly pulled to her feet. Old men, wearing cloth caps and carrying bags, along with women clutching cases, are herded away from their village.\n\nThe brutality escalates as black-uniformed SS officers kick a man lying on the ground, and a helmeted German soldier callously shoots another in the back. An officer, displaying chilling calm, retrieves a revolver from his inside pocket, raises it, and fires at a young man who falls lifelessly. The officer then casually pockets his gun and resumes his conversation, indifferent to the horror he inflicted. An army photographer documents this grim event.\n\nSmall children are forcibly loaded into trucks, families are torn apart. A bony-cheeked SS officer, puffing on a cigarette, watches a truck filled with people trundle past, escorted by Nazi outriders. This scene is observed by two men hiding behind a tree, one in his 30s, the other in his early 20s. Nearby, they witness men from the village being led into a wood by black-shirts and their dogs. Overwhelmed, the two watchers flee the scene.\n\nAs they escape, they pass a body lying face-down in a marshy pond and vault over a farm gate, near which another man lies slumped against the fence. The younger man, Asael, drops his head, breathing heavily, and looks helplessly up at his older brother, Zus.\n\nZus, tall and dark-haired with an unshaven look, carrying a small axe, stealthily moves across the farmhouse. He opens a low door, steps inside, and crouches down to pull back two planks from the floor. A small boy with a blackened face and hands peers up at his two older brothers. Warily, the boy, Aron, takes Zus' hand and steps out of the hole. Zus tenderly pats the boy's blackened face. Moments later, Asael places a cloth bag over Aron's shoulder.\n\nZus, noticing something in the farmhouse doorway, sets down his saw. He carefully removes a narrow ornamental case engraved with Hebrew writing, a mezuzah, from the door frame. Quickly grabbing the saw and the cloth bag, he hurries his little brother away, past a flock of ducks. Zus steadies Aron, holding him to his feet and leaning him against a tree. In a moment of closeness, Zus pats Asael's neck and rests his head against his brother's brow, sharing a silent moment of solidarity amidst their dire circumstances.",
    "1090": "Tuvia's gaze, hardened yet flickering with recognition, meets Aron and the group he has led to safety. Some among them eagerly bite into chunks of hard bread, their hunger palpable. Nearby, Zus stands with a look of unease etched across his face. He gestures to Tuvia, urging his older brother to step away for a private conversation. Tuvia departs, leaving Zus with a lingering expression of doubt.\n\nIn the dimly lit atmosphere of a cottage, Tuvia pours two vodkas. A dark-haired Russian joins him at the table, placing a gun down which Tuvia promptly takes. As he pockets the bullets and tucks the gun into his belt, he catches a glimpse of the wife's hostile expression while she chops meat. The men clink their glasses, pour some vodka away, and drink the rest. Tuvia takes a bite of bread, the wife ignoring him, yet he cracks a smile as a beam of light pierces through the window. Suddenly, Tuvia dashes out the back door. The wife swiftly clears the glasses from the table.\n\nTuvia ascends into Koscik's barn, joining half a dozen others already in hiding. An official car pulls up, its headlights slicing through the night. Koscik, holding a vodka bottle, stands outside his cottage and hands over the bottle to Bernicki, who takes a gulp and passes it to a colleague. Inside the barn, a cough breaks the silence, prompting Tuvia to draw the gun he had taken earlier. He takes another gulp of vodka as tension mounts. In a tense moment, Bielski's eyes bulge and he mimics pointing a pistol at Koscik's head before patting him on the cheek and leaving. Bernicki and his two young associates return to their car. Relief washes over Tuvia in the barn.\n\nOutside, Koscik distributes clothing to the Jews who had been hiding, watched uneasily by Tuvia. Koscik then hands him a bottle and a loaf of rye bread, their eyes meeting with a moment of compassion before Koscik nods. They shake hands, and Tuvia strides past the small group of uncertain Jews, glancing back over his shoulder as they hasten to follow him into the forest.\n\nEarly the next morning, one of the Jews approaches Tuvia from behind. A man, dressed smartly in a hat and coat, leans against a tree to catch his breath. Later, the expanded group gathers for a meal. A girl bites into a piece of fruit and shares it with her neighbor. A woman wearing a beret scoops soup with a ladle and passes the pot to Shimon the schoolteacher, who in turn serves Aron sitting next to Asael. Meanwhile, Zus chops at a tree. Tuvia, observing from nearby, notices an old man carrying his daughter. Zus secures some rope and departs. Tuvia then walks up a leafy slope toward the old man, who is busy filling a grave with earth.",
    "1098": "In Walt's home, Sue makes her way to the basement's mesh door. He dashes out the back door with Sue in pursuit. Under the cover of night, Walt approaches Smokie's house and gazes up at it, his face partially cloaked in shadow. A gangster at the window notices Walt, prompting Smokie and Spider to emerge and confront him. As more gangsters materialize, Spider brandishes a gun, drawing the attention of the neighbors.\n\nWalt, in a defiant gesture, points his finger like a gun at the gangsters, mimicking shooting them. He then displays a cigarette, places it between his lips, and slowly reaches into his jacket. Suddenly, he pulls his hand out, prompting the gangsters to unleash a barrage of gunfire. Bullets tear through Walt's body, and he falls backward onto the ground. As he collapses, his hand opens, revealing his 1st Cavalry lighter. Blood seeps from his sleeve into his palm and drips from his mouth, while the unlit cigarette rests beside his body, arranged in a cruciform.\n\nAs Walt's life ends, police car lights flash in the darkness. Walt's Gran Torino arrives at Smokie's house, from which Thao and Sue emerge and rush to a police officer. They, along with Father Janovich, watch solemnly as a body bag is loaded into an ambulance. Nearby, police have handcuffed gangsters kneeling on a patch of grass, observed by Father J. Thao clenches his lip as a police captain stands over the gangsters. Sue and Thao witness Spider being led in handcuffs to a squad car, followed by Smokie, whose bruised face from Walt's earlier attack glares defiantly at them as he is pushed into a cruiser. Thao's breathing becomes labored as emotions surge within him, still wearing Walt's Silver Star pinned to his T-shirt.\n\nLater, Thao, Sue, and their mother, adorned in traditional Hmong attire with Sue also wearing a turban-like headdress, depart their home and enter a taxi. Grandma remains on the porch, watching them leave, her gaze shifting to Daisy, who sits forlornly at the top of the steps.\n\nAt the church, a crowd has gathered for Walt's funeral. Lying in an open casket before the altar in his new suit, Walt is mourned by many, including Mitch and Karen, who sit in the front pew next to Steve. Mitch casts a glare across the aisle at Thao as Father Janovich steps forward to conduct the service.\n\nThe family then gathers for the reading of Walt's will, where Mitch and Steve exchange a glance and Ashley smiles in anticipation.",
    "1099": "In the opening scene, Walt crushes a cigarette underfoot, his gaze fixed incredulously on Ashley after he had just draped a cover over his car. He then strides toward the door, spits in disgust, and exits, leaving Ashley to roll her eyes in response.\n\nWalt opens his front door to find Thao, a teenager, standing on his porch. Quickly, he slams the door shut and turns away to face Father Janovich, the young priest whom he brusquely pushes past.\n\nNext door, a procession of Southeast Asian Hmong people approach the front door, many carrying dishes filled with food. As the mourners depart, Walt assists a woman by using jump leads to start her car. Moments later, Mitch arrives in a Toyota Land Cruiser, drawing Walt's attention as the silver vehicle drives away. Walt places his jump leads on a garden table and ascends the back porch, looking over at his neighbors and their friends congregated in the garden. He snarls as he observes an elder in ceremonial attire readying to slaughter a chicken.\n\nNearby, a grandmother converses with a middle-aged man, while the extended family assembles before the elder, Kor Khue, who shakes a hoop adorned with metal rings. Beside him, a young woman cradles a baby wrapped in a vibrantly embroidered papoose. Kor Khue then places the hoop on the carpet and tosses a split horn into it. Thao emerges from the back door, and Kor Khue gestures to the mother and child with cupped hands as the father beside them raises his hands in a reverent gesture.\n\nWalt is seen sweeping his driveway with a broom, and his Labrador, Daisy, bounds down the front steps. He watches the adjacent garden as Thao ascends his own front steps, noting the thin, parched grass. From her porch, Grandma observes Walt, muttering to herself. Walt, glaring back, spits, only to be met with a copious spit from Grandma, causing Walt to grimace. Inside his home, he leans down to Daisy by the front door, later opening it to Father Janovich before promptly shutting it again.\n\nThao is seen strolling alongside a high chain link fence, engrossed in a book, when a large black sedan with side exhaust pipes pulls up, two robust Latino men leaning out the window. Thao continues his walk, managing a smile as a white car carrying five South Asian men, led by Spider with his long black hair and bandanna, stops ahead. Spider spots Thao, drives down the road, and pulls up beside the black sedan. Both Spider and Smokie, another occupant of the white car, lean out their window, facing the Latino men—one wielding a revolver, the other a machine pistol. The Latino men speed away, and Spider reverses beside Thao, who keeps walking until Spider exits the vehicle. As the white car drives off, Thao continues on his path.\n\nLater, Thao is found gardening while his sister Sue sits on the front steps, immersed in a book.",
    "1103": "As she ascends the stairs, a group of boys trail behind her. Walt approaches Thao, casually sipping his drink, but Thao averts his gaze. Frustrated, Walt strides away, leaving Thao appearing both dejected and pensive. Walt then mows his front lawn with a push mower, pausing to look up and notice two Hmong neighbors approaching his house with flowers in hand. The neighbors offer a smile as they leave the flowers, and Walt resumes his mowing, briefly stopping to glance back at them.\n\nLater, Walt opens his door to more neighbors, this time bringing food. He sniffs the dish before warmly inviting the three women inside, following them in. Upon returning home, Walt drives into his driveway to find Sue, Thao, and their mother awaiting him. He promptly shoos them away. Sitting on his porch, Walt sips his coffee and stands as a sheepish Thao approaches. Walt leaves him alone and heads towards his garage.\n\nThao later discovers Walt observing his abatis border, appearing thoughtful yet shrugging off any deeper thoughts. Walt's attention shifts to a dilapidated house across the street, where Thao is seen up a ladder, working on repairs. As Thao removes a louvered shutter from the roof, Walt and a Hmong neighbor watch from across the street. In the garden, Thao uproots a dead tree and loads rubble into a wheelbarrow, all under the watchful eyes of Walt, who is chewing tobacco, and Daisy.\n\nContinuing the renovation, Thao mounts the house number onto a post on the porch. Walt, puffing on a cigarette, watches Thao scrape old paint from the clapboard exterior before applying a fresh coat. Amidst heavy rain, Walt stands on his porch, observing Thao's struggle with an old tree stump in the garden opposite. Smoking another cigarette, Walt sees Thao finally dig the stump out in the relentless rain before collapsing exhaustedly beside it.\n\nAn elder Hmong man and a young girl approach Walt as he sits on his front steps. After their departure, Walt turns to Daisy with a smile. Thao, with a grin and rubbing his blistered hands, climbs Walt's front steps. Inside his bathroom, Walt spits blood into the sink and briefly regards himself in the mirror before heading to the door. He pauses to consider his next move. Thao's smile fades as he turns to leave, but upon turning back, he sees a slight softening on Walt's face. Walt then disappears inside, closing the door behind him, and Thao wanders off the porch.\n\nIn a doctor's waiting room, Walt sits, glancing around at the other patients—an Indian woman next to him, an Indian man and a black woman opposite. A Muslim nurse wearing a headscarf appears, prompting a frown from Walt. Irritated, he rises from his seat. A female Oriental doctor then checks his notes.",
    "1106": "Walt unleashes his fury by punching cupboard doors and then violently kicks a table in his front room, toppling another one as he marches through. Amidst the chaos, Daisy scrambles for safety. Exhausted, Walt collapses into an armchair, blood trickling from his fingers as he gazes into the distance, his face etched with a grim frown. A tear escapes his eye, marking a moment of vulnerability as the blood on his fists dries.\n\nDaisy joins him, sitting beside him in quiet solidarity. Father Janovich arrives, knocking at Walt's door before letting himself in. Walt, meanwhile, lights a cigarette. Father J settles on a coffee table next to an open photograph album, his eyes fixed on Walt. Walt drags thoughtfully on his cigarette, his expression pensive, as Father J rises to fetch four cans from a cool box. Returning, he hands a couple to Walt, keeping the rest for himself. They both take a swig, with Walt taking another shortly after. Their eyes lock in a tense, unwavering stare.\n\nThe next morning, Thao enters Walt's kitchen to find him sipping coffee. They sit at the kitchen table where Walt casts a scornful glance at Thao, who nods reluctantly before getting up and leaving. Walt watches him go. Later, Walt is seen mowing his lawn and then relaxing in the bath, where he lights a cigarette and exchanges a glance with Daisy, seated beside the tub.\n\nMartin comes over to give Walt a haircut, chuckling as he pockets the payment. Walt then visits a tailor for a suit fitting. At church, Father Janovich walks up the aisle, reading a Bible, and notices Walt. They meet in a confessional booth, stepping out afterwards. Walt walks away, looks back at Father Janovich with a smile, and then departs.\n\nBack at home, Walt sits at his kitchen table, cleaning his Colt .45. Thao enters through the back door, picks up Walt's rifle from the table, shoulders it, and accidentally points it at Walt. They proceed to the basement where Walt shows Thao a medal and pins it on him. Walt goes upstairs while Thao secures the chest from which the medal was taken. Suddenly, Thao rushes up the stairs only to find himself locked in the basement by Walt.\n\nWalt, leading Daisy on a leash, walks out of his house and heads to Thao's. He ties Daisy to Grandma's chair on the porch and fusses over her before heading off, leaving Daisy to watch him go. Meanwhile, Sue rises from her bed, her face swollen and bruised, and steps outside. Grandma follows her to Walt's house.\n\nThe scene shifts to Father Janovich, who is with the police outside Smokie's house. They arrest someone, bundling him into a police cruiser before driving away.",
    "1108": "The giant exits the room, leaving behind an air of uncertainty as Harry watches him leave and shakes his head in disbelief. The scene shifts to a pristine white landscape where elegant white horses, their steps high, emerge from a snow-covered forest, pulling beautiful sleighs packed with students bundled up against the chill. Inside the Great Hall, which is festooned with towering Christmas trees, the ceiling mirrors the snowy scene outside. Large snowflakes gently descend above the students seated at the lengthy, gleaming dining tables.\n\nHarry and Ron sit by themselves at the far end of one of these tables until Hermione joins them, bringing her meal and setting it down opposite them. She displays two cakes before them. Ron, with Harry trailing behind, cautiously peeks around a corridor statue to ensure it's safe, then brandishes his crooked wand. As Harry waves his wand, the cakes lift off into the air. Quickly, Harry and Ron conceal themselves as Crabbe and Goyle enter, laden with cakes. Spotting the levitating desserts, they seize them and begin to eat voraciously, smacking their lips and stuffing their mouths greedily. Suddenly, they cease chewing, their eyes roll back, and they collapse onto the floor, unconscious.\n\nLater, in the girls' lavatory, Hermione prepares three glasses of a potion. She distributes them, handing one to Harry and another to Ron. They eye the thick, dubious sludge in their glasses. After adding hairs to the potion, Ron grimaces in distaste. With a clink of glasses, they all drink simultaneously. Ron gulps down his potion and rushes to the nearest cubicle, with Hermione following him. Harry, in agony, drops his glass and clutches his stomach, staggering to the marble sink for support. As he looks down, he notices the skin on his hands starting to swell and blister. Gazing into the mirror, he sees his face erupting similarly. Gradually, Harry transforms into the stocky form of Goyle, touching his new, fleshy face with his plump fingers, pleased with the change. He then sees Ron, now transformed into the chubby Crabbe, emerge from the cubicle. They exchange glances, taken aback by each other's transformations.\n\nIn a dimly lit corridor, Percy Weasley spots them. Draco Malfoy fixes his gaze on Harry, then shifts his glare to Percy, giving him a scornful look. Back in the Slytherin common room, Draco slumps onto a leather sofa. Harry and Ron, feeling uneasy, sit opposite him. Ron clenches his fist, while Harry nudges him to calm down. Draco, staring ominously at Harry, stands up but then, to Harry's relief, backs away. Ron looks at Harry in surprise. Draco takes a small parcel, shakes it, and pockets it, prompting Ron to spring up in response. Harry, noticing Ron's reaction, warns him with a look of dismay. Harry then touches his forehead, feeling his scar beginning to reappear.",
    "1109": "As the movie begins, Ron's hair starts to turn an unusual shade of red. Suddenly, he and others dash out of the common room in a hurry. The scene shifts to the girls' lavatory where Myrtle, a ghostly figure, drifts by nonchalantly. Inside this same restroom, Hermione, still in her school uniform, has been transformed into a cat. Outside, lightning strikes, illuminating the sky briefly.\n\nBack inside the castle, Ron and Harry climb the stairs, only to pause at a landing where they encounter a pool of water. Without hesitation, they splash through it and continue on. Upon reaching the girls' lavatory again, they find all the taps running uncontrollably, water spilling over the sinks. Their eyes scan the room until they notice Myrtle perched high on a curved stone windowsill. Ron reacts with a flinch as Myrtle floats past them. It's then that Harry spots a black leather book, damp and limp, lying on the stone floor. He retrieves it, shaking off the excess water, though the book remains thoroughly soaked.\n\nLater, at his desk, Harry begins to flip through the now dried pages of the book, only to find them all blank. Undeterred, he goes through the book again and notices a name embossed in gold on the back. Setting the book aside momentarily, Harry picks up a quill, dips it into an inkwell, and as he prepares to write on the first empty page, a drop of ink falls and slowly disappears into the paper. Turning the page over, the ink blot is gone. He dips his quill once more and starts writing. To his amazement, his words fade away, only to be replaced by different words appearing on the page. Encouraged, Harry writes again, and another response materializes on the paper. Yet, as he leans back in disappointment, more words begin to form. Suddenly, the blank pages start turning themselves rapidly.\n\nGrasping the book with both hands, Harry stares intently as a bright light bursts forth from the pages, blinding him. As the light fades, Harry finds himself transported back in time, reappearing in a school corridor. He cautiously approaches a wide staircase where he sees a teenage boy in a Hogwarts uniform, staring intently at the landing above. Harry ascends the stairs towards him and follows his gaze to see four people descending with a stretcher, covered by a sheet from which a limp arm protrudes. As they pass by, a man with a long, brown beard appears at the top of the stairs. Harry looks up in surprise and receives a penetrating glance from Dumbledore.\n\nThe teenage boy, identified as Riddle, departs, leading Harry into a wide corridor illuminated by flaming torches. Riddle hurries along until he reaches the top of a narrow flight of stone steps. Harry follows him down into a gloomy corridor with rough stone walls. As they approach a heavy wooden door, Riddle takes out his wand, looks around cautiously, and then forcefully opens the door to reveal a shadowy figure hunched over a large wooden box.",
    "1111": "Harry and his companions swarm into a tunnel, with Harry stooping to enter just behind Fang. Ron, breathing heavily, looks around nervously before hesitating and then following his friend into the cramped, dark tunnel where standing upright is impossible. As they move forward, a large spider unnoticed by them drops from the roof behind them, its silhouette illuminated by the tunnel's entrance light.\n\nThe tunnel gradually widens into a dimly lit hollow surrounded by twisted tree roots. Harry and Ron follow a swarm of spiders across this space until they reach a huge hole in the ground, encircled by crumpled cobwebs. Their guide vanishes into the hole, leaving the boys unable to proceed further; they stop a short distance away. Harry, holding up a lantern, is uncertain of their next move, and both he and Ron back away as several long, hairy legs emerge from the hole. A monstrous spider, as large as a double-decker bus, hovers over the edge of the hole and peers down at them with its hairy face and closely set tiny eyes. The boys stare in awe and shock.\n\nRon stops whimpering and, with a shaking hand, points upwards. Harry looks up to see dozens of large spiders lowering themselves from the tree roots, dangling ominously above them. In a gesture of respect, Harry nods to Aragog. In a sudden move, Harry swings the lantern and then drops it. Both boys pull out their wands as the spiders close in on them.\n\nJust then, the Ford Anglia appears, stopping abruptly with its doors flying open. Fang leaps into the back seat, Ron scrambles into the front, and Harry dives for the passenger seat as the spiders begin their attack. Ron skillfully backs the car around the tree roots and through the narrow tunnel, scattering spiders as they go. The car hurtles backwards out of the tunnel entrance and flies through the air before hitting the ground and coming to a halt, dislodging a lost spider that grabs Ron through the open window. Harry quickly points his wand at the spider, hurling it backwards. Ron looks at Harry with relief, but Harry's eyes suddenly widen in alarm as he sees, through the cracked windscreen, hundreds of huge spiders emerging from the shadowy trees and advancing towards the car, poised to attack once more.\n\nReacting swiftly, Ron starts the car and shifts it into reverse. He turns the vehicle and accelerates, with spiders scuttling close behind as the car jolts away between the trees. The forest floor teems with spiders. In desperation, Harry turns to Ron, who grabs the gear stick. Huge spiders loom ahead, and the boys heave on the gear stick together, causing the car to rise into the air, smashing into a branch and scattering the pursuing spiders.",
    "1115": "Amid the stillness of the Chamber of Secrets, Harry stands victorious over the slain basilisk, its lifeless head a testament to the fierce battle just concluded. He reaches out to touch Ginny's hand, which still clutches the ominous diary. Seizing the diary, Harry flips it open, then lifts the basilisk's Poison Fang high. With a decisive thrust, he stabs the diary, causing Riddle to recoil as a beam of light pierces the hole in his chest. Blood begins to spread across the page. Undeterred, Harry stabs again. Riddle, overwhelmed by the intense light surging from his body, lifts off his feet and clutches his face in agony. Harry raises the fang once more and slams the diary shut before stabbing it with all his might into its black leather cover. In a blinding flash of light, Riddle disintegrates completely, leaving behind only faint sparks that drift in the air.\n\nGinny suddenly awakens, confusion clouding her eyes as she sits up and sees Harry, who is clutching his arm in pain. From above, Dumbledore's Phoenix swoops down and lands gracefully beside Harry, its sad gaze meeting his. The magnificent bird, with its vibrant orange plume, lowers its head and sheds huge tears onto Harry's wounded arm. Ginny watches, her eyes wide with amazement, as the Phoenix's tears cause the vapor to rise from the wound, and the torn flesh begins to knit together. Harry looks up at Fawkes in gratitude.\n\nLater, Lockhart, Ron, Harry, and Ginny cling to each other as the powerful Phoenix transports them to safety, away from the Chamber of Secrets. Back in Dumbledore's study, Ron and Harry exchange looks of amazement. Ron departs as Harry nods thoughtfully. His attention shifts to the silver sword on the desk. He picks it up, cradling it in both hands, and reads the inscription on the blade. Suddenly, the door bursts open, and Lucius Malfoy strides in, with Dobby trailing behind him. Lucius approaches Dumbledore, casting a glare at Harry, who in turn glances at Dumbledore for reassurance. Harry boldly holds up Tom Riddle's diary, prompting a smile from Dumbledore, who then turns his attention to Lucius.\n\nLucius, in a fit of rage, kicks Dobby down the stairs and strikes him with a stick. Harry sets the sword down on the desk and examines the black leather diary once more. He catches up with Lucius in the corridor and hands over the diary. Lucius passes it to Dobby and leans in close to Harry, sneering before turning away. Dobby, still holding the diary, discovers a sock hidden between its pages. Harry, seizing the moment, pulls up his trouser leg to show Lucius his injured ankle. Lucius, enraged, pulls a wand from his stick and advances on Harry. Dobby bravely positions himself between them and, with a swift motion, fixes his hand, sending Lucius hurtling backwards. The triumphant little elf folds his arms and strides away, as Harry smiles in satisfaction.\n\nIn the Great Hall, everyone gathers, and a sense of celebration fills the air. Harry floats between the tables, while Filch stands by the door, striking his cat. At the Gryffindor table, Neville looks around, taking in the scene. Hermione appears in the doorway, a smile brightening her face. Ron and Harry, thrilled at her return, leap to their feet and rush to greet her as she runs down the hall to join her friends, their reunion complete.",
    "1117": "In a magical display, she waves her wand, prompting Harry's glasses to repair themselves instantly. She then escorts him to a bustling bookshop where the Weasley family stands near the counter, amidst a queue of eager customers waiting to get their books signed by an author. Suddenly, a blond man dressed in a blue suit and matching cloak makes a smug entrance, his smile widening as he poses for the camera. Spotting Harry's grubby face in the crowd, Lockhart signals a photographer to pull Harry forward. Nearby, Ron makes a face, clearly unimpressed, as they all head towards the door.\n\nIn the midst of the crowd, a boy with very fair hair tears a page from a book and steps in front of Harry. A man with long fair hair, carrying a snake-topped cane, approaches and touches Harry's forehead. Meanwhile, the Grangers engage in conversation with Mr. Weasley, who takes a moment to look at Ron before removing a book from Jenny's cauldron and subtly slipping two books back into it. Mr. Weasley then offers a reassuring smile to his children. Tension escalates as Lucius turns on his heel and Draco glares at Ron and Harry.\n\nThe scene shifts to King's Cross and Pancras Station where Harry and Louisa hurry along Platform 10, pushing loaded trolleys. The Weasley twins and Percy confidently push their trolleys towards the brick wall between the platforms, disappearing through it one after another. Jenny follows suit, and Mr. and Mrs. Weasley head towards the wall to Platform 9 and three-quarters. As Harry and Ron attempt to follow, they mistakenly head for a different wall on Platform 10, only to collide with solid brick and collapse in a heap of trolleys and luggage. Amidst the chaos, Hedwig flaps her wings, and a porter approaches while Ron looks thoughtful.\n\nOutside the station, a blue Ford Anglia rises unsteadily into the air, catching the astonished gaze of a taxi driver. Inside the car, Ron presses a button on the dashboard, and the vehicle disappears high above London. As the thick cloud clears, revealing low green hills far below, the car suddenly reappears. Ron changes gear, steering the car down towards the railway line where they skim just above the track and over a magnificent stone fire duct. Glancing back in horror, they see the Hogwarts Express right behind them. Ron quickly jacks the wheel to the left, swerving the car away from the track and under the viaduct. The car tumbles between the stone arches, turning over and over until the door flies open and Harry falls out, barely managing to grab the door handle. He hangs on precariously above the train as Ron stretches down towards him. In a desperate reach, Harry grabs Ron's outstretched hand and scrambles back inside the car. Ron turns the wheel as the train thunders on beneath a plume of white smoke.\n\nAs darkness falls, the car's headlights illuminate the towers of Hogwarts School. Ron glances at Harry, whose smile of delight fades as the car's engine falters. Struggling with the wheel, Ron tries to regain control as the car swoops wildly, zooming dangerously close to the brightly lit windows of the Great Hall.",
    "1119": "In a whimsical twist, an envelope transforms into a mouth and turns towards Ginny before playfully blowing a raspberry at Ron. It then self-destructs into countless tiny pieces, scattering gently onto the table. Hermione gazes at Ron with sympathy. In a bustling classroom, the door swings open, captivating the girls. A charismatic figure flashes his teeth while the boys scowl disapprovingly. He taps and then unveils a cage, revealing numerous tiny blue creatures. As he opens the cage door, pixies burst out, scattering in every direction. They wreak havoc, tearing books apart, and lift Neville Longbottom off the ground by his ears, carrying him across the room. Students attempt to swat at the mischievous pixies to no avail. The creatures then suspend Neville by his cloak from the light fixture. The air fills with flying pixies and shredded paper, one of which tugs at Hermione's hair until Harry swiftly brushes it away. Lockhart's spell proves ineffective as a pixie snatches his wand, causing a dragon skeleton to collapse into a heap of bones and dust. In a moment of panic, Lockhart flees up the stairs, pausing only to retrieve a photo of himself from a pixie's grasp before casting a worried glance at Harry, Ron, and Hermione. He then dashes away. Hermione, taking charge, points her wand upward, freezing the pixies mid-air. From his suspended position, Neville looks down mournfully at his friends.\n\nOliver Wood, the Gryffindor captain, leads his team out for an early morning practice and spots the Slytherin team. Ron exchanges a look with Hermione as Draco Malfoy steps forward, drawing Harry's focused stare. Their broomsticks at the ready, Draco narrows his eyes and glares at Hermione. Appalled, Ron brandishes his wand, only to be sent flying backwards, prompting laughter from the Slytherins. Stricken, Ron looks as though he might vomit and indeed spits out a large slug, an action captured by Colin's camera. Another slug follows, and Harry and Hermione assist Ron in leaving as the Slytherins watch, still amused.\n\nInside Hagrid's cozy cottage, he hands Ron a wooden bucket and takes a seat. Hermione rises, walking away deep in thought. Hagrid's expression turns grave as he reaches for Hermione's hand. Her eyes brimming with tears, she manages a faint smile.\n\nIn Gilderoy Lockhart's room, he signs a photograph of himself. Harry, hearing a strange voice, looks up, causing both Lockhart and Harry to scan the room nervously. Exiting Lockhart's room, Harry is halted again by the voice, which seems to emanate from a stone wall. Following the sound, he encounters Ron and Hermione. Harry dashes off, with his friends in hot pursuit, though he remains well ahead. Turning into a wide corridor, he slows down as Ron and Hermione catch up. Abruptly, Harry halts them, and all three look down to find a trail of spiders marching in a line at their feet.",
    "1120": "In a gripping sequence, mysterious creatures scurry across the floor, ascend the wall, traverse the stone window sill, and escape through a crack in the glass. Upon the floor, something else catches their attention. A pool of water mirrors writing on the wall above. Harry, too, notices something different. A cat, as stiff as a board, hangs eerily by its tail from a lamp racket. Students begin to gather at both ends of the corridor. Upon seeing the cat, their gazes turn suspicious towards Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Colin readies his camera to capture the scene, but someone intervenes before he can snap the photo. Draco audibly recites the ominous writing on the wall. Filch, pushing through the curious onlookers, spots his petrified cat and immediately seizes Harry. Dumbledore, upon seeing the writing, gestures towards Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Lockhart fixates his gaze on the suspended cat. Ron shoots a warning glance at Hermione. Snape, observing the scene, remains visibly unconvinced.\n\nLater, the staircases within the school shift, swinging side to side and altering their positions. As the trio ascends, Hermione turns back to address Ron and Harry. A portrait on the wall nods in silent agreement. Inside a classroom, a black and white bird magically transforms into a glass goblet. Ron, with a wave of his wand, inadvertently turns Scabbers into a goblet with a tail that continues to wave. Professor McGonagall watches, her expression uncertain as she surveys the eager students. Hermione's face is marked with concern. Ron, turning to confront a smug Draco, steps outside the classroom.\n\nIn the library, Hermione retrieves a book from a shelf and presents it to Ron and Harry. The Quidditch pitch, surrounded by tall spectator towers adorned with heraldic designs, hosts an exhilarating match. Players soar above the oval arena on their broomsticks, thrilling the crowd below. The Slytherin captain launches the Quaffle toward the goal, only for the Gryffindor Keeper to deftly deflect it. A Gryffindor player, skillfully dodging and weaving, snatches the Quaffle and flies with it. However, it is soon knocked away and passed high to a Slytherin player. Marking an opponent, Harry maneuvers around the back of a tower. Hovering, he watches as a well-aimed pass by Slytherin sends the Quaffle straight through the goal. The Slytherin supporters erupt in joy as the scoreboard updates with new points. Professors applaud the skillful play. The Slytherin captain rallies his team, who then fly in a coordinated formation, their green cloaks billowing behind them. Harry narrowly avoids a wooden bat that swings dangerously close to his head. Lucius Malfoy and Snape observe the match from the professors' grandstand. Both Harry and Draco, as Seekers, hover above the arena, their eyes peeled for the Golden Snitch. A wooden Bludger nearly strikes Harry, prompting a warning shout from his captain. The Bludger, unrelenting, smashes Wood's broomstick into pieces and then pursues Harry relentlessly. Hagrid, engrossed in the match, follows the action through his binoculars. Meanwhile, a new Bludger crashes through a tall tower.",
    "1127": "In a poignant moment at a gravesite, Hermione crouched down and, drawing her wand, traced a circle in the air, magically producing a wreath of pristine white roses. Nearby, Harry, emotionally moved, wiped his nose with his sleeve as he gazed at the grave. Seeking to comfort him, Hermione rested her head on his shoulder. Suddenly, she turned and spotted a dark figure observing them from a short distance. Harry, too, noticed an elderly woman clad in a knitted cape with a hood. She turned and began to totter slowly away, prompting Harry and Hermione to follow her up the street.\n\nHarry paused beside a burned-out, roofless house, peering over the gate at the overgrown garden, his mind flashing back to Voldemort's devastating attack, recalling the sight of both bodies lying on the floor. Amidst his somber reflections, joy briefly flickered within him. They then turned to find the old woman suddenly close beside them. Harry approached her, and she stared back at him intently.\n\nInside a dark house, Harry received a matchbox from the woman, whom he now knew as Bathilda. He lit a candle, casting a soft glow as the wizened old woman studied his face. Over her shoulder, Harry caught sight of something, and as Bathilda's attention shifted to Hermione, Harry held the match up to a framed photograph, revealing an image of the young thief who had stolen Gregorovitch's Elder Wand. Bathilda's gaze then fixed on Harry before she picked up the candle and eased past him.\n\nHermione, looking anxious, was left in the filthy living room. Harry, with the tip of his wand illuminating his path, followed Bathilda up the stairs. Meanwhile, in the living room, the tip of Hermione's wand glowed as she picked up a book with a note attached to the cover, lifting the note to read the title. Turning the book over, she discovered a moving picture of a smirking Rita.\n\nUpstairs, Harry entered a dingy bedroom where the old woman awaited him, her eyes drawn to the locket around his neck. She pointed across the room. Downstairs, Hermione, her wand providing the only light, walked into another dark room, unwittingly disturbing a swarm of buzzing flies. Upstairs, Harry flipped through a photograph album on a dressing table, but the old woman's face suddenly contorted, becoming cadaverous. Alarmed, Harry spun around as she disintegrated before his eyes.\n\nDownstairs, Hermione spotted blood on the ceiling just as a snake lunged at her. Upstairs, Harry fended off the snake with a chair. Hermione tripped and fell, while the snake hurled itself at Harry, smashing him through a brick wall into a child's bedroom. The light on the ceiling swayed as the snake coiled around Harry. He grabbed a brick from the rubble and smashed the snake's head, causing it to slither off him. Harry then hauled himself back through the wall.\n\nHermione ascended the stairs as the snake attacked again. With a flourish of her wand, she struck the snake, sending it tumbling down the stairs. Harry's wand, dropped during the struggle, lay at the top of the stairs.",
    "1129": "Struggling against the chain that relentlessly drags him back, Harry finds himself choking and pressed up against the icy surface, unable to locate the entry point where he had previously submerged. In a desperate bid for freedom, he forcefully hammers the ice above with his hands and kicks at it with his bare feet. Overhead, a shadowy figure treads across the frozen water.\n\nAs his movements begin to slow, Harry's eyes flutter closed just as the mysterious figure slips into the water behind him. A hand reaches out and seizes a sword. Harry is then forcefully hauled across the icy expanse and propped against a fallen tree as the figure, sword in hand, moves away.\n\nRegaining some strength, Harry leans forward to retrieve his glasses and spots Ron standing nearby. He places a locket on the tree, still drenched and shivering. Ron, visibly awkward and avoiding eye contact, braces himself. Suddenly, the locket snaps open, sending both Harry and Ron sprawling to the ground.\n\nAbove them, a massive black cloud swirls menacingly over Ron, accompanied by a swarm of spiders and ghostly images of Harry and Hermione speaking to him. Disturbing visions of a naked Hermione and Harry passionately kissing intensify Ron's agitation. Gripping the Sword of Gryffindor with both hands, Ron charges at a cowering Harry and forcefully strikes the locket. The dark cloud and the disturbing images dissipate instantly.\n\nStaring at the now-open locket, Harry notices Ron kneeling beside him, who releases his grip on the sword. Harry sits on the ground next to Ron, contemplative.\n\nThe scene shifts as Hermione awakens and emerges from a tent, just as Harry approaches. He gestures towards Ron, who responds with a broad grin. Hermione, however, glares at Ron and forcefully yanks a rucksack off his shoulder. Turning back to him, Ron displays the open locket and exchanges glances with Harry, who blinks and looks away. Despite his scruffy and bedraggled appearance, Ron offers Hermione a faint smile, met by her stern, folded-armed stance.\n\nInside the tent, Ron and Harry focus on a flickering flame contained in a jar, while Hermione sits outside. Harry reaches for the jar as the flame momentarily flares before extinguishing. Hermione, seemingly ignoring Ron, hurries past him to speak with Harry and show him Rita's book. Standing shoulder to shoulder with Hermione, Ron raises his hand, only to lower it in disappointment as she glances at Harry, raises her eyebrows, and walks away.\n\nTheir journey continues across a vast heath land, with hills looming in the distance. Ron leads the way, trudging ahead of Hermione and Harry, until they approach a solitary crooked house. As they near, plums eerily float in the air like orange balloons. The top half of the door swings open to reveal Xenophilius peering out. Harry moves forward towards the entrance.\n\nOnce inside, they settle into a cluttered room, each with a mug in hand. They raise their mugs and drink together in unison. Xenophilius then holds up a pendant, and Harry, his expression blank, looks from his friends back to Luna's father.",
    "1130": "Harry and his friends embark on a tense journey, starting with Hermione finding the right page in a book. Tension rises as she glares at someone, perhaps in frustration or anger. Meanwhile, Xenophilius gazes out of a window, seemingly lost in thought, until he shifts his focus to a piece of paper he discovers nearby. With deliberate movements, he sketches a vertical line with a pen, then adds a circle around the lower part of an imaginary wand, and finally encloses both in a triangle, completing a mysterious symbol on the paper.\n\nHarry acknowledges the drawing with a nod, while Hermione shows signs of anxiety. Xenophilius, muttering to himself, is found near a window by the trio upon their arrival. His behavior grows increasingly erratic; he rushes to the front door and holds it shut, looking desperate as he turns to face them. The trio watches him blankly until he approaches Harry, pushing back his hair to reveal the scar on his forehead, staring intently at him.\n\nSuddenly, the calm is shattered as Death Eaters zoom towards the house. Harry, Hermione, and Ron quickly drop to the floor for safety. Amidst the chaos of spells ricocheting off the building, Xenophilius runs outside only to be struck down. Inside, the three friends, gripping each other's hands tightly, disapparate as the house is destroyed around them.\n\nReappearing in a forest, their escape is short-lived. Ron, moving ahead, is halted by a man who suddenly stands up in front of him, followed by the appearance of three others. Among them is Scabior, a Snatcher who had previously detected Hermione's perfume, casually leaning against a tree. Hermione turns and flees, with Ron and Harry quickly dropping their bags to chase after her.\n\nThe group is relentlessly pursued by a growing number of Snatchers, including Scabior. As the chase intensifies, the Snatchers unleash spells from their wands, closing the gap. Harry, looking back, trips and falls but quickly gets back on his feet. Scabior focuses his chase on Hermione while another Snatcher targets Ron, ensnaring his legs with a chain that trips him and binds his ankles. Harry, evading capture momentarily by ducking under a fallen tree, finds his path blocked by another Snatcher, causing him to stumble and then continue running.\n\nNear Hermione, a chain loops around a tree, but she retaliates with an explosive spell from her wand, sending a pursuing Snatcher to the ground. As another Snatcher confronts her, she turns her wand towards Harry, causing him to fall heavily. Amidst this turmoil, a young Snatcher closely pursues Harry.\n\nTheir desperate flight ends in capture. Hermione, in a desperate move, casts a spell that disfigures Harry's face. A Snatcher named Greyback discards Harry's wand, while Scabior menacingly approaches Hermione, touching her cheek and sniffing her neck. Moving towards Harry, Scabior pauses to examine him closely, his wand ready in his hand.\n\nIn a surreal interlude, Voldemort dissolves into a swirling black cloud before Grindelwald, a sight that leaves Harry gasping for breath. As the scene shifts back to their capture, Hermione removes Harry's glasses, signaling their grim reality as prisoners of the Snatchers.",
    "1124": "The movie begins with a striking close-up of two intense eyes staring directly at the viewer. Rufus Scrimgeour, alongside the Minister of Magic, is captured in photographs during a bustling press conference. At her home, Hermione Granger peruses the headlines of the Daily Prophet, absorbing the latest news. Meanwhile, at the Dursleys', Harry Potter's Uncle Vernon hauls a suitcase to his car, observed by Harry from his bedroom window.\n\nThe scene shifts to the exterior of the Weasleys' newly reconstructed home, where Ron Weasley gazes contemplatively over the wreath beds toward the distant horizon. Inside, his mother and sister Ginny bustle about in the kitchen, engaged in their tasks. Ron momentarily glances behind him before returning his attention to the wreath beds.\n\nIn another domestic setting, Hermione's parents relax in front of the television. Hermione, overcome with sadness, lifts her wand; its tip emits a soft glow. Gradually, images of Hermione as a baby and young child in the photographs on the mantelpiece begin to fade away. Tears well up in Hermione's eyes as she notices her image disappearing from every photo around her home.\n\nBack at the Dursleys, Harry's Aunt Petunia sits in the car, her gaze vacant. Uncle Vernon, visibly anxious, scans the sky nervously. Their son, Dudley, clambers into the backseat, and Harry watches them depart, standing alone on the path.\n\nHermione pauses briefly at her front door, then, with her head bowed, she proceeds down the path and strides away along the street, her long wavy hair tousled by a gentle breeze, a small beaded bag in hand.\n\nThe atmosphere shifts dramatically as a Death Eater, cloaked in darkness, soars over the countryside towards a grand manor house nestled within a country estate. The shadowy figure descends and walks towards the gates, which he effortlessly evaporates with a wave of his wand, revealing his sombre face framed by lank, shoulder-length dark hair. Once through, the gates reappear behind him.\n\nSnape enters a stark storeroom and ascends a staircase, arriving at a room where people are gathered around a long table in front of a roaring fire. At the table's end, a woman is suspended horizontally in mid-air. Snape takes a seat near Voldemort. Nearby, a massive snake slithers along the floor next to Pius Thicknesse. Voldemort's attention shifts back to Snape as the suspended woman recoils in fear.\n\nVoldemort moves behind the Malfoys, prompting Lucius to turn and reach shakily for his wand. His hand trembles as he extends it toward Voldemort, who examines it before snapping off its handle. Snape observes this action intently as Voldemort discards the broken piece and menacingly points the wand at the floating woman. She pleads with Snape, who responds with a cold stare. With a flick of the wand from Voldemort, she falls lifelessly onto the table. Draco Malfoy winces at the scene, a single tear rolling from Charity's eye.\n\nVoldemort, now caressing the snake, watches as it glides onto the table, slithering toward the deceased woman, its tongue flicking and mouth gaping wide.\n\nThe movie concludes with a dramatic scene of Albus Dumbledore falling from the astronomy tower, his white hair and robes billowing as he floats gently downwards.",
    "1133": "A bus and a lorry draw near as the scene unfolds. Hagrid, in a daring maneuver, rides inverted on the tunnel roof. Meanwhile, Harry, hanging out of the sidecar, skillfully navigates over the bus and swiftly drops back into the sidecar as the bike returns to the road. Suddenly, Hagrid slumps forward, struck by a bolt fired by a pursuing Death Eater. Reacting quickly, Harry seizes the handlebars and steers the motorbike skyward. Amidst this chaos, Hedwig flies towards them and fiercely attacks the chasing Death Eater. The valiant owl swoops for another attack but is tragically hit by a bolt of green light, tumbling earthwards. The Death Eater momentarily pulls back.\n\nHarry, overwhelmed by sudden pain, cries out as his face contorts in agony. A dark, ominous figure approaches, closing in on them. Harry slumps forward, his jagged scar glaringly illuminated by the bike's headlight. As they speed between two lines of electric pylons, Harry's wand autonomously lights up. The menacing dark figure draws level with them, and the power emanating from Harry's wand collides with an equally potent force of pulsating energy. A swirling vortex of light ascends Voldemort's wand, dramatically illuminating his face. An explosion violently shakes the bike, prompting Harry to press the control button, propelling the bike away as it spews flames. The force of the blast sends Voldemort reeling backwards, and the electric pylons collapse in a cascade of destruction. Harry, Hagrid, and the bike soar upwards, disappearing beyond the clouds.\n\nHagrid regains consciousness and resumes control of the bike. Harry settles back into the sidecar, but the engine fails, sending them hurtling downwards. Molly Weasley hears the sound of their approach as they break through the protective shield around their home. The duo plummets towards the ground, making a jarring landing in a reed bed. They slow to a halt near the Weasley's home, with the bike throwing up a spume of water, thoroughly soaking both rider and passenger. Harry and Hagrid exchange a meaningful look before trudging towards the house.\n\nGinny follows her mother outside, where Lupin is seen supporting George, whose left ear is covered in blood. George is swiftly carried inside and laid on a sofa. Tension rises as Lupin grabs Harry by the collar, pinning him against the fireplace. After a moment, Lupin lowers his wand and releases Harry, stepping back as Harry nods in understanding. Lupin then races out just as Kingsley and Hermione return, the two men initially pointing their wands at each other before Kingsley lowers his and turns to Harry.\n\nA thestral lands, carrying Bill and Fleur. Nymphadora Tonks approaches with another Harry lookalike who transforms back into Ron, prompting Hermione to rush and embrace him. Lupin embraces Nymphadora in a warm reunion, while Harry runs to embrace both Hermione and Ron. Mr. Weasley returns with Fred, who hurriedly runs indoors, followed by an anxious Mr. Weasley. Mrs. Weasley gently strokes George's brow as Fred kneels beside his twin, joining the others who gather around. Ron looks on, filled with anxiety, as Fred leans towards George, pointing to a large wound on his ear. Bill steps forward, his face grim, as everyone looks at each other, stunned by the day's events.",
    "1135": "At a bustling wedding reception, the Minister's gaze shifts rapidly from Harry to Ron, then to Hermione. The marquis glows softly as light spills out, while a vigilant group of men stands guard outside. Lupin casually walks past these sentinels. Harry, stationed in a covered walkway, observes a hovering Snitch nearby. He quickly seizes it and slips it into his jacket pocket before entering the marquis.\n\nInside, Fleur and Bill dance gracefully amidst two rows of guests, with butterflies swirling around them, as Harry's smile broadens. Glasses around the venue magically fill with Champagne. Towering over a nearby table, the dark-haired Madame Maxime stands, drawing an admiring glance from Hagrid. A man with long, white-blonde hair twirls theatrically with Luna Lovegood, capturing Ron's attention. Hermione then enters, enchanting in a sleeveless red dress.\n\nHarry notices Elphias Doge and moves towards him, taking a seat beside him. Meanwhile, Luna's father sports a pendant featuring a triangle with an enclosed circle intersected by a vertical line. An old woman nearby scowls, her expression puzzling Harry.\n\nSuddenly, a brilliant white light appears in the sky, drawing Harry's gaze as he rises to his feet, his eyes locked on the luminous phenomenon. As it advances, the guests instinctively recoil. The light bursts into the marquis, projecting images and voices that momentarily freeze everyone. The visuals fade, and Bill comforts a distressed Fleur. As Death Eaters storm in, Elphias Doge vanishes using apparition.\n\nChaos erupts as the Death Eaters assault the guests. Ron grabs Hermione, pulling her away, while Harry attempts to reach Ginny, only to be halted by Lupin. In a swift move, Harry, Hermione, and Ron apparate to London, landing with Ron and Harry each holding one of Hermione's hands. They navigate through Piccadilly Circus and down a bustling street until they reach a dingy alley, where they pause in a doorway.\n\nHermione reaches into her small, yet bottomless handbag and retrieves some clothes. The trio then settles at a table in a nearby cafe. A surly waitress, adorned with earphones, approaches their table but soon struts away. Two men then enter the cafe, prompting Hermione to indicate her bag. Wands are drawn and fired; one man falls immediately. Hermione and Ron target the second man behind the counter. Hermione dodges his attack, takes aim, and he falls. The waitress, initially stunned by the confrontation, rushes back to the kitchen.\n\nRon activates the Deluminator, which absorbs the light from the cafe's lamps, as Hermione uses her wand to lower the shutters. In a poignant moment, Ron tenderly strokes Hermione's cheek. Hermione then cautiously approaches a dark-haired man in overalls lying on the floor, his body rigid and unmoving. Trembling, she points her wand at him, her arm wavering as the tip glows faintly. Dolohov's lifeless, staring eyes confirm his fate.\n\nLater, the group proceeds through a covered arcade, with Hermione suddenly halting. They continue to Grimmauld Place, where they observe Number 12, a tall terraced house, materialize before them. They then enter the Black family home.",
    "1139": "Harry plunges into a fireplace and is swiftly carried upwards. Hermione and Ron pursue him, with Yaxley hot on their heels. Yaxley manages to seize them during their ascent, causing their faces to twist in discomfort. However, he soon loses his grip on them. Sunlight streams through a dense canopy of leaves as Harry, still clad in Albert's attire, awakens on a bed of fallen leaves in a forest. Noticing the locket to his right, he quickly sheds Albert's coat, scrambles towards it, and retrieves it. Nearby, Hermione tends to a trembling Ron, kneeling beside him.\n\nIn his frantic search through a bag, Harry locates and points his wand, summoning a bottle which leaps into his hand. Hermione administers a few drops of essence from the bottle onto a severe wound on Ron's left shoulder, which promptly seals itself. Her hands stained with blood, Hermione breathes a sigh of relief, then rises and moves away, allowing Harry to take her place beside Ron. Hermione prepares herself, raising her wand. Harry's gaze shifts to Hermione's bag, while a faint light flickers within a small tent nearby.\n\nHarry directs his wand at the locket, from which smoke begins to rise. The trio approaches it, with Ron's left arm supported by a sling. The locket, surrounded by dead leaves, remains unscathed despite Hermione's efforts to affect it. Engulfed in flames, it still shows no signs of damage. The locket is hurled across the clearing, and despite further attempts, it flies even further away, remaining firmly closed and unmarked. Harry, frustrated, stares at the gleaming metal as the flames dissipate. He picks up the locket, slips its chain over his head, and tucks it inside his shirt. Hermione watches anxiously as Harry, after looking at them both, turns abruptly and leaves.\n\nOutside the tent, Harry examines a fragment of a broken mirror. He turns quickly upon hearing a radio being tuned inside. From his position, he catches a glimpse of Hermione in a hollow. He then pulls the locket from beneath his shirt, holding it in his hand; the locket twists, connecting Harry with Voldemort. In the vision, Voldemort confronts the wand maker Gregorovitch, from whom a young thief escapes with a wand. Gregorovitch cowers on the floor before Voldemort kills him. Gasping for air, Harry returns to reality as Hermione approaches him, her concern evident. He glares at the tent, looking impatient, and stomps off.\n\nReaching inside his shirt, Harry struggles to remove the locket and its chain, eventually handing them to Hermione, who examines them before walking slowly away from him, his head bowed. Meanwhile, Hermione remains vigilant by a campfire in front of the tent, standing up upon hearing a sound. Inside the tent, Harry, his head on a table, awakens and glances over at the sleeping Ron.",
    "1145": "Cedric enters the maze through a different entrance. As confused as Harry, he dashes along the narrow paths between meticulously trimmed hedges. He halts, unsure of which direction to take, and eventually opts for a path. As he advances, the path abruptly shuts before him. The hedges on either side merge, trapping him. He struggles through the thick branches that close around him, whipping his face.\n\nMeanwhile, Viktor trudges forward in his sturdy boots, his wand in hand. Harry, hearing a noise behind him, whirls around. Viktor's gaze is distant and unfocused. Fleur, in a panic, sprints between the hedges until she hits a dead end. Overwhelmed by fear, she dashes back along her path, her face slick with sweat as she peers uncertainly down the foggy trail. Startled by a sound behind her, she turns just as Harry hears her scream. Viktor looms over Fleur, who lies on the ground, slightly dazed. He looks up, his eyes clouded. Sinister roots slither towards Fleur from beneath the hedge.\n\nHarry dashes towards the source of the scream. Through the swirling mist, he spots Viktor. As Viktor sweeps the lighted end of his wand towards him, Harry ducks back into the hedge, narrowly avoiding detection as Viktor, his vision obscured, walks past. Harry then searches for Fleur, only to see her vanish under the hedge, ensnared by a mass of twisting roots. Desperate, Harry aims his wand upward, and red sparks burst in the evening sky. A fierce wind whips the branches, sending a flurry of dust and leaves into the air. As the hedges begin to close behind him, Harry sprints and dives through a narrowing gap, landing on the ground.\n\nSpotting a bright object in the distance, Harry makes his way towards it and finds himself on a path between Cedric and Viktor. Suddenly, Harry collapses. Cedric, reacting swiftly, points his wand at Viktor, rendering him unconscious with a spell. He then kicks Viktor's wand away and raises his own, but Harry intervenes. Cedric shoves him aside and dashes off, with Harry in pursuit. They tussle for the lead, grabbing at each other's shirts, pulling each other back, and pushing each other away.\n\nThey catch sight of the trophy. Racing forward, Cedric slightly leads the way as the Triwizard Trophy glimmers through the mist. Suddenly, roots lash out, tripping Cedric. Harry charges past but then halts, glancing back. Cedric is being dragged backward, ensnared by the roots and branches of the hedge, struggling helplessly. The roots tighten around his neck, threatening to strangle him. Torn between the gleaming trophy and Cedric's plight, Harry points his wand. The roots and branches release their grip, freeing Cedric from their hold.",
    "1146": "Harry rushes to aid Cedric, assisting him in breaking free. Shaking and utterly exhausted, Cedric struggles to stand. A fierce gust of wind sends leaves soaring, while hedges ominously advance, closing in behind them. Together, they dash frantically toward the glistening trophy. Upon reaching it, they momentarily halt before it, each seizing the trophy with one hand. Suddenly, it whirls like a Catherine wheel, transporting them to land next to a statue in a moonlit cemetery. Both quickly rise to their feet as Cedric surveys the eerie graveyard surroundings, noticing the trophy now lying on the ground. Overwhelmed by pain, Harry grips his forehead tightly.\n\nWormtail emerges, holding a small, shriveled creature wrapped in a blanket. Reacting quickly, Cedric pulls out his wand but is immediately struck down and killed. Wormtail then uses his wand to levitate Harry into the statue's grasp, where he is firmly trapped by the scythe's handle. Before Harry, a cauldron is positioned. Wormtail tosses the pale, deformed creature into the cauldron, then opens the Riddle family grave, extracting a bone which he adds to the mix. He then unsheathes a knife, severing his right hand and letting it fall into the cauldron. Moving to Harry, he slashes open his sleeve, cuts his arm, and lets his blood drip into the cauldron. The mixture within begins to froth and bubble vigorously. As flames erupt skyward, Wormtail dashes into the shadows, and the cauldron vanishes.\n\nA ghastly, shapeless entity materializes in front of Harry, writhing and twisting until it gradually assumes human form, shrouded in a veil of black smoke that eventually dissipates. Voldemort, now with his head slowly turning, reveals his taut, gleaming gray skin stretched over his skeletal frame, his deep-set eyes and nostrils replaced by narrow slits. He caresses his hairless skull thoughtfully. Wormtail steps out from the shadows as Voldemort, now cloaked in black, triumphantly spreads his arms, admiring his restored human appearance with a slight smile.\n\nWormtail, bowing deeply, presents an item which Voldemort grasps with his long, bony fingers. He then presses his wand against the dark mark on Wormtail's arm, gazing upwards at the looming sky. From the gathering clouds, a twisting ribbon of black smoke descends, splitting into multiple streams, each revealing a death eater clad in black robes, a pointed hood, and a skeletal mask. As the smoke dissipates, Voldemort faces them, unmasking them, and they kneel before him. Lucius removes his hood, revealing himself, as Wormtail's severed hand is magically replaced with one of silver. Voldemort turns his attention to Cedric's lifeless body and then to Harry, pressing a finger to his scar, causing Harry to collapse in pain. Forcing Harry to bow, Voldemort delights in his agony, sending him spinning away. Harry manages to dive for cover, mustering all his courage to confront Voldemort once again.",
    "1140": "A metallic shield bearing the letters \"WB\" emerges slowly from the darkness, setting the stage for a chilling scene. Behind iron railings, a mound of skulls and bones looms ominously. From one grinning skull, the head of a large snake emerges, its tongue flickering as it slithers onto a narrow path. It silently navigates through an overgrown cemetery, its shimmering body gliding along the uneven terrain. The serpent passes a stone statue—a skeleton adorned with huge wings, cloaked, and wielding a scythe. Suddenly, metallic silver letters materialize in the gloomy sky.\n\nAgainst the night sky, a dilapidated house stands silhouetted. In a nearby cottage, a light flickers on as a disheveled old man ignites the gas and sets a kettle to boil. He removes the lid of a teapot and grabs a tea bag, but his attention shifts when he spots a light in the large house. Frustrated, he tosses the tea bag aside, snatches a set of keys from a hook, and exits the cottage, using a large torch to light his path. He stumbles over the uneven ground, eventually hauling himself up the stone steps to the grand wooden door of the house.\n\nInside, his torch beam sweeps across dusty wooden panels and a cobweb-covered grandfather clock. Gripping the wooden banister, he ascends the uncarpeted stairs, the torch casting eerie shadows on the paneled walls. He switches off his torch upon hearing voices from an open doorway. At that moment, the snake slithers through the doorway toward a figure concealed in an armchair. Abruptly, the old man is consumed by a flash of green light.\n\nBack in the cottage, the kettle reaches a boil. Simultaneously, Harry jerks awake, and Ron flops back onto his pillow.\n\nMr. Weasley guides his group through a wood until a boy drops down among them. They ascend a grassy slope as the first light of dawn breaks the sky. They all touch a boot that begins to spin like a Catherine wheel, pulling them into a faster and faster spin until they are enveloped by bright light. Ginny, Hermione, Ron, Harry, and the twins release the boot and land heavily. Harry looks up to see Mr. Diggory, Cedric, and Mr. Weasley descending calmly to earth. Cedric assists Harry to his feet, and they follow the group along a cliff top, overlooking the sea. As the sun rises, they gaze upon a massive campsite below, where jugglers entertain the growing crowd and more tents are being set up. People on broomsticks zoom dangerously close to the ground. Mr. Weasley leads them to a modest two-man tent, which causes Harry to gawk in amazement. Inside, the tiny tent reveals a vast space complete with carpets, beds, and sofas.",
    "1149": "A majestic coach, drawn by seven winged white horses, emerges through a radiant gap in the clouds. As it descends, students eagerly crowd into the school's cloisters, their eyes filled with excitement. Hagrid skillfully guides the horses to land, but quickly dives for cover as the coach sweeps perilously close overhead.\n\nFrom the center of the lake, a tall mast adorned with a slender pennant rises, heralding the majestic ascent of a golden galleon. Water cascades from its decks as it breaks the surface, its huge sails unfurling to catch the wind. The galleon glides smoothly toward the school.\n\nMeanwhile, Filch, the school's caretaker, breathless, dashes down the hall to urgently whisper something to Professor Dumbledore before rushing out again. Elegant girls, dressed in flattering blue silk uniforms that highlight their slim figures, gracefully dance into the hall, accompanied by fluttering tiny bluebirds. Ron stares in awe at the scene, while Seamus is visibly taken aback as the towering headmistress, Madame Maxime, over eight feet tall, strides past, dwarfing even Professor Dumbledore. The visiting group offers a graceful curtsy, and Madame Maxime, adorned with a huge fur collar, extends her hand with a gracious smile. Dumbledore reaches up to kiss it in greeting.\n\nThe hall's atmosphere shifts as the Durmstrang students make a dramatic entrance in their Slavic, military-style uniforms, each wielding a long staff. Sparks ignite as they spin and strike the stone floor, and two students leap forward, executing high somersaults. Amidst this display, a handsome student with close-cropped hair strides by, and Ron recognizes him as his Quidditch hero. Another student impresses with a ring of fire. High Master Karkaroff, distinguished in a long white coat and Russian hat, greets Dumbledore.\n\nAs a storm rages around Hogwarts, a dark, disheveled figure limps through the relentless rain toward the school. Inside, an unexpected incident occurs when Hagrid accidentally stabs Professor Flitwick's hand. Dumbledore steps forward just as another figure limps into the hall during Mr. Crouch's nervous address to the students. Lightning flashes from the enchanted ceiling, but the figure raises his wand, causing the lightning to retreat. Ron identifies him as Moody, whose scarred face and large, protruding false eye, fixed to an eye patch, swivels erratically, finally fixating on Harry. One of Moody's feet is encased in a metal boot, and he takes a swig from a hip flask.\n\nDumbledore, with a gesture toward an ornate, jeweled cabinet, causes it to dissolve, revealing an ancient stone goblet from which a bright blue flame erupts and continues to burn. Outside, the Durmstrang galleon strains at its moorings, while inside the great hall, the blue flame flickers eerily. Igor Karkaroff enters cautiously, ensuring the door closes quietly behind him.\n\nAt the front of the class, Moody writes on the blackboard, then advances toward the students, who display varying degrees of fear and apprehension. Ron looks petrified, and Hermione appears uneasy. Moody, with deliberate movements, removes the lid from a glass jar, scoops out a spider, and with a wave of his wand, causes it to grow larger.",
    "1155": "As Krum confidently strides past in a singlet, a group of girls giggle in his wake. Hermione appears flustered nearby. In a classroom setting, Ron whispers to Harry, only to have Snape clip his ear in reprimand. Fred, in a playful mood, passes a note to Ron and then tosses the crumpled paper at Angelina. With a hopeful gesture, Fred points at Angelina, mimics dancing, and then points to himself, receiving a thumbs-up from her in response. Fred winks at Ron, adding to the light-hearted atmosphere, but the moment is quickly disrupted when Snape swipes at both Ron and Harry with a book. A girl rises, hands her book to Snape, and returns to her seat before stalking off. Snape hits them again, emphasizing his stern nature.\n\nThe serene scene shifts as a blanket of snow covers Hogwarts, setting a chilly backdrop. Harry, with his hands deep in his pockets, runs up the stone steps to the owlery, stamping the snow off his boots at the top. At the door, he nearly collides with Cho exiting, leading to a brief, awkward sidestep. Harry swallows hard, affected by the encounter.\n\nLater, Harry lies moodily in the common room, clutching a golden egg, while Ron is led in by Ginny. The excitement builds as Harry chases after Parvati and Padma on the evening of the Yule Ball. Lights glow from the Durmstrang galleon on the frozen lake, and excited students gather at the entrance to the great hall, the girls in long gowns and the boys in dress robes.\n\nIn his room, Ron adjusts his worn robe and examines himself in the mirror. Harry enters, dressed smartly in a black robe and white bow tie, briefly checking his armpit before looking in the mirror again. On the stairs, Ron hurriedly escorts Padma away, though she follows reluctantly. Harry's attention shifts from Cho, who is with Cedric, to Hermione, who descends the stairs gracefully, looking like a princess in pink with softly curled hair and a shy smile.\n\nKrum, adorned in a dress uniform with a fur-trimmed cloak, clicks his heels and bows to Hermione. She takes his arm and gives Harry an excited wave as the huge doors swing open. The Triwizard competitors and their partners proceed into the great hall. Harry, looking apprehensive, walks stiffly beside Parvati, who waves to her friends while clutching his arm. Padma's gaze fixes on Hermione as snow gently falls from the enchanted ceiling.\n\nOn the dance floor, Parvati guides Harry around, leading to an awkward moment where he lifts her into the air and swings her around. Dumbledore leads Professor McGonagall to dance, and Filch twirls with his cat. Viktor Krum impressively swings Hermione high into the air, while Cedric dances by with Cho. Neville confidently spins Ginny around with ease. Meanwhile, Mad-Eye Moody, exposing his metal leg, sits in an alcove wearing a kilt and a ferret sporran, taking a swig from his hip flask and shuddering. Hagrid approaches Madame Maxime with a wink and a gesture towards the dance floor, inviting her to join the festivities.",
    "1158": "He turns to depart, but Snape looks back with a raised eyebrow. With a resolute air, Umbridge lifts her wand amidst the backdrop of the Forbidden Forest. Harry, catching up with Hermione, notices the frayed end of Gwarp's rope lying abandoned on the ground. Umbridge, appearing disheveled and dirty, steps back nervously as shadowy creatures emerge among the trees. She wags a finger at them, wielding her wand to deflect an arrow aimed her way. She then points her wand at a centaur, causing it to fall with a strangling rope around its throat. The centaur writhes and thrashes as Hermione attempts to release it.\n\nSuddenly, Umbridge is lifted into the air by Gwarp, who is then pierced by arrows from the charging centaurs. He drops Umbridge, who is promptly grabbed and carried off by the centaurs. Harry and Hermione, alongside their friends, race back through the forest towards Hogwarts, where they are met by Neville, Luna, Ginny, and Ron.\n\nMounting the leathery backs of thestrals, the group soars above the pine forest. Harry grips tightly, glancing back at his companions; Luna, flying close behind, offers him a happy smile. The thestrals press on through the stormy night, battling strong winds, until the lights of Canary Wharf and the winding River Thames finally come into view below them.\n\nThey rush through the deserted Ministry of Magic, moving cautiously along a long corridor lined with shiny black tiles towards a blue door at the far end. Inside, they enter a shadowy storeroom filled with towering wooden shelves. Illuminating their surroundings with their wands, they discover thousands of cloudy glass spheres arranged on the numbered shelves. As they navigate the narrow, dark passages between the shelves, the door behind them slides shut.\n\nHarry searches the area with his wand's light and stops to examine the empty floor. Turning to his friends, he notices Neville reading a label beneath one of the spheres. As Harry approaches, the sphere begins to glow, revealing the swirling mist inside. He carefully reaches out and lifts it down.\n\nPositioning himself in front of his friends, they huddle closer together. The tension mounts as a masked Death Eater approaches slowly along the passage. Lucius Malfoy then unmasks himself, and Harry restrains Neville from rushing forward. Dark figures continue to converge from the passageways, prompting the friends to flee.\n\nLucius suddenly blocks their path, forcing them to retreat. Luna is knocked down but quickly regains her composure, raising her wand and making her attacker vanish. Neville, in turn, stuns a Death Eater, only for Luna to pull him away as more Death Eaters appear, blocking their escape routes. In the chaos, Hermione, pursued relentlessly, flicks her wand, causing glass spheres to crash down onto their pursuers.",
    "1159": "The friends reunite, their reunion cut short as Death Eaters advance menacingly. Ginny swiftly points her wand, and their attackers mysteriously vanish. The group finds themselves in deserted passages. Suddenly, glass spheres plummet from the highest shelves, shattering upon impact, causing the friends to look up in alarm. Luna, captivated by the descending spheres, stands mesmerized until Neville grabs her arm, pulling her away as more spheres fall. The group dashes towards a door at the end of a long, narrow passage, just as wooden shelves collapse behind them, sending a torrent of glass spheres crashing down. Crunching over the broken glass, they reach and burst through the door, only to fall into empty space, landing face down beside a large rocky mound.\n\nHarry, still clutching a glowing sphere, looks up to see a stone archway filled with misty vapor atop the mound. The group raises their wands as black-cloaked figures swoop down, swirling around them, trailing dense black smoke. Huddled on the mound, Harry grips the prophecy sphere tightly, cautiously rising to his feet. He spots a scowling Death Eater restraining Luna with his wand at her throat. Scanning the area, Harry sees each of his friends similarly held by grim-faced Death Eaters. Ron struggles against his captor, while Hermione's tightens his grip on her. Lucius Malfoy approaches Harry, hand outstretched. Harry, surrounded by his helpless friends, looks back at Lucius’ hand, conflicted. Nearby, Bellatrix Lestrange holds Neville by the hair, an evil smile on her face as she presses her wand to his throat.\n\nReluctantly, Harry places the glowing prophecy into Lucius' hand, watching as the glass sphere darkens. Lucius holds it aloft in triumph, but a sudden flash of bright light catches him by surprise. Sirius Black punches Lucius, causing him to drop the sphere. Lucius lunges for it, but it shatters upon hitting the ground. Immediately, the Death Eaters release their captives, and Bellatrix vanishes.\n\nFlashes of light herald the arrival of reinforcements; Nymphadora Tonks, Kingsley, and then Lupin join the fray. As a Death Eater advances, Sirius fends him off and pulls Harry to safety. Tonks helps Luna and Hermione. Lucius, drawing a wand from his stick, aims it at Harry, joined by another Death Eater. Shoulder-to-shoulder, Sirius and Harry confront Lucius and the Death Eater in front of the stone archway as other Death Eaters swoop overhead, trailing black smoke. One Death Eater heads for Moody, who taps his stick and hurls the assailant away.\n\nSirius congratulates Harry and disarms Lucius, sending him hurtling backwards. Bellatrix attacks, and Sirius staggers. With a faint smile at Harry, Sirius is drawn away through the stone archway, gradually disappearing into the swirling, misty vapor beyond. Sirius is gone, leaving Harry, distraught, trying to follow him.",
    "1160": "In a gripping sequence of events at the Ministry of Magic, Lupin restrains Harry with a firm grip, preventing him from pursuing Bellatrix Lestrange. Overwhelmed by grief and rage upon seeing Bellatrix's sinister grin, Harry fiercely struggles to break free. As soon as he manages to escape Lupin's hold, he sprints after Bellatrix, who has swiftly vanished around a shadowy corner. The chase leads them through the grand hall of the Ministry, where Harry finally catches up to her.\n\nWith a spell, Harry halts Bellatrix in her tracks, causing her to collapse to the floor in a cowering position. Standing over her, wand aimed directly at her, Harry's neck muscles tense and twist as he grips his wand tightly, hesitating in the moment. Suddenly, Voldemort appears, shifting Harry's attention as he turns to face the dark lord. In a swift move, Voldemort disarms Harry, knocking his wand from his grasp amidst a flash of green smoke.\n\nJust then, Dumbledore emerges from a fireplace, swiftly pushing Harry out of harm's way. In the ensuing chaos, Bellatrix vanishes in another burst of green smoke. The confrontation between Dumbledore and Voldemort escalates rapidly. Voldemort flicks his wand, prompting Dumbledore to retaliate with streams of red light from his own wand, countered by green light from Voldemort's. Their powerful spells collide spectacularly, resembling molten lava erupting in flashes of sparks and flames.\n\nAmidst this intense duel, Harry cowers in fear. Voldemort, with a menacing breath, conjures a gigantic serpent made of fiery red flames, its body twisting and flexing as it lunges towards Harry. Dumbledore manages to hold back the fiery creature, protecting Harry who is pressed against the wall, shielding his face from the scorching heat.\n\nIn a dramatic counterattack, Dumbledore summons a massive wave of water from the surrounding fountain, engulfing Voldemort in a colossal rolling ball of water. Yet, Voldemort bursts free from the aqueous prison. The duel continues with Dumbledore launching a blast of energy at Voldemort, who staggers but quickly returns the attack, sending Dumbledore hurtling backwards. The force of their battle shatters windows, with flying shards of glass tearing the banner depicting Fudge to shreds.\n\nVoldemort's expression morphs into a snarl as he manipulates the jagged glass fragments, sending them hurtling towards Harry and Dumbledore. In response, Dumbledore conjures a protective force field, deflecting and reducing the glass to fine sand. Voldemort's triumphant grin fades as he faces a resolute Dumbledore, who stands protectively in front of Harry.\n\nSuddenly, Voldemort vanishes in a swirling vortex of sand, which brushes against Dumbledore's white beard. The sand on the floor begins to shiver and move towards Harry, causing him to stiffen and convulse violently before collapsing. His eyes, now dark-rimmed and bloodshot, fixate on Dumbledore as he speaks, writhing in agony. Painful images flood Harry's mind: his mother, Cedric lying dead, and Sirius fading away.\n\nKneeling beside the suffering Harry, Dumbledore watches anxiously as Harry momentarily sees himself as Voldemort. As Harry lies still, Hermione, Ron, and their friends enter the devastated hall of the Ministry, stopping in alarm at the sight before them. Seeing his friends, Harry's mind fills with cherished memories of his parents and joyful times at Hogwarts with Hermione and Ron. Meanwhile, Voldemort's sneer lingers, marking the close of this intense encounter.",
    "1156": "As the sun pierces through menacing storm clouds, it casts light upon words formed in jagged metal letters. The heat of the sun is intense, creating a shimmering haze over suburban London. Cars race along a dual carriageway adjacent to a field where the grass is parched and brittle. Within a corner of this field lies a forgotten playground, where Harry Potter, a teenage boy, walks across with purpose.\n\nUpon reaching the playground, a boy dismounts from the roundabout and everyone disperses, leaving Harry alone to sit on a swing, deeply contemplative. It's then he notices his cousin Dudley accompanied by his gang. Reacting swiftly, Harry draws his wand and menacingly presses it against Dudley's throat. Suddenly, the sky darkens as ominous storm clouds sweep in, obscuring the sun completely. A fierce wind starts to howl, sending the gang fleeing. Both Harry and Dudley look skyward as the darkness intensifies and gusts of wind send trash swirling around the playground. Seeking refuge, they dash from the onset of the downpour along a rugged cart path.\n\nStruggling to keep pace, the overweight Dudley follows Harry until they reach a shelter in a long tunnel beneath the road. They pause, panting, in the dim light of yellow lamps that flicker and buzz eerily, casting shadows on the graffiti-laden concrete walls. Their breaths are visible in the cold air as they glance around nervously. Suddenly, a cloaked figure descends upon Harry, seizing him, while Dudley's legs are swept from under him by an unseen force, dragging him across the ground. A skeletal figure hovers ominously over Dudley, while a Dementor confronts Harry, pinning him against the wall with its bony fingers gripping his throat, attempting to extract his life force. Harry fights back as a faint vapor is pulled from his face. Simultaneously, the second Dementor hovers over Dudley, extracting a similar vapor from him.\n\nHarry, in a moment of desperation, retrieves his wand and strikes his assailant, causing the Dementor to release him. Falling to the ground and momentarily losing his wand, Harry quickly reclaims it just as the cloaked figure advances again. With a swift movement, he casts a brilliant light that repels his attacker. Turning his attention to Dudley, who lies defenseless under the other Dementor, Harry casts the same dazzling light, forcing the creature to flee the underpass. As traffic rumbles overhead, Harry rushes to the semi-conscious Dudley, who struggles to breathe.\n\nIn the midst of this chaos, an elderly woman, donned in a plastic raincoat and hat, enters the tunnel, pulling a shopping trolley behind her. Harry quickly tries to conceal his wand. The woman pauses, observing the scene briefly before they proceed to walk home. Harry, supporting the dazed Dudley, makes their way to number four, Privet Drive, where Aunt Petunia is engrossed in watching television.",
    "1162": "In a dimly lit, narrow corridor draped with cobwebs, Harry hesitates before Moody impatiently pushes past him. The others follow Moody toward an open door at the passage's gloomy end, while Nymphadora turns to wink at Harry. She stumbles over an umbrella stand just as Harry glimpses Mr. Weasley, Sirius, and Lupin through the doorway. Nymphadora exits, closing the door behind her, and warmly embraces Harry, examining him closely.\n\nA house-elf, characterized by its skinny arms, long pointed nose and ears, and clad in a ragged vest, emerges onto the landing, dragging a wooden box. With a spiteful glare at Harry, it climbs onto the box to polish a picture frame. As Harry opens a door, Hermione nearly knocks him off his feet, with Ron standing behind her. Harry surveys the bedroom, his eyes widening in surprise.\n\nThe Weasley twins hang a magic ear over the banisters, which catches the attention of Hermione's cat, Crookshanks. He snatches it with his paw and dashes off with it, prompting Fred and George to chase after him. Harry then shares a heartfelt embrace with his godfather Sirius, who holds him close. Underneath a polished frame, Harry's photograph is visible as Sirius looks directly at him and winks.\n\nLater, Ron sleeps peacefully, but Harry's rest is troubled by disturbing dreams. They find themselves on a down escalator in the London Underground, where Mr. Weasley stands stiffly, gripping both handrails. As they near the bottom, he braces himself and steps off unsteadily, followed by Harry. At the barrier, Mr. Weasley mimics other passengers by placing his palm on the automatic ticket reader pad, but the gate remains closed. Harry inserts a ticket into the slot, causing the gates to open. Mr. Weasley leans back against them, slipping through backwards with delight.\n\nEmerging at street level, they approach a red telephone box and step inside. The interior descends beneath the pavement like a lift, replaced by another interior that slides down to fill the vacated space until the box halts. Mr. Weasley opens the door, and they step out into a vast, tiled hall flanked by large fireplaces. The telephone box lift ascends and disappears above them as people emerge from the fireplaces in bursts of green smoke, carrying briefcases and paperwork, joining the bustling crowd of witches and wizards heading to work.\n\nFollowing Mr. Weasley, Harry passes a fountain adorned with grand golden statues and looks up at a gigantic silken banner floating above, displaying a moving image of the Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. They then enter a Victorian lift with metal gates, surrounded by swooping paper airplanes. Kingsley joins them, whispering to Mr. Weasley before the gates close and the lift moves backward and then descends.",
    "1173": "In the classroom next door, Harry suddenly reappears, removing his invisibility cloak. The moonlight, filtering through the snow-covered window panes, casts a mysterious glow over the empty room. Harry's eyes scan the surroundings with curiosity. Through a stone arch, he catches sight of a large mirror framed in carved wood, positioned a few steps down into the adjacent room. As he approaches the mirror slowly, he watches his reflection draw nearer. Halting before it, he attempts to decipher the unfamiliar script etched into the wooden frame, but the words remain indecipherable. Harry pauses, fixated on his own image in the glass. Then, he steps forward toward his mirrored self.\n\nTo his astonishment, two shadowy figures emerge in the reflection, flanking him—a young man and a young woman. Turning around, Harry finds the room behind him utterly empty. His gaze returns to the reflection, focusing on the pretty young woman, and he swallows nervously. She nods and smiles at him. Beside her, Harry's father, radiating kindness, beams at him. Harry reaches out toward them, but his fingers only meet the cold surface of the mirror. As his mother places a hand on the shoulder of his reflection, Harry mirrors the action, placing his own hand on his shoulder. His mother smiles fondly at him again, and Harry looks back at her, his expression tinged with sadness.\n\nLater, Harry pulls the cover off Ron's bed. In the same empty classroom, they remove the invisibility cloak and rush toward the mirror. Harry sits alone on the cold stone floor, his knees drawn up to his chin, staring into the mirror's depths. Suddenly, Professor Dumbledore appears by the window, and Harry rises to his feet.\n\nBundled in a warm black cloak and his red and gold Gryffindor scarf, Harry crosses the snow-covered courtyard, his pet white owl perched on his arm. The beautiful bird stretches its wings. Harry raises his arm, and the owl balances for a moment before launching into the sky. Harry watches as it soars overhead, swooping around the courtyard, then ascends over the grey stone towers of the school, climbing higher and higher until it vanishes into the snow-laden sky.\n\nSometime later, the white owl flies back toward Hogwarts, passing the hoops of the Quidditch goal posts. The snow has melted, revealing green grass beneath, and fluffy white clouds drift across the blue sky.\n\nIn the library, Hermione gives Ron a withering look before finding the correct page in a book. Together, Hermione, Harry, and Ron hurry across the wet grass toward a stone cottage at the forest's edge. Hagrid, wearing oven gloves, greets them at the door and removes something from a pot simmering over the fire.",
    "1175": "As the urgency escalates, a group quickly approaches a desk before turning away slowly and exiting. They find themselves in a corridor where a tense confrontation unfolds; a man fixes a hard stare at Harry, then strides off, his black cloak dramatically billowing behind him. The silhouette of the school against the moonlit clouds creates an eerie atmosphere as Harry, Ron, and Hermione cautiously descend into the common room. There, they notice Neville's toad, prompting Neville to rise from a chair, only to freeze and tumble over backwards. The trio then bundles under an invisibility cloak, leaving Neville behind.\n\nHermione skillfully unlocks a door on the third floor, revealing a harp playing autonomously. Once they remove the cloak, they are confronted by a slumbering three-headed dog. They carefully grasp its massive paw and manage to slide it off the trapdoor. As the dog exhales, the friends stagger backwards. They then lift the wooden cover and peer down into the dark abyss below. Unfortunately, dog drool splatters onto Ron just as the creature awakens, its three mouths opening wide. In a swift move, they leap into the hole, hearing the dog demolish the trapdoor behind them.\n\nLanding on something soft, their relief is short-lived as a plant begins to move. Sinuous tentacles slither over them, entangling their limbs and necks. The boys struggle to break free while Hermione slips out of sight, with Harry following her. Hermione points her wand, and a flash of light obliterates the plant, allowing Ron to join them. Harry casts a disapproving frown at Ron as they proceed through a door into a room lined with solid stone pillars. Small winged objects flutter overhead, and a shabby broomstick hangs in the air. Ron tests a locked door while Harry eyes the broomstick, eventually reaching out to grasp it. Instantly, hundreds of metal keys swarm menacingly around Harry's head. He mounts the broomstick, guiding it upwards until he spots a key with a broken wing zooming out of reach. As it flies toward a high window, Harry pursues it on his broom, successfully grabbing it when it turns back. He tosses the key to Hermione, who promptly unlocks the door. The flying keys, now in a frenzied chase resembling a swarm of bees, pursue Harry as Hermione and Ron open the door, allowing Harry to zoom inside just before it closes, trapping the keys outside.\n\nEntering a room filled with strange shadows, the trio navigates through the gloom, walking slowly past enormous broken stone statues scattered across the floor. Ron surveys the surroundings as torches flare up, revealing a floor patterned with huge black and white squares. Across this vast marble chessboard, great stone chess pieces stand, poised for battle, with fierce warriors blocking their path, swords drawn, ready to defend against any intruders.",
    "1176": "In the climactic chess game, the swords are sheathed as the participants align with the black chess pieces. Ron mounts the stone horse representing the black knight and surveys the chessboard. A white pawn autonomously advances, prompting a look of anxiety from Hermione directed at Ron. Following Ron's command, a black pawn moves, only to be decapitated by the white pawn, marking the beginning of the intense game.\n\nThe game intensifies with a white bishop and a white knight being obliterated. A black pawn falls, followed by the explosion of another white bishop and knight. The white queen launches an attack on a black castle, causing it to explode into a shower of stone and collapse into rubble. After this destruction, the triumphant white queen turns as Ron ponders his next strategic move.\n\nWatching the ruthless advance of the white queen, Harry suddenly grasps the game strategy Ron is employing, and nods in understanding. Taking a deep breath, Ron grips the reins of his horse, closing his eyes as the black horse moves across the board, navigating through the debris of destroyed pieces. Ron casts a nervous glance at the white king, adorned with a silver helmet and gripping a formidable sword with armored hands.\n\nAs the white queen slowly pivots and advances ominously towards Ron's black horse, Ron, trembling with fear, clings to the reins. The queen ultimately stabs the black horse, causing Ron to tumble off and the horse to crash beside him. Hermione quickly steps back to her position, casting anxious glances towards the unconscious Ron. Harry seizes the opportunity to move into a winning position, confidently staring down the white king, whose massive sword clatters to the marble floor at Harry's feet.\n\nHarry and Hermione rush to Ron's side, kneeling beside him. As Harry rises, Hermione, still kneeling, watches him leave. Harry cautiously descends a dimly lit staircase of white stone outside the chest room. As he moves down the stairs, he touches the scar on his forehead and glimpses Professor Quirrell, wearing a turban, gazing into the Mirror of Erised.\n\nHarry touches his scar again as Quirrell intensely stares into the mirror, extending his hand. Despite his reluctance, Harry finds himself drawn towards Quirrell. Looking into the Mirror of Erised, Harry watches his reflection, which stares back at him before reaching into its pocket to retrieve a red stone. The reflection winks, displays the stone, and then returns it to its pocket. Secretly checking his own pocket, Harry discovers something there. As Quirrell grows impatient, Harry steps back, facing the mirror. Quirrell then begins to unwrap the turban from his head.",
    "1177": "A monstrous face emerges from the back of Quirrell's head, its eyes sunken into dark sockets and skin taut over a bony skull. As Harry turns to flee, a wall of fire erupts, blocking his escape. In the mirror, Harry's parents appear momentarily before vanishing. With a red stone clutched in his pocket, Harry surveys it just as Quirrell, flying through the air, spots him and sends him tumbling backward. The luminous philosopher's stone slips from Harry's grasp as he reaches out desperately, but Quirrell's grip tightens around his throat. In a sudden move, Harry seizes Quirrell's hand, startling him. Quirrell recoils, his hand crumbling into grey dust before his eyes. Desperate, Quirrell lunges for the stone, but Harry's hands press against Quirrell's face, which also disintegrates into dust. Horrified, Harry looks at his own hands, then watches as Quirrell reaches out one last time before collapsing into a pile of dust, his body completely disintegrated. Voldemort has vanished as well. Confused, Harry examines his hands again before scanning the area for the philosopher's stone, spotting it lying on the stairs, a small flame flickering within its dark red surface. Harry picks up the stone, gazes at it briefly, and then, with a relieved smile, grips it tightly. As he turns, a swirling cloud of dust forms behind him, and Voldemort's face emerges, screaming and sending a violent wind that knocks Harry off balance. The wind swirls around him like a tornado, whisking him up the stone steps until it dissipates, leaving Harry unconscious, still clutching the glowing, deep red philosopher's stone.\n\nUpon waking in the hospital wing, Harry, his face pale and a bandage on one hand, rubs his eyes. Sitting up, he reaches for his spectacles and dons them, smiling at the get-well cards and the stack of sweet boxes at the foot of his bed. Professor Dumbledore enters, notices the sweets, picks up an empty box, and sits on Harry's bed. Harry touches his scar, and Dumbledore, after touching Harry's head, stands and chews thoughtfully on a piece of candy. Later, wearing his black cloak, Harry walks down a corridor and spots Ron and Hermione conversing on an upper landing. He stops, a happy smile spreading across his face as they notice him, and his smile broadens further.\n\nAt the bank in the great hall, students don their robes and pointed hats. Professor Dumbledore rises at the high table, surveying everyone, while Malfoy smirks. The Gryffindors offer a lackluster applause.",
    "1178": "At the Reptile House, visitors scatter in all directions as a massive snake slithers across the floor, making its escape out the door to freedom. Dripping wet, Dudley scrambles to his feet, only to find himself trapped inside as the glass window has mysteriously reappeared. In a state of panic, he bangs on the glass desperately while his mother screams in horror. Uncle Vernon, spotting Harry laughing, glares at him suspiciously.\n\nBack at 4 Privet Drive, Vernon forcefully grabs Harry by the hair and locks him into the cupboard under the stairs. As tensions rise, a tawny owl flies low over Privet Drive, dropping a letter that lands on the doormat inside Number 4. Harry picks up the mail to find two letters and a postcard; one letter, sealed with wax, captures his attention with its address written in emerald green ink. Still staring at the envelope, Harry walks slowly into the kitchen where Dudley snatches the letter from his hand. Uncle Vernon examines the back of the letter, his gaze falling on the coat of arms, and he stares at his wife in horror, while Harry looks on, confused.\n\nAnother letter is dropped by an owl, this time flying directly into the letterbox at Number 4, as the owl joins two others perched on the TV aerial. Vernon, in a fit of rage, tears up three identical letters addressed to Harry. From his cupboard, Harry peeps out to see his uncle blocking the letterbox. As Aunt Petunia sees Vernon off to work, she notices owls perched on the car roof rack and gently touches his arm. Five more letters are found lying on the path at their feet.\n\nInside, Harry watches helplessly as Vernon burns the envelopes one by one, a sadistic smile on his face as he pokes the fire, turning the letters to ashes. In an attempt at normalcy, Harry hands around a plate of biscuits while Vernon relaxes in his armchair. Peering through the net curtains, Harry sees hundreds of owls perched on the rooftops and cars throughout Privet Drive.\n\nSuddenly, a letter shoots down the chimney, flying past Harry's nose. Vernon blinks in surprise, then covers his ears as a rushing wind fills the room. A flurry of letters cascades down the chimney, covering the carpet and swirling around the room like a snowstorm. Terrified, Dudley jumps onto his mother's lap, while Harry chortles with glee as even more letters hurtle down. Amidst the chaos, Harry manages to capture a letter and makes a dash for the cupboard under the stairs, only to be grabbed around the waist by Uncle Vernon. Meanwhile, Dudley and his mother escape into the hall, staring at Vernon in horror as more letters burst through the letterbox.",
    "1180": "In the opening scene, slender fingers meticulously count stacks of currency. The action shifts to a counter where a clerk lays down his quill. Nearby, Hagrid fumbles in his pocket, extracting an envelope marked \"top secret\" which he promptly hands over. The duo then boards an underground railway, traveling until their goblin guide disembarks. Hagrid passes the envelope to the guide, and together with Harry, they trail the goblin through a dark, oppressive tunnel.\n\nTheir journey leads them to a door where another goblin pauses. Hagrid receives a lamp and in exchange gives the key, which he uses to unlock the heavy steel door. As it swings open, Hagrid illuminates the vault, revealing heaps of shimmering gold coins that leave Harry in awe. In another vault, a different goblin uses his long fingernail to manipulate the lock of vault 713, revealing a small, poorly wrapped package tied with string. Hagrid swiftly enters, seizes the package, and secures it in his pocket, to which Harry nods in acknowledgment. They return to Diagon Alley.\n\nBack in the bustling alley, Harry reviews his list before entering Ollivanders. Inside the seemingly abandoned store, lined with dusky boxes, an elderly man appears on a ladder, descending to peruse the shelves. Mr. Ollivander selects a long, narrow box, bringing it to the counter and presenting a wand to Harry. Upon Harry's gentle wave, chaos ensues as drawers burst open and wand boxes scatter across the floor. A second wand is tried, resulting in a shattered China vase. After a moment of contemplation, Mr. Ollivander chooses another box, this time revealing a slender, polished wand. When Harry holds it, a radiant light emerges, and a gentle breeze tousles his hair. Mr. Ollivander points at Harry’s scar, a poignant moment interrupted by Hagrid knocking on the window, displaying a beautiful snowy owl in a cage.\n\nThe scene shifts to the Leaky Cauldron Pub, where Harry touches his scar, reflecting on recent events. At King's Cross Station, onlookers gawk at the towering Hagrid as he checks his watch. Harry, reading his ticket, finds himself momentarily alone with his pet owl perched atop his luggage. Pushing his trolley, he navigates the station, locating Platform 9 but finding Platform 10 directly beside it. Spotting a porter, Harry's attention is drawn to a family. He follows a woman with a young girl and four red-haired boys. The eldest boy propels his trolley towards what appears to be a solid brick wall, vanishing as he does so, setting the stage for Harry’s next adventure.",
    "1182": "Ron snickers to himself, extending his hand towards Harry, who chooses not to shake it. As tension simmers, Professor McGonagall returns, casting a sharp, warning glance at Malfoy. The atmosphere shifts as the majestic oak doors swing open, and she confidently leads the way into the grand hall of Hogwarts School. The first-year students march down the central aisle, under the curious gaze of the rest of the school, seated at long tables.\n\nHermione, filled with awe, gazes upward at the ceiling, where hundreds of candles magically float mid-air, casting a gentle glow beneath a moonlit sky. The procession halts as Professor McGonagall stops next to a tattered wizard's hat resting on a stool before the high table. Hermione, attempting to quell her nerves, takes a seat. The sorting hat is carefully placed upon her head, and it soon speaks. Overjoyed, Hermione dashes towards the Gryffindor table.\n\nMalfoy takes his seat, and as the sorting hat is about to touch his head, a man with black hair, sitting beside Professor Quirrell, catches the attention. Harry winces, touching his scar instinctively. Ron, stepping forward with evident nervousness, has the sorting hat placed on his head. The hat immediately recognizes him, and Ron sighs with relief as Harry smiles warmly at his friend. Professor Dumbledore watches with keen interest, and Hagrid holds his breath in anticipation.\n\nHarry ascends the platform, sitting on the stool as the sorting hat is positioned on his head. The hat ponders thoughtfully before announcing its decision. Applause erupts, and Hagrid along with the professors join in the celebration. Harry is warmly welcomed by the other Gryffindors, joining Ron and Hermione at their table. Glancing towards the high table, Harry sees Professor Dumbledore wink and raise his golden goblet in salute. Magically, a sumptuous banquet materializes on the long tables, delighting the children who eagerly fill their plates. Ron enthusiastically grabs a chicken drumstick in each hand, biting into each alternately.\n\nDuring the feast, Seamus introduces himself to Harry, who then turns to speak with Ron's brother. Suddenly, a ghostly head emerges from the middle of the table, startling everyone. More spectral figures float around the great hall—a lady with ringlets, a plump man in a monk's habit, and a cavalier sporting a sword and a long, curling wig. They gracefully swoop above the tables. At the Gryffindor table, Percy engages with a ghost, who then floats away. Ron calls out to him, watching as the ghost tilts his half-severed head and then reattaches it.\n\nLater, Percy leads the group upstairs, where the staircases dynamically shift to different positions high above them. The portraits lining the walls come to life; a charming flower girl curtsies and an old man glances up from his reading. As they move along the corridor, Percy stops before a gilt-framed portrait. The large lady within the painting, adorned in ringlets and a pink silk dress, looks at them inquisitively before graciously beckoning them. The portrait swings open, revealing a cozy sitting room warmed by a blazing fire. In the boys' dormitory, uniforms are neatly folded on chairs beside their four-poster beds, ready for the morning.",
    "1183": "In the quiet of the night, while all the boys are fast asleep, Harry remains awake. Seated in his pajamas on the broad stone windowsill, he gazes through the diamond-shaped panes at the moonlit courtyard of the school, his knees drawn up to his chin. Beside him, his pet snowy owl turns its head as he tenderly strokes its soft, white feathers. A contented smile graces Harry's face as he takes in the serene view.\n\nThe next morning, Harry and Ron find themselves rushing to class, already late. As they burst into the room, a tabby cat perched on the teacher's desk looks up at their entrance. Hermione shoots them a disapproving glance as they hurry to their seats. Suddenly, the cat leaps from the desk and transforms into Professor McGonagall.\n\nLater, the dark figure of Professor Snape enters his classroom with a sweeping stride. His eyes lock onto Malfoy, who responds with a sly smile. Harry, diligently taking notes, feels Snape's gaze upon him. Hermione nudges Harry, prompting him to return his quill to the inkwell. Eager to participate, Hermione raises her hand, clearly desperate to answer the upcoming question.\n\nIn the great hall, Seamus peers into a goblet, his face smudged with soot. Owls, carrying mail, flutter through a high window, gracefully swooping among the carved oak beams. They deliver letters and parcels across the hall to their delighted recipients. A parcel is dropped to one of the children below. Ron receives a newspaper and some letters, setting the newspaper aside, which Harry promptly picks up. Neville unwraps a small glass ball that turns red under his curious gaze. Hermione watches both with narrowed eyes, a hint of suspicion in her look.\n\nOut on the school grounds, a neat woman with spiky silver hair strides purposefully across the lawn. Harry's broom leaps straight into his hand, while Malfoy catches his own broomstick. The others struggle to mount theirs. Ron's broom flies up and smacks him on the nose, while Neville's broomstick lifts him unexpectedly into the air. Terrified, Neville rises higher, clinging to the broom for dear life as it swings him in circles and crashes him into the side of a stone tower. The broom spins away, turns again, then dives towards the ground. Madam Hooch, releasing her hound, causes the children to scatter. Neville's broomstick carries him over the statues on the battlements, where his cloth catches on a sword, causing him to drop the broomstick. His cloak tears and he plummets, crashing heavily to the ground. Madam Hooch, her cloak flying behind her, rushes to Neville and gently lifts him up.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Malfoy finds the Remembrall and mounts his broom, flying over everyone's heads. Harry, determined, steps astride his broomstick and zooms after Malfoy in pursuit.",
    "1189": "Buckbeak, with a swift motion, lifts his head, opens his beak wide, and snatches a bat from the air. As the bats scatter, they fly out into the open sky, swooping low over Harry and Hermione's heads. The pair glance back at the majestic hippogriff before their attention is drawn to the distance where they once again witness the fierce battle between a dog and a werewolf near the willow tree.\n\nDriven by fear, Harry and Hermione dash through the dense undergrowth. In their path, the werewolf violently throws the dog against a rock. Harry catches a glimpse of his future self hurling a stone, prompting the werewolf to turn and menacingly advance on him. Amidst the chaos, Hermione emits a loud howl.\n\nThey retreat back through the moonlit forest, their steps faltering over the uneven terrain. Behind them, the relentless werewolf effortlessly lopes in pursuit. Harry stumbles over a protruding tree root, but Hermione quickly assists him to his feet. After a frantic escape, they pause behind the gnarled trunk of a massive tree to catch their breath. The werewolf, close behind, sniffs around before vanishing around the other side of the tree. Warily, Harry and Hermione scan their surroundings and cautiously creep away.\n\nSuddenly, the vicious creature reappears behind them, poised to attack. At the critical moment, Buckbeak, flapping his enormous wings, swoops down and fiercely claws the werewolf with his talons, forcing the creature to slink away. Distraught, Hermione buries her face in Harry's shoulder as a gust of wind scatters the dry leaves at their feet. They look up to see a menacing swarm of Dementors ominously gliding across the sky.\n\nHarry, gripping Hermione's hand, leads the way towards the lake. On the stony shore across the water, he sees his own figure and Sirius lying unconscious. The hooded Dementors fly low over the icy lake, swooping down repeatedly to attack the defenseless pair on the shore. Hovering above Sirius, the Dementors' presence is overwhelming.\n\nDetermined, Harry dashes out from the trees to the lake's edge, points his wand, and channels all his strength into it. The wand pulses with energy, emitting a silver mist that repels the Dementors. The wand's light intensifies, creating a brilliant protective shield that extends across the lake. Despite their frustration, the Dementors swirl above Harry, still attempting to reach the figures on the opposite shore. With increased concentration, Harry forces the Dementors to retreat. Across the lake, he sees himself briefly before collapsing unconscious beside Sirius as the light from his wand fades.\n\nWith the immediate threat averted, Buckbeak flies Harry and Hermione back to Hogwarts Castle. The hippogriff glides over the castle, descending towards the dark tower where Sirius is held. Hermione swiftly unlocks the barred door of his cell. Buckbeak then carries Hermione, Sirius, and Harry away from the tower, beating his massive wings as they swoop towards the ground. As they prepare to depart, Sirius, with a gentle touch, places his hand on Harry's heart and, with a smile, climbs onto Buckbeak's back alongside Hermione.",
    "1190": "On a damp evening, the streetlights' reflections danced on the wet pavement. A man, later identified as Harry, slowed his pace and surveyed his surroundings. Before him lay a children's playground, featuring a patch of worn grass. In this moment, he realized he was alone. Overcome by fatigue, Harry slumped onto the edge of the pavement, his shoulders hunched against the chill and moisture.\n\nAs he sat, the streetlight overhead flickered and extinguished. Within the playground, the swings began to sway as if pushed by an invisible force, the roundabout spun, and a seesaw thudded onto the grass. From the nearby bushes, a massive black dog emerged, its presence intimidating. Reacting quickly, Harry stood, drawing his wand and inadvertently stumbling back onto the pavement.\n\nA bright light then approached, revealing itself as a purple triple-decker bus that halted before him. The conductor, holding a grubby card from which he read, pocketed it and then gazed down at Harry. Meanwhile, Harry, nervous, kept an eye on the bushes. Stan, the conductor, lifted a trunk and ushered Harry onto the bus.\n\nInside, the lower deck housed a row of beds, one already taken. Harry noticed the upper galleries and a chandelier suspended from the ceiling. Stan operated a machine, issuing Harry a ticket, then tapped on the driver's window. A Rastafarian shrunken head, mounted above the driver, let out a laugh. As Ernie, the driver, started the bus, Harry lost his balance and fell onto a bed. Ernie, peering through thick glasses, drove with wild abandon, causing the bus to screech to a stop. During this abrupt halt, Harry's face collided with the window.\n\nAn elderly woman with a walking frame shuffled across the bus's path. While stopped, Harry glimpsed a picture in Stan's newspaper. Suddenly, two London buses charged directly at them. In a swift move, Ernie yanked a lever, and the bus and its passengers slimmed down just enough to slip between the oncoming vehicles. The bus then raced off down a narrow street, with Harry again striking the window and the vehicle bumping into a parked car.\n\nUpon arrival, Tom, the hunchbacked innkeeper of the Leaky Cauldron, greeted Harry with a grin. The purple bus then vanished into the night. Harry followed Tom into the dimly lit pub where a man sat engrossed in a book, while a spoon autonomously stirred in a cup. Chairs in the room magically flipped themselves onto tables.\n\nIn an upstairs room, Harry encountered his snowy owl and the Minister for Magic, Mr. Fudge. As Tom assisted him, Harry called out to his owl. Later, from his window, Harry observed the bustling marketplace below and watched a high-speed train zoom past.\n\nSeeking solace, Harry approached a stack of books near the fireplace. One book, adorned with a hairy cover, staring glassy eyes, and sharp, pointed teeth, started to growl. Abruptly, it went berserk, snapping its covers. It leaped from Harry's grasp and began to nip at his feet.",
    "1192": "In the front row, each singer grips a massive toad. Professor Lupin rises and acknowledges the students with a nod. Hagrid, the towering giant, stands, inadvertently bumping the table. He snuffs out a candle, which then spontaneously reignites. They exit the Hall.\n\nHarry and his companions ascend the shifting staircase, heading toward a portrait of a plump lady who is melodically singing and holding a glass. She forcefully breaks the glass against a pillar, prompting the portrait to swing open, allowing them entry into the common room. A ghost passes through them. The boys experiment with enchanted sweets; Neville takes a bite, followed by Ron. Suddenly, steam erupts from Harry's ears. Through the window, torrential rain beats down, punctuated by lightning strikes. Amid the tempest surrounding Hogwarts Castle, shadowy Dementors drift ominously beyond the school's boundaries.\n\nA small bird navigates the stone cloister, swooping down a grassy incline towards a gnarled willow tree. The tree retaliates, snapping a branch to strike the bird, sending feathers flying. Inside a classroom, a reaction causes a recoil. Outdoors, students trail Hagrid along the sunlit forest's edge to a grassy clearing enclosed by a low wall. Malfoy tenderly strokes his monster book, eliciting a contented purr from it. Approaching Harry slowly, Malfoy fixes him with an arrogant stare before fearfully pointing over his shoulder, causing Harry to whirl around. Malfoy's associates then raise their hooded cloaks. A disheveled Neville stands nearby. Before them stands a majestic creature, prompting all but Harry to retreat. Ron nudges Harry forward, and he advances hesitantly, bowing to the creature. It responds by flapping its enormous wings and bowing its avian head. Hagrid tosses it a morsel. As Malfoy pushes to the front, Harry extends his hand. Nearby, Hermione grips Ron's hand, both appearing slightly embarrassed. Harry gently pats the creature. Hagrid then smacks its hindquarters, prompting it to spread its vast wings and take flight, with Harry desperately clinging to the feathery neck of the hippogriff, Buckbeak. The half-horse, half-eagle creature ascends above the treetops. In the distance, Harry glimpses a river meandering through the valley, lifted ever higher by Buckbeak's powerful wings. They glide between Hogwarts School's towers and turrets, soaring over the rugged hillside. The sun, silvery through the storm clouds, transforms the lake below into a steely gray expanse. As Buckbeak skims low over the lake, one large claw brushing the surface, Harry catches his reflection in the water. Relaxing, he revels in the exhilaration, a broad smile spreading across his face as he stretches his arms wide. Regrasping Buckbeak's feathery neck, the hippogriff's wings lift them away from the lake.\n\nEventually, Hagrid calls them back. Buckbeak descends, using its wings to brake before landing smoothly in a clearing.",
    "1195": "Ron and Hermione trace footprints through the snow to the forest's edge. As they approach, Ron lingers behind while Hermione advances across a clearing, drawn by the sound of weeping. The falling snow muffles her steps. Upon reaching her friend, Hermione kneels, removes the invisibility cloak, revealing a despondent Harry. Nearby, a yellow butterfly dances above the first snowdrops of the season. The Whomping Willow, animated, twists and shakes off its snow-laden branches.\n\nInside Lupin's room, Harry nods in agreement, clutching his wand. Lupin unlocks a trunk, releasing a Dementor. Overwhelmed, Harry succumbs to darkness. Later, Harry, revived by chocolate, nods again as Lupin opens the trunk. A shimmering silver mist erupts from Harry's wand, enveloping him and repelling the Dementor's ominous presence. With fierce determination, Harry compels the creature back into the trunk, and Lupin, filled with joy, snaps the lid shut.\n\nIn the school's quadrangle and later at the lake, Hagrid attempts to skim stones across the water, successfully once, then fails. Overcome with emotion, he throws a stone with force into the lake.\n\nBack in the boys' dormitory, Harry sits up in bed, munching on a biscuit and studying the Marauder's Map by wand light. Nearby, Ron stirs from a troubling dream but soon drifts back to sleep. Harry's attention shifts to the map, tracking Filch's movements before spotting another name—Peter Pettigrew. Astonished, Harry ventures into the corridor, his wand's bright light disturbing an old man in a portrait. As he moves, his own name and footsteps materialize on the map. With caution, Harry probes the shadows with his wand, frequently checking the map. Pettigrew's footprints dart unpredictably across the parchment, seemingly heading directly towards Harry, causing him to whirl around in alarm. He catches his reflection in a mirror, and more portraits protest the intrusive light. Harry taps the map to deactivate it and extinguishes his wand.\n\nConfronted by Snape, Harry is forced to open the map again. Snape touches it with his wand, triggering writing to appear on the parchment. As Harry follows Lupin, the portraits cast disapproving glances at Snape.\n\nIn a classroom, Lupin, upon seeing the Marauder's Map, stares in disbelief. Meanwhile, Hermione, in a fit of frustration, knocks a crystal ball to the floor, grabs her bag, and storms out. The crystal ball rolls after her down the corridor.\n\nLater, on a circular staircase, Harry retrieves the crystal ball and returns up the stairs, then navigates the corridor back to Professor Trelawney's cluttered classroom. Inside, he surveys the room's overstuffed furniture and shelves lined with teacups.",
    "1200": "Jenny carefully removes a gold necklace from a box, but it quickly ends up in Marley's playful grasp as he wags his tail. John, in pursuit, trips over a chair, sparking a lively chase through the living room. Despite Jenny's efforts, the dog deftly evades her, yet John manages to catch Marley, prying the necklace from his tightly closed jaws. In a subsequent search, John sprays Marley's poop with a hose, hoping to recover the lost necklace.\n\nAt a medical visit, a doctor applies a probe and then a gel-covered scanner to Jenny's stomach, examining the area. A fuzzy image soon materializes on a nearby screen, prompting a frown from the doctor who then removes the scanner and leaves the room, leaving the Grogans waiting anxiously. Later, the doctor returns, her demeanor reassuring as she places the scanner back on Jenny's stomach. Jenny nods, her lips tight, as the doctor withdraws, offering a sympathetic smile of apology. Jenny then looks at her husband, who is speechless.\n\nAs they drive down a road lined with palm trees, both are lost in thought. John, trying to break the silence, glances at Jenny. She, without returning his gaze, leans back against her headrest and stares out the window. They continue their journey down the sunny freeway toward the city.\n\nBack at home, John opens the front door for Jenny. Marley excitedly jumps up, but John pushes him aside. Jenny, shrugging, slumps onto the sofa. John, eyes full of concern, turns from filling the kettle at the sink to see Jenny sitting blankly, petting Marley, whose chin rests on her knee. As tears begin to fall, Jenny leans forward, enveloping the big Labrador in a hug. John approaches, sitting next to her, stroking her back soothingly. She leans into him as he continues to rub her arm comfortingly.\n\nA young dark-haired woman arrives, carrying a bag and a suitcase. Marley playfully chases Debbie around the house, attempting to pull off her bath towel, and ultimately wins the game. Debbie then offers sedatives, a necessary response to Marley's next action—eating the sofa.\n\nIn a quaintly decorated twin room, an elderly Irish landlady leaves the Grogans to settle in. John winces at the noise of the springs as Jenny sits on the bed. They share a kiss, nestled under a floral quilt on Jenny's single bed, beneath a portrait of the Virgin Mary.\n\nA yellow taxi pulls up to the Grogans' home, revealing the interior to be a chewed mess with Marley standing at the front door, wagging his tail. Later, he stands, head tilted back, watching the rain through a lashed window before running under the desk where John is working and climbing onto his lap.\n\nEmerging from the bathroom, Jenny holds up a pregnancy kit. John, filled with joy, takes her into his arms and lifts her off the floor. As they sleep, Marley busies himself, chewing some of John's socks, and then head-butts open his food bin, knocking some books off a shelf in the process.",
    "1202": "John strolls down the front pathway of his house, adorned with a pool and palm trees. A large, shiny new car catches his eye in the driveway. With a stern look, he stoops to collect the newspapers scattered on the drive. Inside, while cradling a baby, John sharply reprimands Marley, the dog, who has his paws on the breakfast table, eyeing Patrick's food with keen interest. John's frown deepens at the scene, which someone captures on camera.\n\nReturning home at night, John drives his old blue Honda, parking it behind their new people carrier. With a gloomy expression, he looks up to see Jenny through the window, holding their baby while Marley playfully bounces around them. Thoughtfully, John leans back in his car's driver seat. Jenny notices him from inside and signals for him to come in, questioning his hesitation. Reluctantly, John exits the car and enters the house with a blank expression.\n\nInside, Jenny and Patrick sit silently and sullenly at the table as John tends to the baby. Nearby, Marley watches Patrick's food closely, while Jenny tries to take a book away from him. John shakes his head disapprovingly as Marley tears into the book. Later that evening, Jenny gently tucks the baby into his cot, then kisses Patrick goodnight in his cozy bed. She closes the blinds and quietly exits the room, pulling the door shut behind her.\n\nBarefoot, Jenny walks softly to her and John's bedroom, where Marley lies on their bed. She places a pillow next to the dog and lies down, with Marley resting his head in her lap, tail wagging gently. Frustrated, Jenny claps her hands to her face. In a sudden burst of energy, she stomps to the boys' room, while Marley excitedly dashes from window to window, accidentally knocking over a lamp and tearing down a blind. Jenny then places the baby into his high chair, but Marley, in his exuberance, knocks Patrick over.\n\nWhen John returns home, he finds Marley chewing on a toy on the sofa. John hands a bag of dog food to Sebastian amid a pile of boxes. As John looks out the window at the cityscape, Sebastian nods awkwardly. Back at home, John enters to find Jenny dozing on the sofa. He sits opposite her; she watches him and shakes her head, while John offers her a quizzical smile.\n\nIn a heartwarming scene, Jenny holds a newborn baby, smiling as a nurse wheels her out. Meanwhile, Colleen sleeps peacefully in a swinging seat as the rest of the family, including Marley, enjoy a playful game of ball in the pool. Inside the house, John picks up the phone in the kitchen. Later, he steps outside, wearing only a towel.\n\nJohn and Marley enjoy a run on the beach, passing by a tanned young woman in a skimpy bikini. John eventually pauses to catch his breath.",
    "1203": "John surveys the beach, observing other dog owners managing their pets on leashes. He then releases Marley, who dashes towards the sea. A woman in a bikini, her skin bronzed by the sun, smiles and frees her boxer, inspiring others to do the same. A large Rottweiler charges into the waves, and John watches with amusement as the dogs frolic together in the shallow water, more dogs joining the playful scene. An owner tosses a Frisbee to his border collie amidst the joyful splashing. However, the mood shifts as the woman in the bikini appears concerned; Marley is circling, about to relieve himself. The other owners watch in dismay, and the Rottweiler's owner closes his eyes in shock as John makes a desperate lunge for Marley. The Rottweiler's owner then calls his dog back, and a police 4x4 drives onto the beach, its officers emerging in casual shorts and ball caps.\n\nAs night falls, John and Marley arrive home in their Volvo and enter their dark house. John, filled with a mix of embarrassment and joy, scoops up his son Connor as both boys rush to greet him. Jenny approaches, cradling Colleen, kisses John, and presents a large square cake adorned with candles. Marley, seizing the moment, places his paws on the table and begins devouring the cake. The pool, decorated with floating flower candles, sets a serene backdrop. John feeds Marley some of the cake, enhancing the lighthearted atmosphere. Amidst the festivities, Jenny sheds her dress, grinning as she stands bare in front of John. She takes a running leap into the pool, splashing joyfully. John, smiling, unbuttons his shirt and follows with a cannonball, swimming towards her. They embrace in the water, their intimacy undisturbed as Marley swims by.\n\nAt his workplace, John packs his desk into a box and carries it under his arm towards Arnie, who waits outside his office. He offers Arnie a comforting pat on the shoulder, receiving a half-hug in return. With a grin, John departs. The family's journey continues in their people carrier through verdant fields and thick woodlands. Marley, eager and excited, leans out the window as they drive down a rural road. Upon arriving at their new home, a large stone-built house, Marley rushes up the steps and inadvertently headbutts a stone bird table, knocking it off the porch.\n\nBack at the Philadelphia Inquirer's expansive offices, John works at his desk. Later, he joins his family and Marley at their bedroom window, gazing at the snow-covered garden. Bundled up, they venture outside, initiating a lively snowball fight. The fun escalates as Jenny and John pull the children on a sledge, Marley trotting alongside. The merriment is briefly interrupted when little Colleen falls off, and Marley playfully attacks their snowman. Amidst the chaos, John and Jenny exchange a warm smile and embrace.\n\nAs the day ends, John ascends the stairs and turns off the lights. He peeks into Colleen's room, watching her sleep peacefully, then checks on his sons in their bunk beds, ensuring all is well before retiring for the night.",
    "1207": "As the mercenaries synchronize their watches under the eerie red glow, Lewis discreetly pulls a hood over his head, blending into the shadows. The team, with Rambo among them, gears up for action. Meanwhile, School Boy, his head concealed by a black hat, stealthily ascends the wooden steps of the camp's watch tower. He draws a menacing serrated knife from its sheath, ready to strike.\n\nIn the distance, a guard wrapped in a rain poncho spots the approaching truck's headlamps as he takes a drag from his cigarette. Stepping onto the rain-drenched road, he prepares to intercept the vehicle. BN, disguised as a soldier and driving the truck, wears a concentrated frown as they near the camp's guard post. The guard, seeing nothing amiss, waves them through, his cigarette's ember glowing faintly between his fingers.\n\nOn the watch tower, School Boy silently approaches the unsuspecting lookout seated in a chair. With swift precision, he muffles the guard's mouth and drives his serrated blade into him. After securing the area, he rests his rifle on the tower's timbers. Inside the moving truck, Rambo's bandana and eye-line are briefly reflected in BN's driving mirror.\n\nAs the truck continues its path, Rambo signals to Reese, who promptly leaps off, rolls across the ground, and hides. En-Joo follows suit, jumping off the truck and dashing around a hut with his weapon at the ready, quickly taking cover. Rambo, touching Lewis's shoulder, signals him to jump; Lewis, his face still hooded, lands between two huts and seeks cover.\n\nMeanwhile, the troops are distracted by an exotic dance performance, oblivious to the unfolding infiltration. Diaz, exiting the truck, lands awkwardly and rolls to a stop. As the vehicle crosses a low wooden bridge over a stream, Rambo jumps off, rolls through the mud, and positions himself beside a hut. Peering through the slats, he sees a figure tattooing another's back with black ink. He then quickly moves on.\n\nAt the dance show, some soldiers sway drunkenly to the rhythm, captivated by the peasant women whose eyes reveal a dull, uninterested gaze. BN stops the truck and exits, pausing near the vehicle's bonnet to survey the scene.\n\nEn-Joo approaches another hut, briefly looking inside to see a man's hands on a nude woman's waist before moving on. Similarly, Reese checks inside a hut but finds nothing of note. Rambo, checking his watch, notes it's seven minutes to two.\n\nElsewhere, a chilling sight unfolds: a man is crucified on a timber frame, with pigs gnawing at his leg. Above him, blindfolded volunteers are confined in a cage. One of the prisoners senses Rambo's approach. Without hesitation, Rambo unsheathes his homemade machete and rushes toward the cage, intent on freeing the captives.",
    "1209": "In a tense and violent sequence of events, a soldier forcibly drags a dancing girl toward his hut. She resists fiercely, but he responds by slapping her, causing her to collapse to the ground. He then gestures toward the hut and crawls beneath it to hide. Unnoticed, En-Joo swiftly silences her with a hand over her mouth and signals for quiet. The soldier, searching for the girl, peers under the hut. In a sudden move, En-Joo attacks, stabbing the soldier repeatedly in the throat until he falls lifeless. He then discreetly moves the body out of sight.\n\nMeanwhile, Rambo rushes to another hut and dives underneath it, spotting Sarah lying motionless in a pig sty. He quickly unlatches a wooden bolt, opens a gate, and crawls in to check on her. Peering through the timbers, he notices a soldier with a bottle of spirits heading back. Sarah appears to be asleep or unconscious. Rambo pushes aside some pigs to reach her, his movements urgent and determined.\n\nAt the same time, En-Joo checks his watch, noting ten seconds until 2 AM. On the watchtower, School Boy targets a soldier in his sights, his watch confirming it's now 2 AM. He pulls the trigger, initiating a series of shots that take down the guard below and those in two adjacent towers. En-Joo and the girl share a quick glance and start moving.\n\nBack at the pig sty, the intoxicated soldier reaches Sarah first and drags her away. Rambo, hidden, watches helplessly before trailing them a few moments later. In a dark clearing outside the camp, BN's group joins En-Joo and the girls. Meanwhile, the soldier forcefully pulls Sarah by her hair, her arms bound behind her, between two huts. Rambo shadows them closely, unseen.\n\nAt a chaotic dance, a soldier throttles one of the women while another trooper charges through the crowd, waving a flare that emits thick red smoke. The smoke permeates the air as a woman's dress is violently torn off, leaving her exposed. Amid this turmoil, another woman is slapped by a drunken reveler. At the same moment, Sarah endures similar mistreatment from a soldier who menacingly reaches for his belt buckle.\n\nRambo, driven by urgency, attacks the soldier from behind, grabbing his hair with one hand and throttling him with the other. The officer's face contorts in agony as Rambo's grip tightens mercilessly on his neck.",
    "1210": "In a gripping sequence of events, Rambo violently rips out a man's throat and hurls him to the floor. As this unfolds, Sarah lifts her gaze upward. Amidst the chaos, soldiers at a dance engage in fights over women. Rambo then guides Sarah away from the officer's hut, navigating through the compound. The dance hut becomes shrouded in a dense red smoke, from which boozy soldiers emerge, staggering and grinning. One soldier playfully taps another on the shoulder.\n\nRambo continues to lead Sarah, this time under a wooden bridge spanning a stream. They take momentary refuge there, observing the heavy boots of drunken troopers passing overhead. Meanwhile, a woman is forcefully dragged from the smoky dance hut. Rambo and Sarah proceed upstream as the festivities conclude and the last of the soldiers drunkenly depart from the dance hut.\n\nEmerging from the stream's banks onto the road, Sarah slips and falls into the mud. Their movement does not go unnoticed; patrolling guards spot them, quickly raising their rifles. In a protective move, Rambo leaps over Sarah to shield her from the impending danger. At that critical moment, School Boy, with precision, shoots one of the guards, then takes aim again, causing the second guard's head to explode. The force sends the guard crashing through a nearby fence to lie beside his fallen comrade. After the incident, Rambo and Sarah depart, while School Boy closes the night-vision sight on his weapon.\n\nAs the rain ceases and the moon emerges from behind clouds, the commander steps out of his hut wearing only a vest. He pushes a small boy ahead of him, watching the boy trudge across the compound before turning back inside and closing the door behind him.\n\nRambo, Sarah, and School Boy then dash through the forest, pausing breathlessly at a tree trunk. Rambo turns to School Boy, and they exchange intense stares before moving on. The golden sun begins to rise over the treetops, illuminating a camp bustling with activity. Tracker dogs are employed to sniff clothing for scents before being hoisted into the backs of trucks.\n\nThe commander, filled with anger, strides out of his hut, exchanges words with a junior officer, and storms across the compound to another hut. Upon entering, he is horrified at the sight of a soldier's corpse lying on the floor, surrounded by blood either wet or caked around the dead man's neck, or pooled on the floor. Shaken, the commander takes a few short breaths and exits the hut.\n\nRambo, Sarah, and School Boy continue their escape, running past a wall of rock.

Amidst this chaos, Sarah and School Boy observe the scene unfold.\n\nFrom a river nearby, the tall boat captain spots the grey smoke rising from the land's explosion and signals with his hand for the boat to move away, which it promptly does. Meanwhile, Sarah and School Boy continue their frantic escape, running down a leafy path. He signals her to stop, and they crouch for cover. Using his rifle as a makeshift telescope by resting it on a tree, he scans the area, and she looks on. They witness escapees being brutally beaten and kicked by soldiers.\n\nFrom their vantage point on a hill overlooking the harbor, Sarah and School Boy see mercenaries and missionaries being assaulted by soldiers, some using rifle butts to deliver blows. The commander oversees the violence, beating the captives with a stick, whipping them mercilessly, and even jabbing it into Lewis's injured leg. The captives are forced to their knees and lined up, hands on heads, facing execution as the troops raise their rifles. Michael stares ahead, filled with despair, while Reese's lips move in silent prayer. En-Joo, defiant, spits on the ground.\n\nFrom above, Sarah and School Boy watch in horror as the soldiers take aim. Suddenly, Rambo, unseen by the gunner on the Jeep, rises and decapitates him with a swift machete strike. Rambo then shoots the Jeep driver with the machine gun, turns it around on its turntable, and begins to systematically target and eliminate the Burmese troops. School Boy, from his position, lines up soldiers in his sights and fires a single shot that pierces through two soldiers simultaneously. Sarah, overwhelmed by the noise, covers her ears as gunfire erupts around them.\n\nThe Jeep driver's remains tumble off the vehicle, and other soldiers suffer gruesome fates; one group is cut in two, another soldier's leg is severed at the knee, causing him to collapse. Amidst the chaos, En-Joo finds a weapon and starts shooting, Lewis grabs a soldier by the leg, pulls him down, head-butts him into unconsciousness, and spits on him in contempt.

Diaz, in a brutal move, twists a soldier's neck and then stabs him. As En-Joo ascends a wooden staircase, he discovers another rifle and immediately starts shooting.\n\nThe intensity escalates when a soldier throws a primed grenade toward En-Joo. Lewis attempts to intervene by shooting the soldier, but the grenade hits its mark. En-Joo's body, bloodied and lifeless, is thrown to the ground. Amidst this chaos, Rambo, also out of ammo, seeks cover behind a gun and finds a box of ammunition. He quickly tears it open and begins reloading.\n\nElsewhere, a volunteer tries to escape but is pursued by the commander, who is armed with an automatic pistol.

Rambo, now reloading, finds himself surrounded by soldiers and ducks to avoid the hail of bullets.\n\nMichael observes a soldier approaching Lewis' position and shooting him in the shoulder. Reacting swiftly, Michael tackles the soldier, and they roll down a small incline.

    "1206": "The film opens with a montage of news images setting the scene. Two large military-style trucks, driven in tandem along a dirt road, approach. In the back of the first truck stands a solitary soldier, while the second carries an entire troop. The trucks come to a halt, and the troops, clad in khaki fatigues and wide-brimmed hats adorned with a gold-colored Burmese military emblem, disembark. Brandishing their rifles, they forcefully order a group of terrified peasants off the truck and onto the road. Amidst this, the troops casually exchange cash among themselves. An officer, sporting dark glasses and a nonchalant demeanor, remains seated in one of the trucks, smoking a cigarette.\n\nA soldier ventures into a nearby paddy field, tossing a primed grenade which lands harmlessly on the wet ground. He repeats the action with two more grenades, which also fail to detonate. Stopping about 100 yards from the trucks, the peasants are then herded at gunpoint to the edge of the field. They awkwardly make their way across the paddy towards the lone soldier. As they advance, the troops watch on with indifference, and the commander takes another drag from his cigarette. Suddenly, an explosion shatters the tense silence as one of the peasants is blown to pieces. The remaining peasants freeze in horror. With a nod from the commander, a soldier gives the order, and the troops open fire, mercilessly shooting down the helpless peasants. The scene shifts to a serene landscape of low clouds hovering over mountains, a verdant valley lined with ferns, and a gentle stream flowing through it. Military-style white text captions appear on screen.\n\nThe focus then shifts to three men engaged in the dangerous task of snake wrangling. A mustachioed local in a baseball cap and striped T-shirt, another man wearing a bandana and red shirt, and John Rambo, a dark-haired, heavy-set, muscular figure with a sullen expression, dressed in a khaki smock and red paisley bandanna. They use sticks with hooks on the ends to probe the undergrowth. A cobra suddenly rears up in the grass, prompting Rambo to gesture to his companions. Together, they encircle the snake as it lunges at them. With skilled precision, Rambo scoops up the cobra by its neck and safely secures it in a sack.\n\nThe trio returns to their small boat, moored on a sandbank where the stream widens into a river. They wade through the shallow water, with Rambo leading them up the boat's gangplank. The boat, silhouetted against the setting sun, sits on a lake. Rambo takes position at the prow, armed with a bow and arrow fitted with a line. He draws the bowstring and fires into the water, expertly pulling out a large fish skewered by his arrow. As they navigate a river, they pass a small canoe carrying two men and a young boy. One of Rambo's friends reaches out and hands the boy a fish, a gesture of kindness amidst their harsh surroundings.",
    "1222": "In a desolate landscape, the ground is strewn with the lifeless bodies of people and animals, a grim testament to the surrounding violence. Amid this scene, a man lies with his head brutally destroyed, and nearby, the skeleton of a child lies abandoned. The air is thick with despair as En-Joo, displaying a moody demeanor, discards his cigarette in disgust.\n\nSuddenly, BN, leading a group of mercenaries, becomes alert to a new threat. They quickly seek cover behind the charred remains of timber frames. Their attention is drawn to a military lorry, its tail covered, as it maneuvers along the edge of a paddy field and comes to a halt. From the back of the lorry, soldiers forcefully push five male peasants into the dirt at gunpoint, positioning them along the field's edge.\n\nAs the soldiers toss primed grenades into the paddy field, one peasant, referred to as School Boy, exchanges a tense look with Diaz, who frowns and casts a glance at a severed head hanging nearby. The tension escalates when one of the soldiers raises his rifle and fires into the air, signaling the peasants to race across the water-filled field. The men, driven by desperation, stumble through the water, their feet splashing in slow motion as they make their way to the other side, where they collapse in exhaustion on the bank.\n\nTheir brief respite is shattered when a soldier, shouting angrily, kicks one of the peasants in the head, and bullets start striking the ground near them. The soldiers, still furious, gesture aggressively for the frightened men to cross the field again. In the ensuing chaos, a soldier aims his rifle, but before he can fire, an arrow strikes him in the back. Rambo, emerging from the trees, continues his assault, firing arrows with deadly precision. Another soldier, attempting to flee, is hit by arrows in the back and head, while yet another is struck in the leg and eye, ultimately falling onto a grenade in the paddy field.\n\nAs the peasants scramble towards BN and the mercenaries for safety, Rambo joins them and engages in a conversation with BN. The tension peaks when Rambo draws an arrow, aiming it directly at Lewis' right eye. The other mercenaries, their weapons trained on Rambo, exchange worried glances. Eventually, Rambo lowers his weapon, and a relieved Lewis turns away from the confrontation. Together, the group moves onward.\n\nThe scene shifts to a military camp under the cover of night, where heavy rain falls relentlessly. Inside the mess hut, soldiers are seen smoking and drinking beer, their attention fixed on a stage where women perform an exotic dance routine. In stark contrast, Sarah languishes in a pig sty nearby, her hair disheveled and her clothes stained, dark bags under her eyes revealing her exhaustion. Through gaps in the floorboards, she watches as the camp's commander paces back and forth calmly.\n\nMeanwhile, the mercenaries have commandeered a soldiers' truck and are being driven along a dirt track towards the camp, with Lewis holding a torch, guiding them through the darkness.",
    "1225": "In a motel room, Ben meticulously shaves off his dense stubble using a wet razor while gazing at his reflection in the mirror. He pauses, examining his visage with a solemn expression. Arriving at Emily's home, Ben parks his car and emerges carrying a gift-wrapped parcel. After a moment of hesitation, he returns the gift to the car and approaches the house on foot. Emily greets him at the door, and a nurse steps out. Inside, Ben, dressed in his usual gray suit, shirt, and tie, enters Emily's bedroom with the gift in hand. The room features a wall adorned with photographs capturing various stages of Emily's life, which Ben studies intently. He then moves to the window, obscured by a delicate net curtain, and observes Emily as she carries a freshly baked casserole to a candlelit table. Nearby, the soft glow of a tea light flickers in the darkness. Ben sets the gift down and catches a glimpse of himself in a full-length mirror.\n\nChanging into a polo shirt and jeans, Ben exits the bedroom and stands at the opened French windows. Emily, seated at the table, nods and smiles at him, gesturing for him to join her outside. Feeling somewhat awkward, Ben approaches the table surrounded by lit candles and looks around. Emily again nods and smiles at him, prompting Ben to shyly scratch his eyebrow. She extends her upturned palm, inviting him to sit. As Ben takes his seat, Emily scrutinizes him with a serious look before nodding encouragingly. Eagerly, Ben picks up his fork, tastes the food, and stifles a slight grimace while maintaining a sincere expression. Emily beams with triumph. They remain at the table as Emily frowns, listening to Ben hum. She shakes her head and moves to a record player, where she falters slightly, takes a deep breath, and places a record on the turntable. Singing along, Emily extends her hand to Ben.\n\nSitting forward in his chair, hands clasped, Ben seems lost in melancholy thought. Emily gently slides her slender hand between his, rousing him from his reverie and pulling him to his feet. He smiles as they dance closely together, with Emily's left hand on Ben's right shoulder and his right hand resting on her back. Their free hands are intertwined as they move slowly, almost in place, their eyes locked in an intense gaze, faces mere inches apart. Ben nods affirmingly.\n\nGuiding Emily into the workshop with her hands on his shoulders, Ben switches on the light and approaches the Beast. Emily opens her eyes, scanning the workshop in anticipation of the surprise Ben has in store for her.",
    "1226": "The Beast gleams radiantly. With a skeptical smile, she approaches. Emily reaches for the switch, her eyes widening in awe as she gazes at Ben while the flywheels begin to rotate. She presses down a lever, activating the machine. Piston arms pump vigorously, deftly picking up paper, positioning it on the platen, and efficiently printing upon it. Emily watches, astounded, before wrapping her arms around Ben's neck and hugging him tightly. Ben gradually responds to her embrace, resting his head on her shoulder, closing his eyes, and laying his hands on her back. A tearful Emily nuzzles into him. Ben then steps back, gently drawing her to him and planting a lingering kiss on her lips. As they continue to kiss passionately, Emily brushes her fingers against Ben's cheek. They momentarily pause, standing with their foreheads touching. Ben pulls back slightly and kisses her fingertips before hurrying out of the workshop. He steps over the low picket fence, unlocks his car, and retrieves a gift.\n\nHis brother arrives. Now as Tim, he goes to his car and reaches inside for an ID, which he hands to his brother, Ben. After putting the gift back in the car, Tim looks sheepish. Ben, the real one, contemplates uneasily. Tim then reaches into his jeans pocket and hands something over. He walks briskly back towards the house, soon breaking into a jog, steps back over the picket fence, and returns to the workshop.\n\nInside, Emily sits in a sultry pose, waiting for him. She stands as Tim enters, shuffling uneasily and reluctantly moving away from her touch. Yet, she draws his face to hers and kisses his cheek. Tim calms a little and allows her to kiss his cheek several more times. Cupping his face in her hands, Emily kisses Tim on the lips. He remains motionless, eyes closed, but gradually begins to kiss her back. Tears roll down his cheeks as they wrap their arms tightly around each other, their kissing growing more passionate. Emily's arms encircle Tim's neck as he lifts her legs and holds her in his arms. They share another kiss before Tim carries her out of the workshop. Still kissing, they fall onto gold satin pillows. Tim, astride Emily, is helped out of his polo shirt by her, revealing a long scar running from his side to his back. In the golden light, Emily removes her delicate sandals and undoes the clasp of her halterneck dress. She and Ben move slowly into a tender kiss. Tim gently places his hand on a scar on Emily's naked breast and kisses it. Outside, rain streaks a window, blurring the image of the kissing couple inside.",
    "1237": "Emily pauses on the steps of her quaint clapboard house, her eyes meeting Ben's. He stands below, gazing up at her with a look of apology. Emily's face shows disappointment; her gaze lingers on him for a moment before she turns and enters her home. Ben remains outside, his eyes fixed on the door. He then walks over to his saloon car, forcefully fastens his seat belt, and lets out a scream of frustration.\n\nInside Emily's home, a middle-aged woman sits at the kitchen table. Emily clears the dishes, taking them to the sink, leaving the woman, identified as the nurse Kate, at the table. Glancing out the window, Emily spots Ben working in the garden, bent over, diligently pulling weeds. She watches him for a moment before stepping through the French windows into the lush garden. Ben continues his work, occasionally smiling as he goes about pulling more weeds. Emily observes him closely, turning back to look at him repeatedly.\n\nBen, with his shirt sleeves rolled up, follows Emily to a set of large wooden doors. She unlocks the padlock, and as they enter, shafts of golden, hazy light illuminate a workshop filled with letter presses. Emily selects a piece of paper, pedals a flywheel, and prints an image of an angelic woman adorned with butterfly wings. Ben studies the vibrant print and meets Emily's gaze, who smiles playfully in return.\n\nIn a sunny field, Emily sits in the long grass, watching Ben play with his dog, Duke, who eagerly retrieves objects. Emily's face glows with glee. They later sit together in the shade of a tree, with Duke joining them. Ben shakes his head subtly, then nods faintly as he watches Emily intently. She wraps her cardigan around her and plays with a blade of grass, occasionally glancing at Ben. Their eyes meet, and Ben nods again. Emily, framed by her long, dark hair, looks away and tucks a strand behind her ear. As she speaks, Ben listens intently, his eyes eventually lowering. Emily looks down, smiling wistfully. Ben reaches out and gently caresses her hair.\n\nDriving along an avenue lined with palm trees, Ben's car approaches Emily's house with Duke's head sticking out of the window. They stop outside. Emily gives Ben a sweet, yet uncertain smile, nods, and then beams before leaning over to kiss him on the cheek. Ben looks emotional. Emily exits the car and helps Duke out from the back seat. She then looks in through the open passenger window at Ben, who watches her depart before turning away pensively, a faint smile crossing his face. He drives off.\n\nLater, Ben sits alone in the sunny field, a smile playing on his lips. His saloon car pulls up outside Emily's house again. He turns off the headlights, unfastens his seat belt, and with a shoulder bag in hand, sneaks through Emily's garden towards the workshop, guided by the soft light emanating from the house.",
    "1238": "In the narrative, grainy footage showcases intense football matches from the past, marked by rough tackles. England's failure to qualify for the World Cup is highlighted, setting the stage for the most sought-after position in the country: the England manager job. Amidst this backdrop, the obvious choice for the role emerges.\n\nOn a gloomy day, rain drenches the muddy pitch of the deserted Leeds United stadium. Inside the stadium, photographers' flashes illuminate the boardroom windows as burly, middle-aged Don Revie, flanked by Leeds board members, transitions from the boardroom to a press conference with a nonchalant wave. Nearby, gaunt and grey-haired Manny Cussins, a board director, sits uneasily before the press, his hand brought to his mouth.\n\nA Ford Zodiac drives along a moorland road, with two boys in the back peering through rain-soaked windows. The handsome driver, Brian Clough, sings along to the radio. They pass by the Leeds United stadium without stopping. Later, inside the Yorkshire television studios, Brian smirks with a wry, lopsided smile. Watching this broadcast at home, an enraged Don Revie storms to the phone and dials.\n\nThe scene shifts back to Elland Road stadium where Brian's Zodiac swings into the car park below the Leeds United AFC sign. A group of boys chase after the car as it arrives. Craggy-faced Jimmy Gordon opens the driver's door, and Brian and his sons exit the vehicle. Brian waves to the footballers training on the field, who scowl back at him through a chain-link fence. He then turns to face the press.\n\nBrian confidently struts into the boardroom, shakes hands with Manny Cussins, and takes a seat at the end of the long board table. Despite the board's glaring at him, Brian's broad grin sets hard, and he beams a toothy smile.\n\nThe timeline jumps back six years to the draw. Brian picks up the phone outside Derby County's rundown stadium, the baseball ground, where elderly groundskeepers note the missing letters on the club's sign. Brian points at the visitor's entrance and marches in through a tatty door. He dashes down corridors past smoking cleaners and onto the pitch, where a groundsman trudges along, marking white lines. From the surrounding streets of terraced houses, grubby kids gaze over the training ground.\n\nOn the field, Brian stands beside tubby Peter Taylor, observing the team. Brian volleys a goal. Dressed in his trademark red tracksuit, Brian sweeps the dingy corridors by the Derby dressing rooms under flickering strip lights. He polishes the brass plaque on the visitors' door, steps back to admire the now-untarnished sign, and then proceeds to the shower room. There, standing in the chest-high plunge bath, Brian scrubs the white tiles with a coarse brush. He meticulously places an orange on each neatly folded towel on the benches and positions a heavy, glass ashtray beside each towel before strolling out. Finally, Brian eyes himself gravely in his office mirror as he smooths his hair.",
    "1239": "Brian meticulously adjusts his tie and gently retrieves two crystal glasses from his case while Peter observes. He places the glasses beside each other on a surface and then delicately unwraps a bottle of red wine. After blowing off the dust, Brian positions the bottle to the right of the glasses with reverence and rotates the label to face Peter, who is standing by the door. Suddenly, Jimmy enters the room. As Brian slips into his suit jacket, he and Peter follow Jimmy out of the wood-paneled office. They rush through a side door of the rusty, corrugated iron stand and head towards the entrance gate.\n\nA coach is parked down the street amidst terraced houses. Brian tidies his coiffed, dark hair and adjusts his tailored suit jacket as he, Peter, and Jimmy stand at the entrance gateway. Further down the street, children gather around Don and his team as they disembark from the coach and walk towards the ground, clad in smart suits, signing autographs. A press photographer captures the moment as the players near. Brian advances to greet them, but Don bypasses him to join his entourage, leaving Brian sidelined at the entrance. Still fuming, Brian watches the teams take to the field and later fixes his gaze on Don in the visitor's dugout. Amidst the chaos of the game, Peter shouts next to a glowering Brian as Leeds players crowd around the referee. The physio carries McFarland off the field on his back. Brian's face contorts in introspection before he sneers at Don. Meanwhile, the wine they had set up remains untouched. Brian observes Don guiding his players onto the coach, patting their backs for the cameras, and he nods with a rueful expression. Tension peaks as Brian jabs a finger at Peter.\n\nLater, the Clough family is seated at a dining table in their semi-detached house nestled in the rolling Derbyshire countryside. Peter exchanges a glance with his wife, and Brian smirks. Barbara Clough rises from the table and wanders into the hall, only to find it empty. Brian then drives away rapidly from Peter's house, with Peter feeding him crisps as they travel. Brian takes a swig from a can of lager before they arrive in a suburban street. Both Brian and Peter share grins as the robust Dave Mackay opens his front door and regards them.\n\nThe scene shifts to Derby players engaging in a training session, hitting a ball and running up and down the stands. Sam Longson joins Brian on the terraces, and there are press shots of the team in their kit. Footage shows Dave Mackay on the training field, followed by grainy black and white match footage of Derby's games as they climb the league table. Brian and Jimmy applaud as Derby reaches the top of the table. Celebrations ensue with champagne flowing in the dressing room, and a party unfolds in the board room. Brian pours champagne from a bottle into a silver cup and then fills the players' glasses. Peter, smoking a cigarillo, embraces Brian, and they dance together as their wives and the team watch. The jubilation is briefly interrupted when Dave rushes to increase the volume on the TV showing Don receiving a trophy. The final scene shows Leeds players in tracksuits training near their stadium.",
    "1240": "In the movie, Brian's sons, Nigel and Simon, are seen drawing on notepads at Brian's desk while Brian observes the players from his office doorway with a look of apprehension. As the team begins their warm-up, Brian's wary gaze remains fixed on them. Accompanied by Jimmy, Brian walks towards the team gathered on the training pitch. The Leeds players, clad in purple tracksuits with their surnames displayed on the back, form a semicircle in front of Brian. Among them stands the stout redhead Bremner, who had previously dived for a penalty during the Derby Cup match, next to the lanky Giles. The players exchange disgruntled glances, prompting Brian to confront Bremner directly, nodding emphatically in response to some unspoken understanding.\n\nThe tension breaks when Jimmy playfully tosses a ball to Brian, who skillfully juggles it with his feet and head before turning and volleying it into the goal. Brian then joins the team in a friendly game, only to be knocked down by Giles. Jimmy quickly assists Brian back to his feet, while Bremner watches on, laughing mockingly.\n\nLater, Brian eavesdrops outside the dressing room before joining Peter on the team bus as it arrives at the Elland Road car park. Inside the dressing room, Brian and Peter share a moment of camaraderie as they follow their teams up the tunnel. Meanwhile, Don is interviewed on television, an event watched by Brian and Peter. In another scene, Brian and Peter observe as Don and the Leeds team disembark from their bus.\n\nThe narrative shifts to the Derby home dressing room where Peter strides in, followed by Brian. The Derby players, dressed in their white home kits, are adjusting their shorts and sitting on benches as Brian surveys them from one end of the room with his arms folded. He then moves to the other end, kneeling in front of a heavy-featured, sandy-haired young player, locking eyes with him. The young man responds with a bashful smile and lowers his head as Brian stands and scans the room. His gaze meets Dave Mackay's, and they exchange a respectful nod. Adjusting his tie, Brian walks over to sit beside a dark-haired, anxious-looking player, mimicking a scared expression before smiling broadly at the team. Brian nudges his shoulder against the younger players, standing before them with a spreading smile.\n\nThe Derby players, now invigorated, leap to their feet and cheer loudly, their faces flushed with excitement. They charge out of the dressing room, sprinting down the dim corridor and up the tunnel to emerge onto the sunlit pitch. As the game starts, the Leeds players, in their away kit of blue shirts and yellow shorts, begin to pass the ball around the field.\n\nIn the final scene, Brian sits alone in his dimly lit office, smoking and watching the clock as sunlight filters through the narrow windows high up in the austere walls.",
    "1241": "At five past four, the clock marks the tense moment as Brian paces in his office, hands clasped behind his head, a cigarette dangling from his lips. His gaze shifts anxiously between the floor and the clock. Suddenly, he looks up in awe as silhouettes of celebrating Derby fans leap to their feet, visible through the frosted windows. The clock progresses to half-past four, and Brian sits, head in hands, overwhelmed by the scene outside.\n\nStanding again, he once more gazes at the silhouettes of the cheering Derby supporters. Overcome with emotion, he bows his head against the wall and continues pacing in the light streaming through the windows, hands still on his head. Composing himself, Brian dons his jacket, straightens his tie, and steps out into the corridor. Outside his office, he smooths his hair and strides down the dimly lit, brick-walled passage. He halts abruptly upon seeing Jimmy and Peter turn the corner. Jimmy strolls away, leaving Peter to frown at Brian, though Peter's expression soon softens into a grin. Overjoyed, Brian rushes forward, embracing Peter warmly.\n\nThe team erupts in cheers within the dressing room. Amidst the excitement, a Telex machine sits idle, and footage from the match plays. Brian appears in a TV interview, opposite a grinning Parkinson. Derby's rise to the top of the league table is celebrated as Brian features in another interview. Crowds eagerly welcome the Derby team bus back home, proudly displaying the cup they've won. On TV, Muhammad Ali makes an appearance, while throngs of people flock to Wembley for the charity shield event, captured in colorful TV footage from the era.\n\nJimmy follows Brian into the Leeds dressing room, where Brian pulls a note from his blazer pocket. The team turns reluctantly to face them, but Brian responds with a grin and a wink. Bremner casts a dour glance at Giles amidst the tension. Both teams emerge onto the field, and as the national anthem plays, Bremner scratches himself disdainfully while eyeing Brown. In the stands, Don sings passionately. On the pitch, Brian remains tight-lipped, but a wry smirk crosses his face as he exchanges a look with Don, who looks away with imperial disdain. Bremner salutes Don from the field, who responds with a smug smile and a touch to his nose. The Leeds team celebrates by jigging in a circle, arms raised to their fans.\n\nThe game intensifies as Liverpool approaches the Leeds area, and off the ball, Giles punches Keegan to the ground. Brian, overwhelmed, shuts his eyes, muttering furiously as commentators observe. Ultimately, Emlyn Hughes lifts the shield, and Brian receives a consoling pat on the shoulder.\n\nLater, at an FA tribunal, a row of gray-haired men in blazers stand up. Bremner exits with the officials, leaving Brian alone, brooding over the events. Back in his hotel suite, Brian is on the phone, with Peter listening nearby. Brian takes swigs of booze as Peter's face contorts with anguish and concern. After the call ends, Brian is left hunched over on his hotel bed, head in hand, deeply troubled.\n\nBy the dressing rooms, Brian nods sagely and leans in close to someone before walking towards the players' tunnel, ready to face whatever comes next.",

Andy watches Emily deliver the coffees to Miranda's office, then hangs up her coat and hurries to her desk opposite Emily's, wearing a vibrant blue jumper. Emily types a message.\n\nNigel presents Andy with a pair of black stilettos. Andy rushes into the room, and Miranda tenses. Miranda's gaze scrutinizes Andy's attire: her plaid skirt, black tights, and finally, her practical, flat black shoes.

Hand-in-hand, they wander beneath the stage's domed archway, their faces alight with smiles of wonder. Carl turns to Allison, who is lost in thought as she gazes at the seats. His eyes linger on her, and when she turns to him, they share a warm smile before looking out at the amphitheater once more. They face each other again, and Allison looks up at Carl before leaning forward to kiss him softly on the lips. She pulls back with an impish smile. Carl responds by leaning down to kiss her passionately yet tenderly, enveloping her in his arms and drawing her close. Allison affectionately squeezes his shoulder, and they remain embraced as they sink to the floor of the deserted amphitheater, Carl eyeing her gravely.\n\nSuddenly, a fat security guard with a torch chases them away. Later, Carl distributes oranges, while people queue outside his office door. Inside, Lee's smile fades, and Norman appears po-faced. A motorbike is visible. Carl and Norman enter an office where a mustachioed man stands; they shake hands. Wesley, Carl, and Norman then sit at a table in the large office. Carl smiles, Norman gawks, and Carl, frowning, stares as Norman nods. In another scene, Carl and Lucy examine bridal shower invitations. Lucy turns slowly to look at Carl, her expression sad, and Carl nods sympathetically. Nearby, Soo-Mi grins, and Carl raises a clenched fist in solidarity. A guy runs into the scene, and Carl joins the crowd.\n\nStanding on the street, Carl gazes into the distance with determination. He rushes into a tall, red brick apartment building and ascends the central staircase. On the top floor, a desperate man stands on a ledge. Carl bursts into an apartment, enters the cluttered living room, and looks around before leaning out of an arched window to observe the casually dressed, portly guy with thick, black hair on the ledge. Inside the room, Carl sees a guitar, which he points at before going back inside. On the street, Soo-Mi and Lucy stand in the crowd, anxiously looking up. Carl tunes the guitar, leans out of the window with it, and begins to play. As the crowd below sings along, a fire crew arrives. The man on the ledge edges closer to the open window. Seizing the moment, Carl grabs him by his jacket and pulls him safely inside, where he lands on his back, holding up his hands in shock.\n\nCarl exits an airport shuttle bus and walks toward the terminal building when Stephanie grabs his arm; she is accompanied by Ted.

Carl frowns, a look of confusion crossing his face as they proceed through the small airport. Their journey continues to the Telephone Pioneer Museum, where they observe a mock-up of an early telephone switchboard and a mannequin holding a modern mobile phone. Carl holds up an impressively large vintage phone.\n\nThe scene shifts to a shooting range where Allison fires at the ground, only for an instructor to correct her aim. She successfully hits a clay target, but as she swings around with the gun, everyone ducks in alarm. Later, they find themselves at the packed Nebraska Cornhuskers Memorial Stadium, where a uniformed band plays and a mascot energetically jumps up and down. The Big Red football team, dressed in striking red-and-white stripes, runs onto the field. Meanwhile, in Carl's apartment, Peter, Lucy, Rooney, and Lee are engrossed in watching the game on TV. Amidst the enthusiastic crowd at the stadium, Carl stands out wearing giant yellow corncobs on his head and arms, while Allison dons a massive red Stetson.\n\nTheir adventure takes a darker turn at a slaughterhouse, where Carl faints. Under a brooding, gray sky in the countryside, they walk along a track. Carl chivalrously removes his jacket and wraps it around Allison's head before leading her to a barn. Inside, he removes the jacket, and she shakes her head, a smile spreading across her face as she falls against Carl, both wrapping their arms around each other in contentment. He rests his chin thoughtfully upon her hair.\n\nBack at the airport, two serious-looking men in suits approach them, showing their IDs. Carl points at Allison and begins to smile. The mood shifts as they find themselves in an interrogation room. Thick-set Tweed narrows his eyes, and Allison looks at Carl with disappointment as they sit handcuffed.

Terrence, pulling back a curtain, is noticed by Peter. Clad in a hospital gown, Terrence exits. Rooney playfully climbs into Carl's bed, silencing Peter with a shush. Carl, eager to leave, rushes towards an elevator as Lee emerges. Quickly, Carl commandeers Lee's Ducati, dons a helmet, and accelerates away, performing a wheelie as he departs.\n\nNavigating the hospital's parking area, Carl smashes through a barrier on the back wheel of the bike. He rides alongside a UPS van, catching the driver's attention as the Ducati's front wheel wobbles precariously in the air. The wheel stabilizes, and Carl speeds through the town, skillfully weaving through traffic and even onto the sidewalk, prompting pedestrians to scatter for safety. A sudden car forces Carl to brake sharply, causing the back wheel to lift before he resumes, wheelie-ing past the vehicle and back onto the road, maneuvering deftly between cars.\n\nAs Carl races along a dual carriageway, his hospital gown, featuring ties at the back above the waist, flutters wildly in the wind, occasionally exposing him. He maintains a low profile with his arms bent, controlling the versatile Ducati. Arriving at a domed observatory, Carl finds Allison leading a warm-up with jogging photographers. He creates a spectacle by doing donuts, enveloping himself in a cloud of burnt-rubber smoke that captures Allison's attention. Removing his helmet, Carl emerges from the smoke with a heavy brow and approaches Allison as her group jogs away. Grinning, he runs up to her at a scenic overlook of the city. Initially frowning, Allison's mood shifts to a smile, culminating in a lingering embrace and kiss.\n\nAs they continue to kiss passionately, Reggie, one of the photographers, raises his hand in apology before joining his colleagues in photographing the couple against the backdrop of the sprawling city.

Seeking solace, Harry closes his eyes and inhales deeply.\n\nNearby, a quaint boathouse stands, a small boat moored alongside it. Inside, Voldemort, alongside Lucius Malfoy, scrutinizes the skin on his forearm, his jaw clenched in tense deliberation. Harry, now breathing through his mouth, reopens his eyes to find his companions staring at him with anxious anticipation.\n\nAs chaos erupts, Death Eaters swarm over the school. A student zooms in on a broomstick amidst the pandemonium, while a giant brandishes a scythe. Battle ensues on the stairs as others fight fiercely. Hermione dashes out through a doorway, narrowly escaping a bolt aimed at her. Harry, pounding on a door, takes down a Death Eater with a swift shot. A giant wielding a two-pronged weapon spots the trio and pursues them relentlessly. Seeking refuge, they squeeze inside a massive bell lying on its side. The giant's weapon strikes the bell forcefully, but the trio's respite is short-lived as colossal spiders emerge, crawling over the rubble. Hermione skillfully navigates between the giants as they fend off attacks with their wands, eventually reaching a quieter section of the battlefield. They halt upon discovering a Death Eater hunched over a girl's body, and the werewolf, Fenrir Greyback, glances up knowingly. Hermione swiftly casts a spell that sends Greyback crashing through a window. The trio continues their desperate run along a closed-end walkway, with the giants smashing through walls in hot pursuit.\n\nTheir flight brings them to the front of the school, where they witness Dementors approaching. Suddenly, a shimmering barrier materializes before them, cast by Aberforth Dumbledore, who stands with his wand outstretched. As Aberforth and his allies turn to re-engage in the battle, the trio sprints away. They race out onto a raised walkway, descending steps towards the lights emanating from the boathouse.\n\nInside the boathouse, Snape stands with Voldemort, who fixes him with an intense stare. Snape manages a perfect smile despite the tension. Voldemort circles him, Snape's eyes never leaving his adversary. With a swift slicing motion using the Elder Wand, Voldemort strikes, sending Snape crashing against a glass-paneled wall. Harry, positioned on the other side, watches helplessly as Nagini lunges repeatedly at Snape, slamming him against the lead-paned glass which trembles but holds firm. Harry and his friends, unable to intervene, are left standing outside, witnessing Snape's bloody hand slide down a window before falling limply to the floor.\n\nEntering the boathouse, they find Snape still alive, his lower jaw trembling. Harry moves toward him, kneeling down beside him to staunch a wound on his neck. As Snape turns his head to look at Harry, their eyes lock in a deep gaze. A tear trickles down Snape's cheek. In a rush, Hermione searches her bag, pulling out a small phial, ready to assist.",
    "1267": "Harry, after glancing back the way they came, rises to see Dumbledore a short distance away, his back turned. Dumbledore spins around, then smiles, raises his eyebrows, and nods before backing away. The old man turns around once more before vanishing into the whiteness.\n\nIn the forest, Voldemort lies on the ground. He pushes Bellatrix aside and spots Harry lying motionless. Narcissa Malfoy strides towards Harry's body, while Bellatrix stares. Narcissa glances back, then leans down to check Harry's pulse. Wide-eyed, she looks down and nods imperceptibly, remaining crouched for a moment before rising and turning to face Voldemort with a solemn expression.\n\nA lone figure, Neville, staggers over rubble in the courtyard, bending down to pick up the Sorting Hat. He dusts it off, holds it upside down, and looks into it, reflecting on his face. Looking up, he sees a slow procession of people in the distance and heads it as it trudges towards the school.\n\nVoldemort moves aside a giant's body that falls from the bridge as a large army of Death Eaters troop across it. Neville, still clutching the Sorting Hat, shuffles forward while Voldemort and Nagini slither into the courtyard. Arthur pulls Ginny back as Ron and Hermione stand horrified, mouths agape. Voldemort turns to his Death Eaters as Lucius calls out, drawing all eyes to his son, Draco. Lucius stretches out his hand, purses his lips, and sets off towards his parents under the watchful eyes of McGonagall and the grim-faced students. Draco joins his parents, with Narcissa putting her arm around him and leading him into the crowd of Death Eaters.\n\nVoldemort's face twitches as he flexes the bony fingers of his left hand. Neville glares at Seamus, his hand on his heart, staring defiantly at Voldemort. As Neville draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat, Harry leaps from Hagrid's arms. His spell bounces off Nagini as he runs for cover. Voldemort uses his wand to shoot fire at Harry, who is alone clutching his wand, while several Death Eaters make their escape. The students run into the school as Shacklebolt deflects the attackers. A flash hits the Sword of Gryffindor, catapulting Neville backwards. The Malfoys make their escape back across the bridge.\n\nHarry, walking backwards, turns sharply upon hearing movement, spinning and firing his wand, hitting a door frame. Three bodies lie on the ground as he runs, with Voldemort apparating at the main staircase. Harry hides behind a wall, clutching a Basilisk fang, then shows himself as Voldemort climbs the main staircase. They fend off each other's energy blasts in a manner reminiscent of a sword fight. Voldemort moves towards Harry with Nagini behind him. Voldemort disappears and apparates above Harry on the stairs. They lock energy blasts as Harry is forced backwards, with Nagini slithering up the stairs towards him.",
    "1268": "In a fierce battle within the castle, a blast is deflected onto the ceiling, causing stone beams to crash down onto the stairs. Amidst the chaos, he steadies himself, gripping the Basilisk fang tightly. Voldemort, spotting the commotion, launches a spell at Harry, who tumbles onto a lower staircase and inadvertently drops the fang. Voldemort quickly destroys the fallen fang before Harry vanishes from his sight. The Dark Lord then dis-apparates, leaving the scene momentarily quiet.\n\nNagini, the menacing serpent, slithers across a landing, her attention diverted as a stone hits her. She turns, peering over the edge of the stairs. Below, on another landing, Hermione stands alone but quickly throws another stone as Nagini descends towards her. Meanwhile, Neville regains consciousness, sitting up woozily, unaware of the intense battle raging around him. A burning body floats past him, prompting him to turn his head and notice the Sword of Gryffindor lying on the ground behind him.\n\nVoldemort reappears, landing to take aim at his opponents, but the walkway beneath him gives way, causing Harry to plummet to the floor below. As Harry tries to scramble away, strips of Voldemort's dark cloak ensnare his wrists and neck, pulling him back. Voldemort forcefully reels him in, intensifying their confrontation.\n\nSimultaneously, Nagini advances menacingly towards Hermione, who steps back, a Basilisk fang clutched in her hand. Ron, also armed with a fang, stealthily approaches the stairs but catches Nagini's attention. He narrowly escapes her attack but drops his fang, leaving it between him and Hermione as the snake rears up, poised to strike.\n\nIn another part of the school, Bellatrix and Ginny engage in a heated duel until Molly Weasley steps in to take Ginny's place. On a narrow platform, the two women exchange energy blasts, with Bellatrix initially gaining the upper hand. However, Molly, fueled by fierce determination, advances and strikes Bellatrix repeatedly. The stunned Death Eater, mouth agape, raises her hands in defeat before Molly delivers a final blow with her wand, causing Bellatrix to explode into countless black fragments. A triumphant grin spreads across Molly's face.\n\nBack on the walkway, Voldemort resorts to physical strength, slapping and kicking Harry, who tries to scuttle away. In a bold move, Harry wraps his arms around Voldemort's neck and leaps off the edge of the high ramparts. They plummet together, Voldemort struggling to break free as they fall through the air, leaving a trail of black smoke that crashes through charred roof timbers. Locked in a battle for supremacy, they claw at each other's faces as they soar over the school grounds. Upon landing in the courtyard, Harry appears to split Voldemort's head open, revealing only smoke as they roll apart across the cobbled surface.\n\nExhausted, they lie on the ground a distance apart, each crawling towards their respective wands. Voldemort reaches the Elder Wand just before Harry grasps his, and they rise to their knees, simultaneously firing at each other. A burst of green energy from the Elder Wand collides with a burst of red from Harry's wand, creating a dazzling white ball of light.\n\nInside the castle, the tension continues as Nagini pursues Hermione and Ron down the stairs. They fall, and Nagini looms over them, her mouth open and ready to attack.",
    "1269": "In a gripping finale, Neville brandishes the Sword of Gryffindor with determination. Amidst the chaos, a cloud of dark smoke envelops Hermione as she lies amidst the debris. The power within the Elder Wand begins to wane noticeably. In the courtyard, Voldemort staggers, visibly shaken. Harry courageously turns to confront him, as fury distorts the Dark Lord's features. A spectacular clash ensues; red and green blasts collide, illuminating the area with a dazzling white and orange glow. Harry, undeterred, advances with renewed vigor, pushing Voldemort back as the energy from the Elder Wand dissipates and fades away completely. With a flick of his wrist, Harry sends the Elder Wand spinning through the air across the courtyard. As Voldemort begins to collapse forward, fragments of his skull detach, and in a moment of sheer horror, he looks up, his body and clothing disintegrating into countless tiny pieces that float upwards. Bathed in the morning sunlight filtering through the mountains, these remnants, reminiscent of ashes from a burning paper, drift harmlessly skyward.\n\nInside, the battle's toll is evident as exhausted students rest on the stairs. Neville, still gripping the Sword of Gryffindor, beams with pride as Luna shyly takes a seat beside him. Harry, wandering aimlessly through the Great Hall with a mug in hand, bears signs of the recent struggle with congealed blood under his right nostril and bottom lip. A smile graces his face as he spots the Weasley family reunited, and he continues past lively groups of chatting students. Cho Chang offers him a faint smile, while Aberforth engages in conversation with Dean and Seamus. Harry pauses in front of Hagrid, who envelops him in a warm, giant hug before examining him closely. With a grin, Harry watches Hagrid amble away. Meanwhile, Filch struggles futilely to sweep up a massive heap of rubble. As Hermione and Ron enter the Hall, Harry's smile returns upon noticing their entwined hands. Hermione looks down shyly.\n\nOutside, under the brilliant sunshine, the trio strolls leisurely along a bridge marred by battle, its balustrades broken. Harry steps onto a shattered stone support and surveys the scene, nodding to himself as he holds the Elder Wand in his right hand. He toys with it, scrutinizing it closely before positioning it horizontally in both hands. Hermione and Ron exchange a knowing glance. With a decisive motion, Harry snaps the wand in half and tosses the pieces into the chasm below the bridge. He nods once more, then turns to his friends, descending from the stone support. As he begins to walk away, Hermione and Ron watch him. Harry glances back at them, and Hermione confidently strides up to him, taking his hand with an admiring gaze. Ron joins them, standing beside Hermione, who then takes his hand as well. Together, with the backdrop of their ruined school, they stand united on the rubble-strewn bridge, looking forward.\n\nThe scene shifts dramatically to the St. Pancras Hotel, a majestic structure complete with a clock tower. Nearby, inside King's Cross Station, a young boy with dark hair, dressed in a striped shirt and no older than eleven, pushes a trolley laden with luggage and an animal cage along the platform, marking the beginning of a new adventure.",
    "1262": "The serene waters of Hogwarts' lake are cradled by the looming shadows of dark mountains. Across the lake, on a secluded isle, stands a tomb crafted from white marble. Suddenly, a large block of marble shifts backward, and the supports beneath it crumble, revealing the resting place. Dark Lord Voldemort leans into the tomb, his eyes fixed on the black Elder Wand clutched in his hand. With a swift motion, he raises his arm, unleashing a colossal surge of energy from the wand's tip that lights up the night sky.\n\nHovering ominously overhead, Dementors in tattered black robes encircle Hogwarts. Severus Snape, dressed in his customary black tunic and gown, observes from an upper archway. His gaze drifts over the misty mountains that shroud the horizon. Below, in regimented ranks, students march somberly across the courtyard, their subdued presence felt by Snape, who watches with a heavy heart.\n\nAt the foot of a grave, marked by an inscription, Harry Potter kneels, peering into a shattered piece of mirror. Within it, he sees not only his own reflection but also another face. This grave is nestled amidst sand dunes behind Shell Cottage, which faces a pristine white beach stretching towards the sea. Inside the cottage, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley sit in the lounge of the home belonging to Ron's brother, Bill, and his wife, Fleur.\n\nLuna Lovegood, with her usual nonchalance, approaches a set of hanging chimes. In the kitchen, Bill exchanges a glance with Fleur. Meanwhile, Luna pauses to admire the chimes. Harry enters assertively and confronts Bill.\n\nIn another room, Griphook, a goblin with pointed ears and a long beaky nose, is seated in an armchair, his hands clasped and eyes closed. Bill ushers Harry, Hermione, and Ron into the goblin's presence. Griphook, his hands still joined and his mouth firmly shut, stares ahead intensely. As Harry moves to look out the window, Griphook grips the arms of his chair, his long, filthy pointed nails prominent. He reclasps his hands, focusing his intense gaze on Harry.\n\nHarry's eyes wander to the Sword of Gryffindor, propped against the wall. Griphook leans back in his chair, takes a deep breath, and again clasps his hands. His gaze shifts momentarily to the sword, and he points directly at it. Harry's attention returns to the sword.\n\nDownstairs in the kitchen, as the trio emerges from Griphook's room and pauses on the landing, Fleur guides them into another room. There, by a window, sits the old wand maker, Ollivander, who looks up at Harry's entrance. Harry hands him a curved wand, which Ollivander inspects closely. Harry then passes him a plain, straight wand, which Ollivander brings to his left ear, turning it thoughtfully in his fingers. After a moment, Ollivander returns the wand to Harry, leans forward, then slightly back, his eyes widening as he solemnly fixes his gaze on Harry. As Harry rises to leave, the group exits.\n\nHermione, in the meantime, holds a long strand of curling, black hair.",
    "1273": "In the Room of Requirement, Hermione turns towards Aberforth, who acknowledges her with a nod. She then shifts her attention to Harry, and together, they fix their gaze on a painting. Hermione squints, examining it intently. They both step back a bit as a girl in the portrait resumes her position. Suddenly, the painting's frame swings open like a door, unveiling a tunnel entrance.\n\nInside the tunnel, Neville appears with his face bruised and battered. A painting framed in gold beside him opens, revealing a long, dark passage with a distant speck of light. Neville addresses the others and steps aside, revealing Harry. Harry observes a room full of students in hammocks, steps down, and is warmly embraced by them one after another. Neville approaches another student, who promptly rushes to a radio. Harry, feeling uneasy, faces the crowd of expectant students. Ginny Weasley bursts into the room, ignoring Ron, as everyone's attention shifts to Harry.\n\nAt Hogwarts, on the grand staircase, Death Eater Amycus Carrow closely watches lines of students marching across the courtyard and descending towards the great hall. Inside, staff and students are assembled. Severus Snape strides through the rows, taking his place at the front, flanked by Amycus Carrow and his sister, Alecto. He slowly turns to face the gathering, while students exchange glances as he moves among them. Some students, including Cho, Ginny, and Seamus, who have previously met Harry, stand subdued, eyes fixed on the floor. A student in a gown steps forward, confronting Snape directly.\n\nRon, Hermione, the Weasleys, Shacklebolt, and Remus enter the hall. Snape, reacting quickly, draws his wand. Professor McGonagall pushes Harry aside to face Snape. Others near the door also draw their wands. McGonagall launches an energy burst at Snape, who skillfully repels it, sending the deflected energy striking the Carrows. With a swift motion, Snape envelops himself in his black cloak and ascends through a high window, flying away.\n\nAfter Snape's departure, Harry discards his gown. Torches ignite, illuminating the hall as students burst into celebration. Harry, suddenly overwhelmed, sits down, and McGonagall approaches him. The room darkens, and Harry, looking ashen and tense, catches the apprehensive glances of the students around him. The sky outside darkens with ominous clouds, increasing McGonagall's anxiety.\n\nScreams pierce the air as two girls cry out. The gloom lifts, and the torches in the great hall flare up brightly again. The students retreat from Harry, but Ginny moves protectively in front of him. Hermione and more students step forward in solidarity. Filch, the caretaker, rushes into the scene. Harry approaches McGonagall and, on his way out, pauses before leading everyone out of the hall.\n\nAmidst the evacuation, the characters in the portraits abandon their frames and scuttle away. Students rush down the stairs, while Harry fights his way up through them. He hands the Marauder's Map to Ron and sets off once more.",
    "1274": "Hermione and Ron descend the stairs, while Luna trails after Harry. In the courtyard, Luna confronts the school as massive stone statues of warriors, armed with enormous weapons, crash down onto the paved terrace near the main entrance. These stone warriors then march down the steps into the courtyard.\n\nProfessor Flitwick confidently strides across the cobbled courtyard, raising his wand skyward. Following his lead, Professor Slughorn and Molly Weasley also aim their wands upwards. Students, gathered around them, gaze intently into the sky. Brilliant flashes of light burst from the wands, causing the clouds to merge seamlessly.\n\nSuddenly, a Dementor sweeps past but is forcefully repelled by an expanding mass that envelops the school and its grounds, creating a formidable protective shield. Inside, against a stream of descending students, Harry ascends a spiral staircase. Luna quickly catches up to him. Harry halts, pivoting around, and notices something beyond a window. Approaching it, he observes the radiant protective shields gradually enveloping the area. Together, they stand and watch the shield's descent.\n\nOutside, Flitwick observes the shield as it rises. Luna and Harry, illuminated by flanking torches, stand framed by their light. Harry's shadow is projected against a wall as he proceeds down a dimly lit corridor, the sole illumination provided by a tall window to his right. He approaches a stone doorway and catches sight of a ghostly woman with dark hair, clad in a gray dress, hovering by a window. She turns to face him, then morphs into a ball of light and passes through him. She pauses, her expression somber and anxious.\n\nOutside, the night is nearly pitch black, with the distant lights of Hogwarts casting a faint glow. An army of Death Eaters is assembled on a rocky outcrop, overlooking the school. They make way for Voldemort and Bellatrix, who stride through their ranks to the cliff's edge. Voldemort turns to glare menacingly at Pius Thicknesse, who recoils in fear. The Death Eaters then raise their wands and unleash a barrage of light bolts that descend like shooting stars upon the protective shield.\n\nInside, Harry looks over at the ghostly figure of Helena. She drifts away, prompting Harry to sprint along a walkway and leap onto a low wall. After confronting Harry, Helena recedes, floating away from him along the walkway. Harry pursues her. She pauses, her back to him, then turns stiffly to face him, her gaze fixed on his weary face. She moves closer, then floats away once more, transforming into a ball of light and speeding away. Harry races down the spiral staircase.\n\nElsewhere, Kingsley Shacklebolt stands with Remus Lupin and student Dean Thomas, watching as the Death Eaters' bolts strike their targets. The Weasley twins, George and Fred, also look upward at the sky. Meanwhile, Hermione stands behind Ron at a door adorned with six large metal snakes.",
    "1275": "As the Chamber of Secrets' heavy, circular stone door swings open, triggered by the movement of the snake locks, the protective shield at the Quidditch Pitch lights up the dark hillside with burning wooden ground stones. Illusions relentlessly pound against this shield, creating a vivid spectacle. Meanwhile, Neville, standing on a covered wooden bridge, surveys the landscape and spots an army of Snatchers, led by Scabior, charging towards the school. Two Snatchers dash ahead, collide with the shield, and disintegrate, causing Neville to recoil in shock. Scabior, regaining composure, steadies his men and fixes his gaze on Neville, who is guarding the entrance ahead.\n\nElsewhere, in the Chamber of Secrets, Ron approaches the Basilisk's skeleton and forcefully extracts a fang from its jaw. Hermione retrieves a two-handled gold cup from her bottomless bag. Ron passes her the fang, and then kneels to place the cup on the ground between them. Hermione, also kneeling, hesitates as she stares at the cup. Nearby, Harry navigates his way through a crowd of students. Ron looks up at Hermione, who then pulls back her arm and decisively stabs the fang into the cup. The action elicits a roar from Voldemort, and the cup skids across the floor. Harry, gasping, stumbles back as water suddenly floods into the chamber, prompting Hermione and Ron to flee. Amidst the swelling torrent, Voldemort appears, taking deep breaths. Gasping, Harry leans against a pillar for support. As the waters recede, Ron and Hermione turn to each other and share a passionate kiss, seemingly standing on a bridge with water flanking them on both sides, before they break apart.\n\nOn an outcrop, Voldemort, with Nagini coiled beside him, wields the Elder Wand to unleash a powerful blast of light at the shield, causing parts of it to burn. Professor McGonagall and Ginny look up, witnessing the shield transforming into a burning dome of flame. Nearby, Remus reaches out to Nymphadora, their fingers almost touching. Voldemort, still holding the Elder Wand, recoils suddenly as energy crackles through it. He looks down at the wand and then up at the smoldering shield.\n\nRegaining his strength, Harry moves determinedly through the fleeing students. The shield, now disintegrating, scatters burning debris across the sky. Scabior catches a flaming ember on the tip of his wand and, scowling at Neville who remains on guard, takes a slow, tentative step forward with a grin. Neville backs away as the Snatchers surge forward behind Scabior, aiming for the bridge. They hurl fireballs at Neville, who skillfully dodges them. Neville then casts a spell that ignites charges in the bridge's supports, causing them to explode. Scabior quickens his pace as the bridge collapses behind him. Ginny and others watch as Neville sprints toward them, just before a massive explosion tears the bridge apart.",
    "1276": "As they stood at the edge of a precipice, horror filled their eyes at the sight of the deep chasm before them. In a swift motion, a wand was tossed into the air by a hand, followed by the appearance of a second hand. Neville, determined, pulled himself up, revealing his head as he emerged.\n\nFrom the opposite direction, an army comprising Dementors, Death Eaters, and Giants advanced menacingly towards the school. Amidst this chaos, Professor Flitwick retreated between the ranks of the Stone Army, only to be confronted by an approaching Giant. Vines swiftly ensnared the Giant, pinning him firmly to the ground. Death Eaters descended, launching green light blasts at the Stone Warriors. Two daring Giants wielded pronged weapons, sending people flying as they barreled through the Stone Army in pursuit of the diminutive Professor Flitwick.\n\nAn explosion tore through the courtyard, prompting people to scatter and seek shelter. Flames began to engulf sections of the school. Death Eaters forcefully entered a tower, where Arthur Weasley valiantly repelled one attacker, while Kingsley Shacklebolt momentarily suspended another in the air before hurling him out the window. Hurrying down the stairs, Harry turned to confront a third Death Eater, propelling him away before continuing his descent. Neville dashed off in haste.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Ginny and Harry shared a fleeting kiss before Ginny hurriedly ascended the stairs. Draco, seizing control, grabbed Blaise and Goyle, forcing them to follow him.\n\nHarry sprinted down a corridor where the ceiling was collapsing. Dodging falling debris, he abruptly halted upon encountering a black stone wall—the entrance to the Room of Requirement. Focusing intently, the wall transformed. Meanwhile, Ron pored over the Marauder's Map, eventually looking up with a wide-eyed expression of shock.\n\nDraco, spotting the entrance to the Room of Requirement, turned to Blaise and Goyle. As they charged toward the door, it vanished, leaving only a blank wall in its place.\n\nInside the Room of Requirement, Harry found himself in a vast storeroom packed with towering stacks of furniture and assorted items. He navigated deeper into the room, weaving between the cluttered aisles. His search was relentless, passing by books, statues, and ornaments made of gold and silver. A winged blue Pixie perched high on a golden picture frame watched him curiously before fluttering closer to get a better look.\n\nHarry paused, listening intently, then turned and retraced his steps slowly and deliberately toward a table covered in a jumble of bric-a-brac. As he moved aside a coil of silk rope, his attention was drawn to a plain wooden casket. Carefully, he pulled it forward, unfastened it, and lifted the lid to reveal the diadem—a silver tiara fashioned in the likeness of a raven, centered with a large blue stone and adorned with a pendant stone shaped like a tear.\n\nIn another part of the room, Blaise caught Goyle's eye, and their spells clashed violently, sending the diadem soaring into the air.",
    "1279": "As panic spreads among others, a mysterious cloud flows into the operations room. Nearby, a large assembly of men in vehicles gathers, while immense pressure strains the massive steel doors of a facility until they burst open, sending one door soaring through the air. In response, soldiers unleash a barrage of firepower at the encroaching cloud, yet it relentlessly ascends the hillside towards them, prompting the men to flee as it reaches them. Amidst the chaos, the Defense Secretary shares a resigned glance with an officer before lowering her gaze.\n\nMeanwhile, a truck rumbles along a desert highway towards an industrial complex's smoking chimneys. The driver, puzzled, adjusts the radio and activates the windscreen wipers. Suddenly, the cloud envelops the truck, reducing it to dust from the back forward, then consumes a nearby road sign completely.\n\nElsewhere, Helen sits alone in a sparsely furnished room, her head bowed. She looks affectionately at Mike before gathering her belongings, including her phone, and checking her watch. In a different setting, Jacob and Klaatu discover an old ranger hut in the woods near a high bridge. They force the door open, and inside, Jacob attempts to use the phone. Klaatu, with a detached demeanor, unplugs the receiver, briefly touches the cord, reconnects it, and hands the phone back to Jacob, who reaches up to dial on the wall-mounted phone as Klaatu surveys the room.\n\nLater, Jacob and Klaatu ride in the open back of a pickup truck along a forest road. Jacob looks earnestly at the emotionless Klaatu, who in turn observes Jacob thoughtfully. Their journey leads them to an iron gate adorned with ornate spikes. Jacob scales a low wall topped with iron railings, followed by Klaatu, as they enter a cemetery filled with rows of white headstones. Klaatu examines the inscriptions while Jacob clears leaves from a grave and cleans the headstone with his glove. With a pleading look, Jacob seeks Klaatu's attention, but Klaatu, after a moment of study, walks away, leaving Jacob to kneel dejectedly at his father's grave, tears streaming down his face. Helen rushes to comfort him, embracing him tightly as they hold each other close. Klaatu watches this scene intently, his expression unchanging as he approaches them through the rustling leaves.\n\nThe arrival of Mike in his SUV shifts the atmosphere as Helen, her eyes filled with tears, looks at him imploringly. Behind Klaatu, the sky darkens as the swarm approaches, obliterating a sports stadium that crumbles to dust in its path. The now vast, swirling gray mass continues its advance towards New York. The Secretary of Defense, moved by the unfolding events, raises a hand to her mouth, struggling to contain her emotions.",
    "1280": "The movie opens with a visual of a mass spreading across the Eastern seaboard of the United States. New York City appears utterly abandoned, with the once bustling lights and advertisements of Times Square now witnessing no human presence. Mike navigates his SUV through the desolate streets, with Klaatu seated beside him and Helen and Jacob in the back, exchanging anxious glances.\n\nWith a determined look, Mike accelerates towards a military roadblock. Soldiers scatter as the vehicle speeds past, quickly followed by military Humvees equipped with machine guns. Inside the SUV, tension is palpable; Mike's face is tense, Helen peers nervously out the rear window, while Klaatu remains eerily calm. Their pursuers eventually fall back.\n\nThe group veers into Central Park, driving across the grassy expanse towards a mysterious sphere. Suddenly, an explosion sends their car tumbling, eventually stopping against a tree. Overhead, fighter jets zoom by as a massive fireball engulfs the sphere. From a remote location, Regina observes the attack on a monitor, closing her eyes in momentary relief. As the smoke dissipates, it becomes clear that the sphere remains unscathed.\n\nMeanwhile, the swarm reaches the outskirts of Manhattan. In the wreckage of the car, Mike is found dead. Helen, in a panic, unbuckles her seatbelt and notices the windscreen being consumed by a mysterious force. Klaatu manages to extricate himself and gently pulls Jacob from the wreckage. Emerging from the car, Helen looks up to see the swarm encircling the sphere. More gray clouds of insects arrive, darkening the sky above.\n\nKlaatu, taking Jacob by the hand, leads them in a sprint across the grass towards a tunnel just before a hedge. The swarm remains outside as they enter. Inside, Klaatu, deep in thought, notices Jacob's nose bleeding. As Helen stoops to check on her son, he collapses into her arms. She touches her own nose, finding blood on her finger, and looks pleadingly at Klaatu.\n\nTaking Jacob's hand from Helen, Klaatu closes his eyes in concentration. Bugs begin to crawl up his wrist, emerging from Helen and Jacob's skin and burrowing into Klaatu in a gruesome spectacle. Jacob regains consciousness. Klaatu opens his eyes, looking at Helen and Jacob with a serene expression as Helen stares back at him, wide-eyed.\n\nKlaatu then walks towards the tunnel's exit. He pauses to look back at Helen comforting Jacob, meeting her gaze before stepping out into the raging swarm. He advances slowly through the swirling gray mass, raising a hand futilely to shield his face and head. His suit begins to disintegrate, revealing bloody patches on his hands and face.\n\nAs Klaatu nears the sphere, he collapses to his knees. With a monumental effort, he rises, extends his arm, and touches the sphere. A brilliant light erupts as he is absorbed into it. The sphere then releases a powerful pulse of energy, causing the swarms of millions of bugs to plummet to the ground like rain.",
    "1282": "In the park, a sudden explosion sends leaves flying and knocks bystanders off their feet. Amidst the chaos, a child's buggy is swept away by the fierce winds, and a park bench is torn from its mountings. As the dust settles, an Apache attack helicopter flies into the swirling cloud overhead.\n\nA scientist's helicopter lands in the park, and soldiers emerge, their weapons ready and torches blazing. Following closely, scientists in hazmat suits with glass-fronted helmets move cautiously through the trees towards a glowing, vapor-shrouded object. As they advance, the torches on their rifles pierce the dense gloom, revealing an eerie green glow emanating from the object. Among them, Helen moves forward with determination, focusing intensely as swirling lights cut through the dissipating mists.\n\nCrowds gather, staring up at a pulsating sphere towering hundreds of feet above them. Helen, visibly shocked, gazes at the sphere through her visor, her mouth agape. Suddenly, an intense beam of white light sweeps across the ground. Alarmed, Helen looks around as military Hummers, equipped with heavy machine guns, arrive on the scene alongside a convoy of police vehicles. Soldiers quickly take up firing positions, and one aims a .50 caliber machine gun directly at the sphere. Floodlights illuminate the site as police snipers position themselves around the park.\n\nThe Apache helicopter circles the sphere as beams of light burst from its interior and focus intensely at its base. The overwhelming power forces Helen to shield her eyes with her arm. Tension mounts as police and soldiers stand ready with weapons raised. Amidst the white blaze of light, a figure appears, prompting Helen to move towards it cautiously. Despite the soldiers preparing to fire, Helen continues her slow approach towards the figure near the base of the sphere. She hesitates for a moment before the figure extends a human-like hand. As Helen reaches out to take it, red blood suddenly sprays across her visor, and the figure collapses into her arms. Looking down, she sees a humanoid shape with a featureless face as personnel rush to assist.\n\nWithin the sphere, more lights blaze, drawing everyone's gaze upwards. From the sphere emerges a colossal 50-foot humanoid robot, its single eye slit emitting a piercing light. Instantly, all weapons malfunction, and all lights go out. People writhe in pain on the ground, overwhelmed by the noise emanating from the robot. It strides towards Helen, still cradling the wounded visitor, and looms over her. The robot lowers its head towards her, extending a massive hand before withdrawing it. It then raises its head, standing still with its arms by its sides as the light in its eye slit extinguishes. Abruptly, all lights, power, and weapon systems are restored, leaving the scene in stunned silence.",
    "1284": "Helen and her escort pass by two agents maneuvering an empty wheelchair toward Klaatu's room. As they proceed, the lift doors open to reveal Klaatu, manacled and seated in a wheelchair, surrounded by four agents. They push him down a corridor lined with pipes, eventually into a spacious room where a bespectacled man sits at a table laden with electronic equipment. Klaatu is wheeled to the table, where electrodes are meticulously attached to his temples and across his body. The operator then activates the polygraph machine.\n\nAfter the setup, the agents exit the room and join others stationed at intervals along the corridor's walls, standing guard. Inside, the man at the table focuses intently on his equipment, while the polygraph operator, glasses perched on his nose, scrutinizes the flickering electronic traces on his screen. Klaatu, maintaining a steady gaze, turns to watch the man. The screen begins to blur and distort, with needles tracing wave patterns on the scrolling graph paper. The operator's intense stare turns to a frown as he adjusts his console, only to be jolted backward by an electric charge. He ends up half-lying under the table, twitching, before slowly pulling himself upright, staring blankly into space.\n\nKlaatu's focus shifts through the electrode cables connected to a security camera, observing an agent on guard. He then shifts his attention through another camera to another guard. Meanwhile, two more agents in suits walk down the corridor. Klaatu closes his eyes, and immediately, the agents clutch their earpieces and collapse in agony.\n\nAs the lights flicker and power fluctuates throughout the building, Klaatu, now in a suit, looks up from his seat. Helen, alarmed, quickly dons her coat and grabs a sample of Klaatu's fatty outer skin. Klaatu, now standing, removes the electrodes from the now catatonic and underwear-clad polygraph operator, who slumps onto the table. Klaatu strides past the agents still writhing in pain along the corridor.\n\nHelen, wary and glancing around, runs down a shadowy corridor affected by the flickering lights. Klaatu enters the lift and soon walks along a railway line in an industrial area, with flames erupting from a refinery stack in the background. He arrives at a railway station platform and, in slow motion, walks beside a train before entering the bustling station concourse. Calmly navigating through the crowded station, he checks the departures board, noting that all trains are delayed. Amid the chaos, a bearded man jostles through the crowd, deftly snatching a ticket from another man's pocket as he brushes past.",
    "1286": "In the opening scene, the occupants of a car remain seated as the windscreen wipers and headlights continue to operate. A man then exits the vehicle and approaches a taxi from which an elderly Chinese man, escorted by a young man with an umbrella, emerges. Inside a nearby restaurant, the young man serves a cup to the old man. Seated opposite each other are the old man and Klaatu, while at a different table, Helen and her grandson are present. Helen's gaze fixates on Klaatu, and she briefly looks at the men before lowering her eyes. Klaatu, in turn, watches the old man with an expressionless face.\n\nElsewhere, high metal panels are erected, forming a triangular enclosure around a robot, and a lid is secured on top. The Colonel, observing this, displays a nervous grin. As night falls, police cars race down a street. Helen drives towards Highlands, New Jersey, and stops in a wooded area where Klaatu exits the car. Jacob, visibly puzzled, watches through the window as Helen follows Klaatu into the darkness.\n\nNavigating through the pitch-black environment, Helen moves cautiously. Overwhelmed, she cowers and shields her head as insects swarm around her. Reaching a pond, she witnesses the water start to bubble and emit light from beneath. Concealed behind a tree, she observes a 10-foot-high sphere emerge from the pond, its interior filled with swirling lights and dark mists, attracting fish and other animals. A frog and a lizard jump into the water, heading towards the sphere, which then drifts to the pond's edge. Klaatu approaches, and upon touching the sphere, a flare of light spreads beneath his hand and ripples across its surface.\n\nMeanwhile, in Central Park, helicopters circle another sphere, and in a desert, a similar sphere attracts scorpions and snakes with a burst of light across its surface. In a jungle, yet another sphere experiences a similar phenomenon. On a calm sea, a fishing boat floats near a vast sphere akin to the one in New York as it breaks the surface.\n\nBack at the pond, Klaatu intensely focuses on the sphere with his hand on its surface, observed by Helen from a distance. She then returns to the car, takes the driver's seat, and sits in a stunned state, staring straight ahead.\n\nVideo footage captures people gathering around a sphere in South America, and another screen shows a sphere being blasted with a flamethrower, revealing creatures squirming inside through the now-transparent surface. Helen and Jacob, waiting in the car within the woods, eventually exit. Helen follows the boy into the darkness, and they are soon enveloped in a brilliant light. Together, they watch in awe as the sphere from the pond, now radiating with intense white light, ascends slowly into the air.",
    "1288": "At dawn, the sky radiates a soft glow while three helicopters approach, their lights piercing through the morning haze. Startled, Helen dashes indoors. She quickly plants a kiss on someone's cheek before hurrying away. Amidst a downpour, Helen, Klaatu, and Jacob flee their house, sprinting towards their car. They soon abandon the vehicle, plunging into the thick woods nearby. Klaatu takes the lead, with Helen struggling to match his pace while clutching Jacob's hand. They dash through the forest at top speed as the helicopters roar ominously overhead.\n\nSuddenly, Jacob slips from Helen's grip. A soldier descends on a rope and swiftly seizes Helen. Above, the remaining two helicopters hover menacingly as Klaatu walks past the stunned Jacob into a clearing. He directs targeting lasers towards the palms of his hands. As the helicopters fire, Klaatu reverses the energy flow. The pilots, gripped by agony, clutch their helmets while losing control of their aircraft. The choppers collide mid-air, crashing to the ground in a fiery explosion.\n\nJacob, turning away from the chaos, races back into the woods. Klaatu follows him at a leisurely pace. The boy reaches a narrow, wooden bridge over a river. Trembling with fear, he steps onto the slippery planks. As he retreats from the approaching alien, a loose board snaps beneath him. Klaatu reaches out just in time, preventing Jacob from falling. With a frown, Klaatu examines the boy, who looks up at him with a glimmer of hope. They lock eyes in a tense moment before Klaatu strides away. Jacob hesitates briefly before following.\n\nMeanwhile, inside a chamber, an operative in a protective suit works to repair the drill mechanism near GORT. The agent and operations room staff observe through the window. The chipped drill bit is swapped out for a new one. However, within the tiny fissures of the old bit, minuscule black bugs flutter and multiply rapidly. Klaatu casts a brief glance towards the scene.\n\nAs the operative secures the new drill bit, he notices the old one being devoured by the bugs. Alarmed, he drops it and rushes to exit the chamber. The bugs swiftly corrode his suit, air canister, and then his body. The steel bands restraining GORT suffer the same fate. The agent watches in horror as the window glass starts to disintegrate under the bugs' attack. A massive jet of flame erupts within the chamber, causing the operations room staff to squint against the intense brightness. As the flames and smoke dissipate, GORT stands unscathed, his eyes still aglow.\n\nThe agent's fear escalates as GORT raises his massive hands, signifying his liberation. GORT then transforms into a cloud of bugs that engulfs the flash chamber. The agent frantically attempts to escape, but his pass fails to open the door. The officer in charge watches with a grim expression as the swirling cloud of bugs assaults the windows.",
    "1291": "The Previa slowly enters the upscale, gated community where Mark and Vanessa Loring reside in their large, though somewhat generic McMansion, surrounded by nothing but bare soil in the yard. Mac parks the vehicle at the curb, and both he and Juno appear visibly uneasy as they await a greeting. Vanessa, a meticulous and attractive woman in her early thirties, opens the door and hesitantly ushers them inside. Upon entering, Juno removes her hooded sweatshirt and hands it to Vanessa, who places it on a nearby bench.\n\nMark Loring, a boyishly handsome man in his mid-thirties, joins Vanessa, his expression turning sheepish upon hearing a mention of the Penny Saver before he extends a handshake to Mac and Juno. Mac enthusiastically shakes Mark's hand. They are then led into the stark, expansive living room where a woman in a business suit sits with a briefcase on her lap. Vanessa displays clear excitement, while Mark and Juno exchange a meaningful glance. Juno brings her wrist close to Mark's twitching nose, and he inhales deeply.\n\nJuno's attention is drawn to a partially open door revealing guitars mounted on the wall and the edges of posters inside. Meanwhile, Vanessa, Mac, and Gerta Rauss wait in awkward silence for Juno and Mark to return. Mac's eyes catch a new Pilates machine, still in its packaging, tucked away in a corner of the room. Vanessa and Gerta remain unresponsive, with Vanessa glancing upward.\n\nMark and Juno spend time playing unplugged guitars, strumming small riffs, while Mark appears embarrassed by Vanessa's overly enthusiastic behavior. As the visit concludes, Juno and Mac don their coats and begin to leave, with Vanessa and Mark following them out. Mac gives Juno a grave look, and Juno turns to glance at Mark one last time before they depart. Mark closes the door behind them.\n\nThe scene shifts to a track team jogging in formation, their feet leaving imprints in the snow. Bleeker runs alone on the track until his friend Vijay, a solemn and slender boy similar to Bleeker, joins him. After a brief comment about the relentless running, Vijay jogs off, leaving Bleeker to stop and wipe away his sweat.\n\nThe camera then focuses on Juno's now five-month pregnant belly as she stands before a school administrator who hands her a slip. Juno takes it with a smile and leaves the office, accidentally bumping into Bleeker on her way out. At an ultrasound appointment, the baby's head is visible on the monitor, prompting an immediate defensive reaction from Juno, Leah, and Bren. Bren points to the ultrasound monitor as the ultrasound technician exits in frustration. Later, Juno lies in bed, examining the ultrasound printout.\n\nThe Previa returns to Mark and Vanessa's exclusive gated community, and Juno, visibly uncomfortable in the cold, rings the doorbell. Mark, casually dressed in a t-shirt and jeans, opens the door to greet her.",
    "1299": "Graham's smile fades as he and his companion turn their attention back to the silent television screen. Merrill's mouth slightly opens in surprise. Graham, too, redirects his gaze to the TV, his eyes widening in response to what he sees. As daylight floods the family room, Graham finds himself alone on the couch, and subsequently alone in the room. He scans the area, noticing the absence of the television. Rising to his feet, he surveys the room until his eyes fix on an extension cord stretching from a wall outlet in the family room, across the front hall, and under a closet door. Moving towards the door, Graham opens the closet to reveal Merrill seated on a kitchen chair, the television cramped beside him on a roll-away stand. Graham's gaze shifts to the TV screen, displaying a daylight shot of Mexico City with empty skies above. Merrill points to the sky on the screen, his finger tracing down to the bottom.\n\nEmerging from the bathroom with wet hair, Graham dries it while approaching his bedroom window. Outside, a large green backyard hosts a wooden jungle gym and a single tree casting shade over a picnic table. The yard's rear is bordered by golden and brown corn crops, standing six feet high and extending beyond view. Graham watches the crops quietly, listening intently. He then proceeds down the hall to check on his children, Morgan and Bo, who are perched on the edge of their bed, wearing tin foil helmets. Graham, entering the room, is met by his children making room for him on the bed. He sits between them as Morgan places a book on his lap. Graham examines the back cover for a picture before Morgan closes the book. Graham looks at his children, still adorned with foil, as Morgan repositions the book and opens it. Graham acknowledges with a nod that he had a tone, turning the page to reveal an illustration of a small, bulbous-headed figure shaking hands with a bearded human. Morgan flips the page to show a spaceship hovering over a home, firing laser beams at it. Another page reveals a picture of a house. Their attention then shifts to the front yard, where three bodies lie dead on the lawn, two of them children. The children scream and cling to their father until their cries subside. Graham closes the book as the phone rings again. He stands, walks into the hallway, tucks the book under his arm, and answers the phone. Through the receiver, sudden scuffling and a chair squealing against the floor are heard before the call abruptly disconnects.",
    "1300": "Graham descends the stairs, wearing his overcoat. He approaches the closet door, knocks on it, and then opens it. He begins to walk down the hall. For the first time, Merrill emerges from the closet. In his room, Morgan reluctantly pulls his eye away from the telescope positioned on the window seat. Bo envelops Morgan in a tight hug, which Morgan gently breaks. Graham unlocks the front door and, struck with shock, gazes down the hall, his reaction delayed as he continues to stare blankly.\n\nIn a truck, Ray grips the steering wheel so tightly that his knuckles turn a pale yellow-white. Two large bags, stuffed with clothes, are visible. Graham glances towards the backseat of the truck and then shifts his gaze back to Ray, noticing two blood-stained spots on Ray's shirt. Tears begin to stream down Graham's face. Ray, his face flushed and quivering, finally turns to look at Graham. The two men lock eyes for a moment before Ray averts his gaze and shifts the car into drive. Graham steps back as the truck advances and departs down the driveway.\n\nInside the closet, Merrill's head rests against a pile of winter coats, his eyes closed. He awakens, sits up, and leans forward in his chair, which creaks as he moves closer to the television screen. Graham, meanwhile, waits for a response but receives none. He bends down to examine the space under the pantry door, but at a severe angle, he can only see the bottoms of a few shelves. Frustrated and unsure, he notices a scatter of kitchen knives on the floor. He selects a butcher knife and approaches the door, using the knife as a mirror to peek underneath. He observes a soft reflection but pulls the knife back, still kneeling just two feet from the door. After taking a deep breath, Graham attempts to lower his head under the slanted kitchen table but stops halfway, losing his nerve. He rises, places the butcher knife on the counter, and walks across the kitchen to the door. He hesitates for a long time before finally releasing the doorknob. With urgency, he retrieves the butcher knife, kneels by the pantry, ducks his head under the table again, and presses his cheek to the floor, peering intently into the pantry, only inches away from the door.",
    "1302": "In the hallway, Graham gently places Bo down. She remains close to him as the four of them huddle together in a tight group, standing quietly. Morgan, overwhelmed by emotion, gazes at his father, unable to utter a word. Simultaneously, all four of them tilt their heads upward. Merrill, part of this group, shifts his gaze up the stairs to the boarded bedroom doors.\n\nGraham tenderly takes Morgan's hand, and a warm smile graces his face as he looks down at his son, who reciprocates with a gentle smile. The quartet then turns their attention to the top of the stairs, watching intently. Merrill's eyes trace a path above the bedroom doors, fixating on a rectangle in the ceiling from which a small rope dangles.\n\nTension escalates as Morgan and Bo stand frozen, their eyes locked on a set of long fingers that creep under the front door. Remarkably, the fingers' color shifts to match the exact yellow, cracked paint of the door. Responding to the alarming sight, Graham and Merrill make their way to the front hall. Graham swiftly takes Morgan and Bo by their hands, leading them down the hall with urgency, while Merrill backs away, keeping his eyes on the top of the stairs.\n\nGraham descends the last few steps into the basement and closes the door behind him, noting with concern that the door lacks a lock. The basement is crowded with metal shelves cluttered with an assortment of canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, and outdoor tools. Amidst this chaos, Merrill frantically rummages through the shelves. Graham presses his ear against the door, listening intently. Meanwhile, Merrill moves to another set of shelves and starts knocking items to the ground in his search.\n\nThe tension peaks as scratching sounds come from the other side of the door, followed by the doorknob turning. Graham quickly seizes the knob with both hands, struggling to keep the door closed as it begins to push open. In the dim light of a single bulb hanging from the ceiling, Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging, its three-foot wooden handle gripped firmly in his hand. He raises it in the air and then rushes towards Graham, inadvertently clipping the light bulb with the end of the handle, plunging the room into darkness.\n\nIn the ensuing darkness, Merrill turns the channel knob of a device, checking all stations, and listens to the faint hum emanating from the speakers. Graham steps into a beam of lights, looks at the door, and then turns to face the lights. His eyes then search for Merrill in the dark corner. Morgan directs his beam of light onto Merrill, then sets his flashlight on the ground and rolls it across the floor until it stops in Graham's waiting palm. Graham picks it up as Merrill, catching his breath, reaches for the remaining flashlight and trains its beam around the room.\n\nAs the situation grows dire, Merrill notices his nephew turning gray. In response, Graham pulls Morgan closer to him, whispering words of comfort into the child's ear, amidst the heightened tension and fear enveloping them.",
    "1303": "Morgan struggles as his throat constricts, his face contorted in panic and strain. Merrill gazes at his brother's anguished expression. Graham, closing his eyes, speaks into the enveloping darkness. Tears well up in Merrill's eyes as Graham's eyelids shut once more. Soon after, Graham opens his eyes and leans closely to Morgan's ear, whispering before closing his eyes again. Overwhelmed, he begins to cry, speaking to an unseen presence, and nods without turning his gaze.\n\nAbove them, a beam of light points at the basement ceiling. Graham observes the determination etched on his younger brother's face. His attention then shifts to Morgan, lying still on the floor. Turning to Merrill, the two men stand beneath a solitary light bulb. Graham quietly shifts his focus back to Morgan and moves towards him. Merrill watches as Graham kneels beside Morgan and unclips a baby monitor from his son's belt. Graham returns to Merrill, locking eyes with him as he extends the device between them and switches it on, filling the room with electrical static.\n\nThe basement door creaks open slightly, prompting Merrill to fully open it and ascend the stairs alone. Upon reaching the top, he surveys the surroundings before turning back to give a reassuring thumbs-up to those below. Carrying the limp form of Morgan in his arms, Merrill begins to sift through the scattered contents of fallen cabinets. Meanwhile, Graham gently places Morgan on the sofa. Bo emerges from a closet and peers into the family room, catching Graham's fleeting glance downward before he quickly looks up and tenderly touches her cheek. Overcome with emotion, she starts to cry as Colleen presses her cheek against Graham's hand, resting there with distant eyes.\n\nGraham's gaze drifts away from Merrill, who follows his line of sight to a baseball bat mounted overhead. Merrill reaches up, removes the bat from its spot, and advances as the creature begins to stir. Gripping the bat tightly, Merrill strides forward but pauses, shifting his weight to his right leg. Morgan's face, obscured by gas, remains visible as the creature twists, its disjointed appearance becoming more pronounced in the room's light. Merrill lunges, swinging his left leg forward, and delivers a powerful strike to the creature's back with the bat. Morgan is released, falling to the carpet in a crumpled heap, his limbs flopping lifelessly.\n\nAs the creature turns to confront Merrill, it is met with the rapid blur of the bat as Merrill swings with the force of a lumberjack. With a resounding slam, the creature collapses to the ground. Graham, lifting his son's limp body into his arms, watches as the creature struggles to regain its footing.",
    "1305": "The side door silently opens, revealing the narrow laundry room where David Dunne, cloaked in a hood, enters. A large mound of unopened mail, accumulated over two to three days, rests atop the clothes dryer. David's gaze, hidden beneath his hood, surveys the disarrayed room with open cabinets. The eeriest element in the room is the breakfast table, frozen in time with a plate of now moldy, half-eaten eggs at one setting and two bowls of vibrant cereal at another.\n\nDavid cautiously approaches a slightly ajar door in the kitchen, shielding his face from the pungent smell as he gently pulls it open, revealing the basement. At the base of the stairs lies a man's body, partially shrouded in shadow, partially illuminated. The man, recognizable from a flashback as the one who answered the door, has a crumpled tie draped over his motionless chest. David, with slow and tense movements, enters the empty room, his attention drawn upwards by sounds moving overhead.\n\nAs he ascends the stairs, the noise of someone being knocked out resonates above. On the landing, three closed doors beckon; David chooses the nearest one. It opens to reveal a young girl's room, cluttered with clothes and adorned with boy band posters, yet devoid of life. In the adjacent bathroom, a slightly overweight fourteen-year-old girl is bound by her wrists to a metal towel rack with a phone cord, her arms stretched upwards and knees drawn to her chest. Beside her, a skinny twelve-year-old boy is tied in a similar manner, their heads leaning back against their arms, their eyes half-closed in listlessness.\n\nAs the bathroom door opens, the hooded figure of David Dunne, his rain poncho still dripping, steps inside. After a brief pause in the doorway, he approaches the children. Their arms flop to their laps as they look up at the figure looming over them, the boy managing a slow blink.\n\nDavid steps back, observing them intently from under his hood. His attention shifts to a drawing he's been studying. Turning, he locks eyes with a striking and beautiful African American woman in her sixties standing beside him, who then meets his gaze for the first time. Across the store, David and the woman watch Elijah engaging with customers. They continue to observe as Elijah's mother crosses the store, waiting for him to conclude his conversation. David's focus returns to the framed sketch.",
    "1304": "Mathison sets his shopping bags aside and approaches a woman, kneeling before her and reaching for the bundle of sweatshirts she holds. A smile graces her face for the first time as she hands him the swaddled child. The doctor gently places the baby on his lap, unwrapping him with careful hands. As the baby is examined, the woman's view of her child is obstructed. She watches Dr. Mathison intently as he scrutinizes her baby, his face filled with concern when he finally looks up, meeting her gaze briefly. A shiver runs through her as she notices his shaken demeanor. Mathison then turns his attention to the three saleswomen present, his stern look unsettling them. The older saleswoman breaks the silence, causing the room to freeze in tension. The mother appears almost breathless with anticipation. Suddenly, the baby's scream pierces the air. The doctor murmurs something inaudible to himself before looking back at the saleswoman who had brought him in. Turning again to the mother, Mathison watches as she examines the magazine offered to her, then points to a Sports Illustrated magazine protruding from a seat pocket. David retrieves it and hands it over, waiting until the opposing train has passed before she returns her focus to the magazine.\n\nKelly, absorbed in her Sports Illustrated, lifts her gaze to meet David's. Her vivid blue eyes captivate him, but she then raises her hand, tapping the diamond ring on her finger, leading to an uncomfortable silence. Rising, Kelly steadies herself against a headrest as the train vibrates, making her way to the back of the car. Left alone, David feels engulfed by despair, sensing a gaze upon him. He looks up to see a little girl peering at him from between seats. To avoid her stare, David shifts towards the window, discreetly slipping his wedding band back onto his finger from his coat. The rhythmic motion of the train starts to close his eyes, though the shaking glass prevents them from shutting completely. Stirring as the vibrations intensify, David glances out the window to see the scenery rushing by in a blur. He notices other passengers reacting to the increasing speed of the train, the usual track bumps now more pronounced. The train accelerates further. David's gaze shifts to the seat in front of him, noting that the little girl is no longer watching him. Looking across, he sees the ground slowly receding in the windows behind other passengers. Meanwhile, a ten-year-old boy, sprawled on his family's couch with his head on the floor, watches television upside down, his brown hair fanning out around his flushed face.",
    "1306": "Joseph DUNNE, flipping through channels with his remote control, bypasses the upside-down cartoons and talk shows, finally pausing on an inverted image of a crashed train. As he watches, his knees propel him forward, causing him to tumble slowly off the couch and onto the carpet. The television screen displays a live aerial view of the smoldering train wreck below, where two trains are intertwined like serpents.\n\nRising from the floor, Joseph moves to a small table where a phone rests beside a notepad. The scene shifts abruptly to a physical therapy center bustling with activity; about a dozen people engage with specialized weight machines. Among them, an elderly woman sits on an exercise table, her breathing slow and deliberate. Nearby, Audrey averts her gaze.\n\nIn a different setting, an ancient secretary, without looking up, instinctively reaches for a pen with her right hand, positioning it over a blank pad while her left continues to type.\n\nRain pours heavily in the stadium where David, clad in a dark green rain poncho that nearly touches the ground, stands at the entrance of a tunnel leading to the field. The word 'security' on his back is almost faded, and his face is barely visible under the hood. A football game is underway on the vast field, the players appearing unusually small. David steps out into the rain.\n\nInside a quiet room, David and another person stand awkwardly for a moment. Audrey struggles to hide her reaction to an odd question, while Elijah sits fixated on a dark television screen, his face tense and unyielding. His mother speaks her next words in a near whisper. Elijah shifts his gaze from the television to her, noting the emotion in her face. A silence settles between them as Elijah contemplates her words, looking at her with disbelief.\n\nOn a playground, Elijah, cautious of the other children playing around him, approaches a bench where a present awaits. He sits, placing the flat package on his lap; its edges droop over his thin legs. Carefully, he unties the white bow, removes the clear tape, and unfolds the brown paper to reveal a single comic book. As he stares at it, he senses his mother's presence and turns to see her taking a seat beside him. His intelligent, piercing eyes meet hers briefly before returning to the comic. He opens the first page to see two figures engaged in a fierce battle atop a building, one muscular and masked.",
    "1307": "In a unique art gallery filled with comic book images and sketches, Elijah, a man who is half human and half animal, glances at a businessman next to him, then focuses on a sketch. The businessman rubs his face and continues to gaze at the sketch. Elijah, using his walking stick, moves toward the back of the store but suddenly stops by jamming the stick into the thick carpet. He turns around and heads back to the businessman, shaking his head vigorously. His eyes piercing, Elijah points at the sketch before turning to face the gallery's customers for the first time.\n\nAmong the visitors, David Dunne stands with his son, Joseph. Elijah stands motionless, staring at them for an extended period before approaching closer. When he finally speaks, his voice carries a whispery tone. David nods in response, and though Elijah appears shaken, he maintains eye contact with David and points at the framed comic sketches. David, showing frustration through a smile, shakes his head. Elijah watches as David and Joseph make their way to the front door and observes through the window as Joseph holds David's hand while they cross the street. Standing at the window, Elijah remains in a daze.\n\nLater, David, lying in bed, stares intently at a torn newspaper section in his hands, while Joseph sleeps across his legs. David carefully slides out from under his son’s legs, causing Joseph to stir but not awaken. David then moves to a dark corner of the room and opens a closet door. Inside, he pulls a chain, turning on a bare hanging bulb. He steps into the cramped space, partially closing the door to prevent the light from disturbing Joseph.\n\nInside the narrow closet, David reaches up to the top shelf and brings down an object wrapped in a t-shirt. Unwrapping it, he reveals a handgun. After a brief moment of contemplation, he wraps it up again and returns it to its high shelf, stretching further to reach a folder stuffed with newspaper clippings. Opening the folder, he sees a photograph of himself in a youthful football uniform triumphantly raising his helmet. As he flips through the clippings, all related to his football days, he reaches the bottom and finds a specially folded newspaper headline. David compares this new headline with an old one; they strikingly resemble a set, down to their similar fonts. His attention is drawn intensely to the old headline and a photo of a severely damaged, overturned car on a highway.",
    "1310": "Joseph tenderly reaches back to grasp his father's hand, connecting with David who gazes down at his patient son. David's attention shifts as he turns to inspect the barbell, meticulously counting the black metal discs stacked on it before returning his focus to Joseph. The young boy also turns his attention back to the barbell, his breathing becoming labored as he completes his task with the weights and rejoins his father.\n\nDavid settles onto his back, gripping the barbell and lifting it off the armrest with determination. He brings it down to his chest, his arms straining under the weight. With considerable effort, he manages to raise and lower the bar twice before it clangs back onto the armrest. Sitting up, David rotates fully to reassess the barbell, again counting the black discs on the steel bar, fixating on the heavy black steel circles.\n\nBoth father and son fix their eyes on the weights, while Joseph positions himself at the foot of the stairs leading up to the house, waiting patiently. David, taking another deep breath, heaves the weight off the armrest once more. His arms tremble intensely as he lifts it for the second time, his face contorted in a grimace as he lowers and raises the bar to his chest twice before it drops back onto the rest.\n\nAttached to the weights, a set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans dangle by their metal handles on each side, swaying slightly as David heaves the bar off his chest. His arms shake violently with the effort. Sitting up, David turns back to scrutinize the weights, his lips moving silently as he calculates the combined weight of the discs and the cans, pausing as he absorbs the figures.\n\nMeanwhile, Elijah remains fixated on an abstract point in the room, his head barely nodding as the physician's words fade into the background. At a physical therapy center, a co-worker takes over Audrey's duties beside an elderly man on a stationary bike. Audrey, with a warm smile, crosses the center to approach another client. Elijah's leg, held straight and immobilized by a metal brace, underscores his condition.",
    "1311": "David, concealed under his shirt, has bandages tightly wrapped around his ribs. Suddenly, Audrey is caught off guard by an unexpected question, prompting her to gaze intently at Elijah. In response, Elijah beams warmly, and Audrey reciprocates with a gentle smile. His smile widens further, yet Audrey's eyes freeze in a moment of stillness.\n\nIn another scene, David positions himself at the entrance of a tunnel leading to the upper section of the second level of a crowded venue. Around him, waves of people flow from their seats to the bathrooms and concession stands, creating a bustling environment. Standing aside, David leans against the wall, his gaze averted from the crowd. Eventually, he steps away from the wall and merges into the stream of moving people. As he navigates through the thickest part of the crowd, people bump into him, yet his eyes remain downcast, his expression serene, as though he's listening intently.\n\nAmidst this, a stocky woman collides with him. David then nods to a boy near a thermometer, and shifts his focus to a white-haired nurse and another woman, appearing lost in contemplation before looking up at the nurse. Nearby, Joseph finally raises his head, his eyes brimming with tears. David, sitting closer to Joseph on a bench, feels the weight of his son's stare.\n\nBack at home, David is rinsing a bowl when Audrey enters the kitchen. He quickly turns off the water, and Audrey catches the shock on his face. She turns around and lets out a scream. In front of her, Joseph is sobbing intensely, holding the handgun from David's closet in his outstretched hands, aimed directly at David. David exchanges a tense glance with Audrey and begins to sidestep to his right. Joseph tracks his movement with the gun's barrel, leading both to pause. The young boy's face tightens, a mix of confusion and desperation evident as tears stream down his cheeks. As he starts to press the trigger, the hammer clicks back, but Joseph freezes. David, catching Audrey's eye and then refocusing on Joseph, grows still as the gravity of the situation sinks in, leaving him visibly unsteady.\n\nElsewhere, Elijah, for the first time, seems shaken, as David regards him with a cold stare. At a comic store, a man with a ponytail notices that the motionless head of a customer belongs to a man in a wheelchair - Elijah. The ponytail man approaches and finds Elijah in a quiet daze. He leans over, shakes his head, and begins to wheel Elijah toward the front of the store. As they move down a narrow aisle lined with comics, Elijah suddenly seizes the left wheel, turning the chair sharply. His immobilized left leg strikes a rack of comic books, marking a sudden end to their movement.",
    "1312": "In a comic book store, a handful of comics tumble to the floor. A man with a ponytail straightens a wheelchair and begins to move down the aisle. After a few feet, Elijah, the occupant of the wheelchair, suddenly jerks and grabs the other wheel, causing the wheelchair to violently ram into the opposite wall. This action dislodges more comics, which scatter onto the wheelchair and the surrounding ground. They continue down the aisle until Elijah abruptly jerks the wheelchair to the left again, crashing into two racks. Comics cover Elijah as he sits slightly hunched over, his eyes fixed on a comic book in his lap. For the first time, his expression changes. The man with the ponytail moves to the front counter, dials a number, and glances at Elijah while waiting for a response. Elijah then raises a single comic book in his hand.\n\nThe scene shifts to a trendy restaurant where David and Audrey sit close together on stools at the bar, deep in thought as they sip their drinks. Audrey leans closer to David, whose grin fades slowly. They are only a foot apart as David sips his drink and glances at Audrey, who waits for his response. Her face tenses, on the verge of upset, and her eyes glaze with water. David's eyes meet hers, holding her gaze for what feels like an eternity. This moment marks their second date as a husband and wife.\n\nAs they prepare to leave, David pulls out his wallet while Audrey stands beside him. A babysitter with black-dyed hair and Buddy Holly glasses waits at the doorway, ready to depart. Audrey tries to hide her smile, which instantly fades as the babysitter notices their suddenly quiet faces. David hands the babysitter money, and she opens the door to a rainy night outside. She covers her head with her jacket and runs down the walkway before closing the door behind her. Inside, Audrey removes her coat and heads to the guest bedroom, disappearing inside. In the dimly lit kitchen, only the counter light is on. David stands by the phone as the driver of a truck approaches him, slipping and sliding. David's attention shifts to Audrey, who lies shivering in the grass, then back to the driver.\n\nMeanwhile, Elijah closes his eyes, his face filling with strength. The scene transitions to the mystical interior of a train station, a vast room the size of a football field, lined with giant pillars that ascend into a misty, hand-painted ceiling. David stands in a quiet corner, observing the faces of passengers arriving and departing on late-night trains.",
    "1314": "On a bustling Christmas Eve, a disgruntled Santa, known off-season as Willie T. Soke, abruptly shoves a child off his lap and sends him on his way. Nearby, an elf, peeling off a pointed prosthetic ear, nods in acknowledgment. Willie, reaching into the cushions of his throne, pulls out a bottle of Old Grandad and takes a hearty swig.\n\nAs the store's closing time approaches, the sound of circuits shutting down echoes through the now-empty departments. The last of the store employees exit past an old security guard. Eventually, Santa emerges from his post. The security guard then moves to a panel by the doorway, presses the ARM key, and exits, locking the door behind him as he heads home.\n\nSuddenly, a teddy bear springs to life, dashing out of the room and sliding down the space between the escalator railings. It frantically navigates through the store, crashing into displays and, in its haste, tearing the arm off a mannequin while passing a clothing section. The bear skids to a stop at the base of an alarm box, too short to reach the controls.\n\nIn a surprising twist, the teddy bear removes its head to reveal Marcus Skidmore, Santa's elf in civilian life. Panting heavily and covered in sweat, Marcus flips open a hasp and swings a door wide, revealing Willie indulging in beer. Willie finishes his drink, crushes the can, and drops it among several others at his feet. Marcus, sneering, lumbers past him.\n\nMarcus then methodically breaks into jewelry cases, carefully selecting specific items and placing them into a stock cart. Consulting a typed list, he continues his meticulous gathering across the store, amassing an eclectic collection that includes furs, gowns, shoes, and makeup.\n\nArriving at another doorway, Marcus peers inside to see Willie operating a large water drill on the store's vault. As Willie pulls the drill back on its track, Marcus approaches closer. Willie then uses a screwdriver and a sledgehammer on the vault's lock, and soon the door swings open, spilling bundles of cash onto the floor. Both men are visibly impressed by their haul.\n\nLater, Willie settles into the rear bench of a van, while Marcus takes the passenger seat beside his Filipina mail-order wife, Lois. Dressed in gaudy, expensive clothes, Lois wears a perpetual look of pruney distaste. The van speeds away into the Christmas Eve night, vanishing into the distance like the down of a thistle.\n\nThe scene shifts abruptly to the next morning, where an alarm clock rings insistently. Willie, groggy and bleary-eyed, wakes up to face another day.",
    "1315": "Willie, still groggy, struggles to switch off his alarm, his fingers clumsy with sleep. His frustration mounts through a series of grunts and groans until he unleashes a final scream, expelling his irritation. He discovers a half-full beer bottle with a floating cigarette butt in his grasp, which he promptly drinks before heading to the bathroom to brush his teeth.\n\nAt lunchtime, Willie strolls to a high-end restaurant. As he walks by, he swiftly grabs a bunch of car keys from the valet's key-box and continues on his way. In the parking lot, he tests different key fobs, setting off car alarms until a brand new Cadillac responds. Satisfied, Willie climbs in and drives away.\n\nWhile driving, he retrieves the car's registration from the glove compartment and zeroes in on the owner's address. In a luxurious marble bathroom, Willie sits on the toilet, casually flipping through a magazine with a beer bottle at hand. His pants are down around his ankles. After standing and securing his belt, he attempts to flush the toilet, but after a few clanking efforts, he abandons the task, picks up his beer, and leaves.\n\nWandering around the room, Willie systematically knocks paintings off the walls until he uncovers a hidden safe in the bedroom. A grin spreads across his face as he pulls out a stethoscope and successfully opens the safe, revealing stacks of cash. He then scratches a lottery ticket, now adorned with a new Rolex and a flashy ring.\n\nAs someone exits, Willie activates a machine and moves on to the next message. In the scorching heat of the Saguaro Square Mall parking lot, Willie and Marcus, dressed as Santa and an elf, trudge across the asphalt, visibly sweating and panting. Willie finishes a pint of Smirnoff's, casually tossing the bottle toward a trash can, and pops some Tic Tacs from his pocket.\n\nHarrison strides past them angrily as they approach the store, causing Willie and Marcus to halt and watch him storm out, joined by Bob Chipeska. A beautiful woman in tight pants catches Willie's eye, and he fixates on her, lost in his thoughts. This reaction alarms Marcus, who responds with a silent, exaggerated display of laughter, quickly regaining his composure.",
    "1316": "In the bustling environment of Saguaro Square Mall, Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is cared for by several of Santa's elf mannequins, one dressed in cowboy attire and another sporting a poncho and sombrero. A queue of eager children forms, waiting patiently. Amidst the excitement, Marcus navigates through the line, captivating the young audience with his flair. He entertains them further by grabbing a bottle from the ground near his feet and taking a swig, his performance drawing gasps and cheers from the kids.\n\nMarcus's attention shifts as he spots Willie; in a swift motion, Marcus snatches a hat, forcefully plants it against Willie's chest, and as Willie attempts to stand, Marcus delivers a kick to his backside. Simultaneously, on the mall's outskirts, a city bus hisses to a stop, its doors revealing an eight-year-old boy, visibly overweight, unkempt, and possibly emitting an odor of urine. As this child approaches the mall entrance, he passes a group of older kids skillfully executing skateboard tricks, who momentarily pause to watch him.\n\nInside, Marcus engages with another young boy, seating him on his lap, before making his way towards a rope. The snot-nosed kid, next in line and frozen with fear, is spurred into motion by Marcus's approach. Marcus then leads the boy to a throne where Willie is seated, placing the boy onto Willie's lap. The boy remains still, save for a stream of mucus flowing from his nose, which Willie cannot help but fixate on. Suddenly, the boy reaches out and pulls Willie's beard, stretching it taut under Willie's chin. In response, Willie shoves the boy away, who retreats while maintaining a look of awe and reverence.\n\nLater, the boy is seen sitting on a bench, his eyes fixed on the entrance to Chamberlain's. After a moment, Willie and Marcus, dressed in costume, emerge and head towards the parking lot. The boy follows them at a cautious distance across the vast, deserted lot, drawing close enough to overhear their conversation.\n\nThe scene shifts to a large, rustic-themed bar packed with middle-management types, their ties loosened. Willie's attention scans the room until it lands on a drunken Hindustani Troublemaker, whose stare momentarily startles him. A woman at the bar pours two drinks, which Willie and she quickly down. As she pours another round, Willie watches her intently. Meanwhile, the Troublemaker's focus is broken by the boy, who has approached and is now pounding on his legs, allowing Willie a moment to compose himself.\n\nLater, Willie drives with the boy seated beside him, his mind preoccupied and his eyes scanning for road signs. They eventually arrive at a grandiose Southwestern home, where Willie escorts the boy along an extended walkway leading to the front door, taking a moment to appreciate the lavish surroundings.",
    "1317": "Grandma, aided by her walker, rises from her chair and begins shuffling toward Willie. She is dressed in a bathrobe, her thick glasses perched on her nose, with another pair dangling from a chain around her neck. Willie observes the elderly woman as she innocently putters away, her mind clouded by senility.\n\nSuddenly, Willie yanks off his mask and turns to face the Kid, who shakes his head, a silent gesture of disbelief or disagreement. The room is filled with the sound of a tumbler tripping, and light floods in as the safe door swings open, revealing Willie, a smile on his face, stethoscope still in his ears. In the foreground, a few stacks of cash and a folio are visible. Willie reaches into the safe, grabs the folio, and starts flipping through its contents.\n\nThe scene cuts to a new Mercedes speeding through the frame, its engine noise fading as it disappears. Left behind is the Kid, standing at the curb, waving happily. Willie and Marcus then walk to their cars, their steps purposeful. Opal watches them, her eyes filled with disdain. Reluctantly, she moves closer to them.\n\nLater, Willie is seen using a pay phone. The Kid swings the door open to reveal Willie standing on the stoop, holding a small grip. Like a puppy dog, the Kid follows Willie as he explores the house, bumping open doors and examining his surroundings. Willie discovers the master bedroom, which appears to have been long unused. He tosses his grip onto the double bed.\n\nIn the bathroom, Willie lies motionless in the tub, a wet washcloth covering his face, his fingers resting against a tumbler filled with ice and an amber liquid that sits on the tub's edge. From under the washcloth, he drags it off his face and looks at the Kid, who meets his gaze, unperturbed.\n\nIn another part of the house, a woman glances in as someone passes by. Still chewing, she retrieves her notebook and scribbles something down. Willie, fixated on a board, stares at it for a long moment before suddenly leaping up, screaming, and flinging the board across the room. The Kid's face, unfazed and still smiling, watches the outburst.\n\nThe Kid is later seen sleeping peacefully in bed. Meanwhile, in the Jacuzzi, Willie engages in intimate activity with Sue, wearing his Santa hat. Blearily, she gazes back at him. Willie closes the door and, with a series of quick gulps, finishes off a bottle, delicately placing it down afterward. Moments later, he faints, collapsing to the floor with a heavy thud.\n\nWillie wakes on the floor to the sound of a scream. A bedroom door crashes open, and the Kid emerges, screaming, running directly into Willie. Bouncing off, the Kid continues screaming down the hall. As Willie turns the corner, he sees a row of fresh, bloody palm prints lining one side of the hallway. At the far end, the Kid, still screaming, disappears from view.",
    "1319": "Gin meticulously attaches the cables, setting the stage for the unfolding events. As she leans down towards Gin, the focus shifts to the bustling department store scene. In the Men's Wear section, Lois stands behind Jesse, her face contorted into a pruney frown of disapproval. Seizing an opportunity while Jesse is distracted, Lois subtly nudges a table laden with sweaters a few feet across the floor. The table emits a sharp SQUEEEEEEEAK, but the sound is drowned out by the store's chaos, unnoticed by the shoppers. Pleased with her strategic placement, Lois exits through the door.\n\nElsewhere, Willie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate, inhaling its contents deeply. Nearby, Marcus winces, his grimace betraying his discomfort. Jesse, meanwhile, moves to the alarm panel by the doorway and decisively presses the key marked ARM, initiating a countdown displayed on an LED readout that starts at 30 seconds.\n\nMarcus reaches a vent above the surveillance room, fishes out a remote control purchased by Lois from his pocket, and directs it downward, causing the massive array of VCRs to power down. Continuing his mission, Marcus approaches the edge of a descending duct.\n\nWillie's focus remains fixated on the safe; he stares at it intensely, licking his lips in anticipation. As Marcus emerges from a stockroom pushing a cart, ready to embark on a shopping spree, Willie begins his task on the safe by applying a stethoscope, tapping and listening with acute attention. Marcus, on his spree, starts in Ladies' Accessories, selecting a cashmere scarf.\n\nThe intensity escalates as Willie applies a drill to the safe, only to pull it back shortly after. Simultaneously, Marcus, now in Evening Wear, jumps repeatedly, attempting to yank a stole from a mannequin. Willie, determined, hammers a chisel into the safe door's seam. Marcus's efforts continue as he leaps at the mannequin persistently.\n\nWillie climbs atop the safe and swings a sledgehammer at its lock, his actions growing more frenzied. Marcus, in a different part of the store, swings a golf club at the mannequin's knees, eventually chopping it down to retrieve its stole. Willie, relentless, uses a plasma welder on the safe, then returns to pounding it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each strike.\n\nIn a more detailed approach, Willie, now hunched at the safe's back, presses a stethoscope to its surface, tapping with two knuckles. The sound through the stethoscope reveals hollow THUNKS followed by an unnaturally loud CREEEEEEEEAK. Willie reacts with a quizzical expression before rising after a moment of consideration. The safe's door, visible from the far side, slowly finishes creaking open.\n\nMarcus enters the room, meeting Willie's gaze. He begins to remove stacks of cash, efficiently loading them into a Santa sack. Meanwhile, Willie faces a decision between two stuffed elephants: a big, fuzzy, smiling pink one and a purple one behind it. His hand hesitates but ultimately chooses the purple elephant, only to return it and select the pink one instead. Willie turns around, now holding the pink stuffed elephant.\n\nThe scene closes with Marcus and Lois standing together, presenting a grotesque tableau. Lois's shopping cart is filled to the brim with an eclectic assortment of items: shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, and an abdomen exerciser, encapsulating the chaotic culmination of their day's endeavors.",
    "1320": "In the opening scene, a reflection catches our eye as a dark shape rapidly descends upon us. This figure, cloaked in a tattered trench coat, crashes onto the pavement, hands outstretched to cushion the fall. After a moment, he rises to his feet, clearly recovering from a significant tumble. His appearance is striking: chiseled features, a shaved head, and deep-set eyes. He surveys his surroundings, which are nothing more than towering brick walls. Suddenly, rain begins to pelt down heavily.\n\nThe man, identified as Michael, pulls his overcoat tightly around him and sprints toward the alley's exit. He emerges onto the street just as a fleet of police cars, sirens blaring, rounds the corner heading in his direction. Quickly, Michael runs his finger along the edge of a knife before shedding his overcoat, exposing a bare chest covered in dark tattoos. As his coat hits the ground, the camera shifts to the brick wall behind him, where Michael's shadow is seen crouching.\n\nThe rain intensifies, almost as if it's a divine retribution. Amidst this downpour, the knife's blade glimmers as it swiftly moves downward. Then, abruptly, there is silence. Michael, his face etched with pain yet his trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, his gaze fixed with determination on a dark storefront across the street.\n\nWithout hesitation, Michael smashes through a skylight and drops into the building in a cascade of glass. Inside, he tosses a first-aid kit into a sink. His trench coat falls, and under the fluorescent lights, his figure is more clearly visible. Turning his back to a mirror, he reveals two horrifically open wounds running down between his shoulder blades. With precision, he uses fishing wire instead of thread to stitch these wounds closed, blood pooling on the cement floor around him.\n\nOnce dressed again, Michael urgently moves through endless racks of guns, his movements meticulous and trained. He selects weapon after weapon, filling rifle bags with them. With his arsenal prepared, he makes his way toward the exit, only to find the place securely locked with a metal gate over the front doors and bars over the windows.\n\nMeanwhile, two cops, displaying their exhaustion with the world, patrol the downtown area. One of them, Burton, harbors a deep-seated loathing for the city's rain-soaked inhabitants, the shadowy figures in doorways, and the streetwalkers. In a gesture of contempt, he points his finger like a gun, mimicking shooting at the people they drive past. In the distance, the sound of gunfire pops, and the police radio crackles with urgent and overlapping chatter.\n\nBack with Michael, he drops the gun-filled bags to the ground and slowly places his palms on his skull, signaling a moment of surrender or contemplation.",
    "1329": "As they pause to assess the police car, Kyle hands the shotgun to Bob. Charlie's face brightens upon spotting the vehicle, and she dashes from the diner just as the police car's door swings open. The three men notice her approach, with Jeep's expression turning slack. They start to chase after her, but then a figure emerges from the police car. Charlie halts a short distance from the vehicle, startled by the familiar, intense eyes of Michael, who looks at her as though he had anticipated her presence. Quickly, Bob, Kyle, and Jeep position themselves protectively around Charlie, and Bob lifts the shotgun. A tense moment passes as Michael studies Bob, his face expressionless. Then, Michael breaks into a menacing smile, revealing his less-than-perfect yet ordinary teeth. The tension eases slightly, prompting Bob to lower the gun and chuckle briefly. However, when Michael does not reciprocate, the atmosphere tightens again, and Bob silently raises the shotgun once more.\n\nMichael surveys the motley crew before him and then his gaze shifts to a body wrapped in a loosely flapping plastic tablecloth in front of the diner. Turning back to Bob, Michael simply shakes his head and moves purposefully toward Charlie, only to be stopped by Bob, who blocks his path with the shotgun. Suddenly, Kyle alerts Michael to something out on the road, causing Michael to forcefully return the gun to Bob's hands, leaving Bob speechless. Michael strides to the back of the police cruiser, opens the trunk, and unveils an impressive array of weapons. After selecting twin MP5s for himself and grabbing boxes of shotgun shells, a flicker of light precedes flashlight beams that pierce the darkness and settle on Michael's pale face. He glances upward as a hatch opens, and he emerges alongside Bob, Percy, and Kyle.\n\nMichael is about to respond when two headlights materialize in the darkness, and an ice cream truck approaches the diner slowly. The driver remains obscured by the darkness. Following instructions, the men ready themselves, exchanging anxious glances with Percy. Meanwhile, Charlie and Audrey peek through the slatted windows of the diner. The ice cream truck's headlights sweep across the building, prompting Audrey and Charlie to step back from the windows. Charlie moves next to Jeep and places a comforting hand on his arm. Howard offers a weak smile at the sound of the calliope from the truck, which comes to a stop with its headlights directed at the diner. Tension mounts as everyone levels their guns at the vehicle.",
    "1330": "As the movie begins, a dark, bloody shoe steps out of an ice cream truck onto the ground. The camera pans up a long, grey pant leg dotted with blood stains, revealing a skeletally thin man dressed in tattered coveralls. As he steps into the headlights, his tall figure becomes even clearer. He surveys his surroundings—the diner, the garage, the roof—assessing the situation. On the roof, men wait anxiously for something to happen. Suddenly, the Ice Cream Man's jaw unhinges, stretching grotesquely, causing everyone except Michael to nearly hyperventilate with fear. With startling speed, the Ice Cream Man, moving more like a human insect than a normal man, bolts toward the diner.\n\nMichael takes aim and fires, bullets tearing into the creature and knocking it flat on its back, its limbs twisted and twitching. Michael keeps his weapon trained on the fallen creature. The sound of engines rumbling grows louder, accompanied by the glare of headlights. A variety of vehicles burst through a wall of dust on the freeway, racing toward the diner. They swerve and collide violently, and dark shapes quickly scatter from the burning wreckage.\n\nIn the chaos, Howard's body is suddenly torn away from Sandra, something gripping his legs. This jolts Sandra awake, and she screams, desperately holding on. Charlie and Audrey rush to Sandra's side, grabbing Howard's arms. Jeep, closely following, is ready to shoot the creature but can't get a clear shot with the women in the way. He discards his gun and joins in pulling Howard back. A human tug-of-war ensues, with Howard's body being torturously stretched. As Howard is pulled further out the window, only a few more inches separate Charlie from certain death. Jeep struggles, and both he and Charlie fall back into the diner, the claw-like hands still grasping Charlie's arm but no longer attached to their owners.\n\nMichael leaps over Charlie, armed with a butcher's knife in one hand and a machine gun in the other. The window blinds burst into a wall of fire. Charlie frantically removes the severed appendages from her arm, and she and Jeep scoot away from the window. Hysterical, Sandra tries to push past Michael to go after Howard, but Michael intercepts her, carrying her away from the danger and thrusting her down into a back booth. As Sandra frantically slaps at him, about to say something, Kyle rushes into the room with a smile on his face. However, his excitement quickly fades as he notices the broken window and assesses the room.\n\nBob grabs Kyle's arm, and all eyes turn to Michael, who looks squarely at Percy. Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond. Suddenly, all eyes shift to Charlie, who reacts in shock.",
    "1331": "In response to shocking news, Charlie can only react by bursting into laughter. Her face drains of color as the reality of the situation sinks in. Michael nods in acknowledgment, while Charlie sways unsteadily. Jeep quickly steadies her by resting a hand on her shoulder. With a resounding clank, Michael re-arms his weapon and turns to the group decisively. Percy watches him skeptically, and Kyle, fear evident in his eyes, shifts his gaze from Percy to the looming darkness and the evil that envelops them.\n\nMeanwhile, Bob multitasks effortlessly, flicking his trusty Zippo with one hand while expertly grilling steaks with the other. He pauses momentarily to take a swig from a can of beer. Across the counter, Sandra sits, her gaze fixed on a prescription bottle tipped before her, surrounded by scattered pills. Bob, noticing the despair in her eyes, pulls another can of beer from under the counter, opens it, and gently places it in front of her. She looks up, offers a weak smile, and takes a sip. The weight of her grief returns as soon as she speaks.\n\nIn a booth across the diner, Audrey tampers with Percy's old radio. At the front, Jeep quietly assists Michael in boarding up the shattered window with broken table planks. Jeep's eyes catch the unusual tattoos trailing down Michael's arms and the two jagged wounds peeking above his shirt line. Michael pauses, considering how much to reveal, before driving the final nail into place, effectively securing the window. He then heads for the roof, leaving Jeep deep in thought.\n\nOutside, a faint glimmer of sunlight pierces through a dark red, dusty haze. On the roof, Michael scans the horizon for any signs of movement while, on the other side, Bob struggles to stay awake, his eyes drooping closed.\n\nSandra suddenly awakens, startled. She spins around, searching for the source of her name being called, and turns toward the back door, which is blocked by a desk. With trepidation, she approaches the door slowly, her expression stricken. Noticing the transom window above the door, she climbs onto the desk, stretches up, and peers out to see her husband Howard. His skin is grotesquely covered with black, breathing boils. Overwhelmed by horror, Sandra goes slack. In her struggle, she accidentally elbows Kyle, who falls to the ground.\n\nJust as Sandra reaches for the door handle, Audrey leaps onto her, preventing her from opening it. Percy jumps up in response. Howard is revealed to be nailed to an upside-down cross outside. In the ensuing chaos, Sandra, in an attempt to free herself, slaps Audrey hard, causing her to stumble over Kyle and crash to the floor.",
    "1332": "Percy emerges in the doorway, catching the attention of those inside. Suddenly, Sandra flings open the back door, triggering a surreal shift as the world slips into slow motion. Howard stands just a few feet away, miraculously alive. Sandra charges towards him, with Percy trailing closely behind her. As the scene's tempo abruptly returns to normal, Howard's body horrifically bursts, sending dark fluid spurting towards Sandra. In a swift move, Percy whirls around Sandra, taking the brunt of the spray on his back, protecting her. He then forcefully ushers Sandra back into the diner, the door slamming shut behind them. Inside, Percy releases Sandra, who staggers hysterically into the room. Kyle and Jeep quickly restrain her, pressing her to the floor. \n\nCharlie glances at Percy, who remains standing by the door, his breathing heavy. He attempts a step forward but collapses. The entire back of his body has been horrifically burned. His lifeless body is later covered and placed on a table, with Bob gazing mournfully at his deceased friend, tears streaming down his face. From the doorway, Jeep watches his father, while Keyl, feeling defeated, looks over at Charlie, who is seething with rising anger.\n\nCharlie seeks solace at the sink, a cigarette hanging from her lips as water flows, stealing a private moment. She inhales deeply, the smoke filling her lungs, her demeanor defiant. Catching her reflection in the mirror, she traces the curve of her belly with her hand. Overwhelmed by fear and anger, tears fill her eyes. In a surge of frustration, she stamps out her cigarette. Jeep notices the strain on her face, pausing thoughtfully before her. Turning to face him, bitterness floods Charlie's expression. Jeep's face hardens; he rises, visibly hurt and frustrated, and walks away, leaving Charlie disturbed and surprised by his reaction.\n\nAs the invisible sun descends, Kyle and Audrey huddle together on the roof, vigilant. Kyle demonstrates the proper way to handle an MP5, which Audrey wields confidently, as if she's long been familiar with firearms. Kyle's expression registers surprise. After a moment, Audrey safely secures the weapon and returns it to him. Gazing into the red haze around them, Audrey's expression grows distant, as though she has aged years in mere hours. She confesses something with a smile, leaning in close to Kyle, suggesting a deeper connection beyond mere desire.\n\nSuddenly, spotlights on the roof sign activate, illuminating the area. Below, the gas pumps light up, and the station's fluorescents flicker on. Bob's TV screen comes alive with rolling static. Jeep and Michael move to peer through the window slats, while inside, Charlie gently offers Sandra a drink of water through a straw.",
    "1334": "As Eponine lies dying, Marius kneels beside her, cradling her as she passes away in his arms. Overwhelmed by grief, Marius looks up at the others, tears streaming down his face, and extends a note. Meanwhile, the landlady ascends the stairs with Gavroche in tow. The door slightly opens to reveal a cautious Valjean, who appears deeply distressed. He points out Javert, bound in a shadowy corner, and their eyes lock in a tense, silent exchange.\n\nSuddenly, Valjean spots snipers on the rooftops, aiming at Enjolras. Reacting swiftly, he grabs a gun and fires, scattering the snipers. Other students quickly join the fray, driving the attackers back as gunfire erupts from both ends of the street. The brief skirmish concludes with the snipers vanishing from sight. Enjolras turns to Valjean, while Javert listens with a grim sense of satisfaction. Valjean then cuts Javert free with a knife but aims a gun at him.\n\nAmidst the chaos, Marius frantically works to fortify a smaller barricade. Nearby, Grantaire, in a drunken stupor, begins singing a drinking song, which Feuilly picks up more earnestly as bottles circulate among the group. As Valjean moves through the cafe, he overhears Marius singing below a window. Drawn to the sound, Valjean approaches and listens, deeply moved by Marius's melody. Later, unable to sleep, Valjean paces inside the cafe, eventually stopping to gaze at the sleeping Marius through the window. He then kneels beside the slumbering figure.\n\nFrom above, the scene cranes up to reveal the barricaded street encircled by a vast number of waiting soldiers, making it clear that the small band of rebels is vastly outnumbered. Many rebels are asleep, and as the camera continues to rise, the barricade becomes a mere dark speck amidst the bright lights of Paris. The sun remains hidden below the rooftops.\n\nAs dawn breaks, Enjolras re-enters the barricade through a secret gate. Below, the students are awake and preparing, though a heavy silence and uncertainty hang in the air, and no one dares to leave. The first rays of sunlight illuminate Gavroche just as a musket shot rings out, striking him down onto the barricade. Enjolras surveys his pitifully small group as the sun rises above the city, followed by a massive barrage of musket fire.\n\nValjean moves among the rebels, tending to the wounded and respectfully handling the dead, heedless of his own safety. The battle intensifies as the big guns unleash a relentless bombardment on the barricade, causing it to shake under the explosive impacts.",
    "1336": "Emerging from a church into a graveyard, Jean Valjean approaches a bell perched on the edge of a promontory. With determination, he tears a yellow paper into fragments and casts them out over the expansive valley below. The camera follows these scraps as they dance whimsically in the breeze before descending into the abyss. The fluttering pieces of paper are briefly seen caught in the wind, while below them stretches a precipitous drop to a shadowy valley.\n\nThe camera then ascends rapidly, leaving Valjean and the town of Digne far beneath, soaring towards the sun which dramatically pierces through the sky, with the majestic Alps looming in the distance. Amidst this ascent, a single scrap of paper spirals upward, illuminated by the sunlight. Suddenly, the camera tumbles downward through layers of mist and clouds, traversing time and space, until it reaches the muddy estuary of a town where ships rest at low tide beside red brick factory buildings.\n\nThe camera then races towards three horses galloping down a muddy road across a flat plain, heading towards the fortified town of Montreuil-sur-Mer, which sits strategically on an estuary leading to the sea. As the riders approach and enter the town, the camera captures the desperate scene at the gates where the poor and sick are gathered, hoping to gain entry. Javert, observing the scene, remains expressionless as the police force enters the harbor, pushing back the beggars as the gates momentarily open and close.\n\nInside the factory, rows of conservatively dressed women are busily crafting jewelry from shellac, a black resin resembling jet. The Foreman pauses next to Fantine, a striking young woman, and as he leans in to whisper, she pricks her finger in surprise. As the workday ends, the women begin to remove their overalls and pack up their tools. Fantine, in a quiet moment, pulls out a letter which is swiftly snatched by the main factory woman. Fantine desperately tries to retrieve her letter, which is covertly passed along the line of workers until the main factory woman takes it to the Foreman, sparking a scuffle among the women.\n\nThe owner then steps onto the factory floor, his appearance markedly changed: clean-shaven and well-fed, it is Jean Valjean. His gaze catches Javert appearing on the first-floor balcony of his office, causing Valjean's world to seemingly collapse. On the factory floor, Fantine continues to plead her case to the Foreman amidst the singing of the women. The Foreman forcibly moves Fantine away, and from below, she turns and desperately calls out to Valjean in his office above. Valjean, momentarily distracted, returns to the stairs leading to his office, pausing only to show some demonstration samples of their work, and casts a sharp glance towards the unfolding scene below.",
    "1339": "In the courtroom, the judge is left speechless by the unexpected turn of events. He approaches Valjean, gently guiding him out of the room. As they move, Fantine notices something unsettling over Valjean's shoulder. Suddenly, Fantine's body begins to convulse uncontrollably; her eyes glaze over as she tragically succumbs to her illness.\n\nValjean, now outside, is startled by the unmistakable sound of Javert's voice behind him. Turning to confront him, Valjean finds himself facing Javert, who menacingly draws his sword and points it directly at Valjean. In a swift move, Valjean seizes a piece of timber from the roof overhead. The two men then engage in a dramatic duel, their voices melding into a simultaneous song as they circle each other warily.\n\nMeanwhile, at the inn, Cosette, tasked with chores, goes to store the broom away. As she moves, Madame Thenardier mockingly mimics her singing. From her hiding spot, Cosette watches through a small gap in the wall, her eyes filled with fear. Eponine enters from outside, and Madame Thenardier discovers that Cosette, instead of leaving, is concealed behind a distant wall.\n\nOutside the inn, Madame Thenardier sets up a modest frost fair stall on the porch. Members of the innkeeper's gang, disguised as patrons who had been lingering outside, enter and recount a tale from Monsieur Thenardier's past to a newly recruited member. Madame Thenardier welcomes the newcomer inside. In a deft move, she drops a comb from her hair, which a helpful customer picks up, giving her the opportunity to stealthily lift his wallet from his back pocket as he rises. Simultaneously, Thenardier cunningly steals a pocket watch during a handshake, using it as a diversion. He fusses over his guests, going as far as urinating into the wine bottle he serves them, and later, rummaging through a groom's trousers for valuables.\n\nElsewhere, Cosette, struggling with the heavy buckets she filled at the well in the woods, trudges back to the inn. She takes a moment to rest under their weight, then looks up in astonishment to find Valjean standing before her. Valjean hands money to Thenardier, and then more, securing Cosette's freedom. He leads her to the door and lifts her into a waiting cab. As Madame Thenardier examines the money taken from her husband, through the open door, Thenardier spots a man on horseback approaching the inn. Javert confidently strides inside.\n\nValjean's cab speeds away along the road into the city. Inside, Valjean wraps a protective arm around Cosette, who drifts into a restless sleep under his watchful gaze. Their journey continues as they turn down a narrow street, no longer in a rush. Later, under the cover of darkness, they navigate through a shadowed street. Their pace quickens into a run as they dart through tight alleys and into small courtyards, unsure of their path. Desperate, Valjean finds a crumbling section of wall, and they scramble over it, seeking safety and freedom.",
    "1341": "As the scene unfolds, EPONINE is caught staring intently through a door at someone. She then halts, her gaze lingering wistfully on Marius as he steps out of the Gorbeau Tenement, only to be momentarily halted by a passing carriage. Once the carriage moves on, Marius spots two figures in the street: an elderly gentleman named Valjean and a stunning young woman, Cosette. They are distributing alms to beggars on their way back from evening church services. Marius finds himself unable to tear his eyes away from Cosette, and as if sensing his stare, she glances up and their eyes lock in a moment of mutual astonishment, as if they already know each other. Their connection is abruptly broken by a second carriage passing between them.\n\nAs Marius continues down the street, he glances back just as Cosette looks at him again. Valjean, sensing the gaze from afar, instinctively pulls Cosette closer, protectively shielding her from Marius's distant attention. Meanwhile, in an alleyway further down the street, the Thenardiers, disguised and accompanied by their gang of criminals including Babet, Brujon, Clacquesous, and Montparnasse, lie in wait for Valjean.\n\nThenardier cunningly lures Valjean into the alleyway where Madame Thenardier sits on the ground, cradling a crying infant. Cosette follows a few steps behind, still captivated by Marius. As Valjean leans down to inspect Madame Thenardier, she suddenly recognizes him. Thenardier then removes his disguise, and Valjean, in turn, recognizes him. With a signal from Thenardier, the gang menacingly closes in on Valjean. The tension escalates when a door in the alleyway swings open, revealing the imposing figure of Brujon. Both Marius and the street urchin Gavroche watch the unfolding chaos with keen interest.\n\nThe gang's confrontation spills out into the street, where they are unexpectedly met by Javert and his men. Javert notices a man with his arm protectively around a girl but fails to recognize Valjean, who cleverly keeps his face averted. Turning his attention back to the Thenardier gang in the alley, Javert's frustration mounts when he turns back to find that Valjean and Cosette have vanished.\n\nThenardier, eavesdropping, absorbs Javert's furious outburst with keen interest. Meanwhile, Cosette turns to see Marius still gazing down the street. Joly approaches Marius from behind, noting his distant expression. They sit together, and their laughter fills the air, though Enjolras remains unsmiling. As Enjolras turns to his companions, the students begin to sing, and Eponine enters, seeking to speak with Marius, who notices her presence.\n\nIn a different setting, Cosette paces anxiously in her pretty bedroom, the finest room in their small summer house, with its shutters open to a view of a wild, unkempt garden. Valjean knocks, enters her room, and closes the shutters before leaving for his own room. Cosette follows him into his simple wooden shack at the back of the summerhouse, where Valjean lives with stark simplicity, having given the best room to Cosette. Inside his room, Valjean sits on his bed, his back turned to Cosette.",
    "1343": "Along the streets, the silent faces of the impoverished wait expectantly. A column of dignitaries dressed in black suits, carrying laurel branches, proceeds solemnly. In synchronization with the slow beat of drums, the onlookers begin to sing softly. Amidst the crowd, we spot Enjolras, Marius, and other radical students. The dignitaries, now aware of the singing, exchange uneasy glances. A team of black horses, adorned with nodding black plumes, enters the scene, slowly pulling a gun carriage draped in the tricolour flag. As the coffin on the carriage aligns with the students, Enjolras boldly steps in front of the horses, halting the procession by waving the red flag.\n\nThe students then surge forward, breaking through the crowd to encircle the coffin carriage. Enjolras, Marius, Courfeyrac, and other students, led by Combeferre, climb onto the carriage top. The police and national guardsmen attempt to manage the swelling crowd, who in turn rally around the students, encircling the coffin carriage and passionately singing to thwart police intervention. Now, the crowd, along with the students led by Enjolras, has transformed into the procession itself. They deviate from the main street, veering away from the planned funeral route.\n\nAs the new procession turns, a cavalry division charges ahead, quickly disappearing around a corner. In this side street stands Gavroche's elephant, a prominent landmark. Gavroche himself slips away through a still-rising barricade. Grantaire, with some effort, extracts the last piece of furniture from Madame Hucheloup—her cherished sewing armchair—and adds it to the barricade. The barricade, now complete, forms an imposing twelve-foot-high wall, featuring a heavily guarded section that can be maneuvered to allow entry. Two smaller barricades flank the café, offering additional protection.\n\nEnjolras scales partway up the main barricade to address his gathered followers. Javert, disguised as a rebel, is allowed re-entry through the barricade's guarded 'gate.' A single flaming torch, ensconced in cobbles, casts light on a fluttering red flag atop the barricade. Attention shifts as everyone looks up to see Gavroche perched at the barricade's summit. Guns are quickly trained on Javert, who meets their gaze defiantly. Enjolras confronts him directly.\n\nSuddenly, bullets from gunfire ricochet off the surrounding houses, penetrate the barricade, and injure several men. The red flag falls, its pole severed. Time seems to stand still. Marius moves the torch closer to a powder keg, but the soldiers have already retreated. Marius descends from the barricade. As the group surrounds him in astonishment, he notices Eponine leaning against the barricade. With difficulty, she retrieves a letter from her pocket and presses it into his hand.",
    "1345": "Louis, driving, spots Alice and attempts to brake but fails, resulting in his car crashing violently. Alice, startled, stops cycling, her gaze fixed on her father's wrecked vehicle with a mix of fear and indecision, contemplating whether to return. Louis, bleeding profusely and severely injured, painfully shifts in his seat before glancing at the shattered rear-view mirror. Meanwhile, Alice, still looking back at the car, misses the approaching figure behind her. Deciding against returning, she turns and resumes cycling.\n\nStruggling, Louis attempts to exit his car, finding the driver's door jammed. He painfully makes his way to the passenger side and eventually escapes the vehicle, staggering drunkenly and bleeding as he screams in agony. In the backdrop, a factory, distant mountains, and an ominous plume of smoke are visible, accompanied by the faint sound of a siren.\n\nElsewhere, Joe stands at a counter with a sullen Charles. Donny arrives with a developed film envelope, handing Charles his change. Charles leaves, followed by Joe, who trails him as they cycle off. The camera booms up along a water tower as they ride, revealing a mysterious cube attached to its side, unnoticed from the street below. The duo eventually reaches Charles' home, where an exasperated Charles enters, with Joe close behind.\n\nInside, Charles loads the film into a projector. The image of Alice, from the night of a train crash, appears on a poster board mounted on a closet. The filmed scene unfolds, accompanied by an argument between Joe and Charles. They watch the sudden, fleeting depiction of the train crash, the camera capturing little before it falls and records the settling debris.\n\nAs the film continues, Charles steps forward, part of the projection now casting on him. Joe follows suit, also enveloped by the projected images. Amidst the viewing, Joe notices something odd on the screen. He slaps Charles' arm to get his attention, their eyes fixated on the footage. Through the wreckage of the train car, they see something enormous and bizarre, its legs visible momentarily before moving out of frame.\n\nOutside, the wail of an air raid siren escalates, echoing ominously through the town.",
    "1346": "In the quiet neighborhood, two boys exchange fearful glances. Suddenly, they hastily rewind a film and tear it apart. From a distance, military trucks, jeeps, and buses roll into view, disrupting the peace. Neighbors emerge from their homes, bewildered and chattering, as more vehicles appear. As the camera sweeps down to focus on Joe and Charles, they struggle to comprehend the unfolding chaos. Joe calls out to a passing adult, Mr. Harkin, who points toward the horizon. The camera pans to reveal the distant scene.\n\nMilitary buses come to a halt, and soldiers efficiently direct and assist people onto the vehicles, who carry as many of their belongings as possible. Others hurriedly load cars, securing items to the roofs. Amid the confusion, some residents run frantically, searching for missing loved ones. Orders are shouted amidst the residents' complaints and arguments. The air crackles with walkie-talkie squawks and PA announcements as soldiers check their wristbands. Joe passes by a man arguing heatedly with a soldier. So far, about a thousand people have been mobilized.\n\nIn the triage unit, equipped with fifty hospital beds, Louis lies on a cot, his head bandaged, eyes open and muttering to himself. His demeanor reflects exhaustion, a hangover, injury, and shock. Joe, desperately searching for his father, finally spots Louis and rushes over. Louis, in a sudden move, grabs Joe's shirt and pulls him close. With a voice full of desperation and heartache, Louis speaks. Joe, overwhelmed by the information, whispers in response, his mind ablaze with thoughts. Louis looks at him with a glimmer of hope. The others around them watch Joe with a look of disbelief, as if he's from another planet.\n\nMeanwhile, Jen, Charles' attractive sister, lies on her cot, flipping through her Columbia House Records catalog. Charles confronts her intensely. Jen, sensing something off, snaps her magazine shut and stares at him suspiciously. She then looks directly at the camera, her expression a mix of vulnerability and seduction. The scene shifts to Donny, who also stares directly at the camera, utterly stunned. As Donny navigates through parked cars, Joe, Charles, Cary, and Martin follow closely behind. They duck out of sight as soldiers pass by.\n\nIn a small, windowless, tiled room, Jack, exhausted and frustrated yet bored with his frustration, pounds on the door. He pounds again until finally, the door unlocks and opens to reveal a 32-year-old, humorless, armed soldier. Jack is escorted down a dilapidated, narrow hallway with a soldier aiming a semi-automatic at his back. As they pass an open door, Jack catches a glimpse of an empty office; through its window, a few military vehicles and airmen are visible on the tarmac. Jack's thoughts race as he nears the bathroom at the hall's end. Suddenly, he turns and violently slams the soldier to the ground, kneeling over him. The camera pushes in close on Jack, his eyes wide, his mind racing with the question: What the hell next?",
    "1349": "As the boys gather their courage amidst hauntingly flashing lights, Joe approaches a locked bulletproof glass door, attempting in vain to open it. On the opposite side, Nelec, disoriented and breathing heavily, tries the handle of the same glass barrier that separates him from the kids, but it remains firmly shut. Joe and Nelec find themselves face-to-face through the glass, with Joe recognizing the fear and resignation in Nelec's eyes, understanding this as Nelec's fate. In a poignant moment, Nelec looks into Joe's eyes, silently conveying his repentance.\n\nSuddenly, Joe realizes he is about to witness Nelec's end. The creature forcefully breaks through the bus door, enlarging the opening to enter. Joe and the creature strike at the glass simultaneously as Nelec exhausts his ammunition. With another hit from Joe, the window shatters, sending glass shards raining down on the boys who shield their faces, with Cary catching a glimpse of the creature.\n\nWith help from the other boys, Joe manages to climb outside the bus. Peering out, he spots the creature, just fifteen feet away and focused on the door. Joe struggles to pull himself onto the top of the bus as the creature charges terrifyingly down the aisle towards him. In the tense silence before the creature's final lunge, Nelec whispers, terror evident in his voice.\n\nMeanwhile, Louis, struggling to stand due to his injured legs, receives unexpected help from Jack, who assumes the role of a supportive Air Force member. As the two soldiers depart, Jack assists Louis by draping his arm over his shoulders and leads him away, leaving Louis confused yet hopeful.\n\nMoments later, Joe retrieves his mother's necklace from Overmyer's lifeless body. Cary displays his backpack as they notice an approaching car. As it arrives, it's revealed to be Donny, who steps out, his eyes wild and red, yet overjoyed to see them. He looks at Joe with a pained expression. Soon after, Joe drives with Donny asleep beside him, and other boys in the back.\n\nJoe suddenly turns the car into a driveway, but more tanks and military vehicles appear from the direction they came. Joe's eyes widen in alarm as they find themselves trapped amidst continuous gunfire. Quickly, Joe and the boys abandon the car and dash across the street, weaving between the looming military vehicles to escape.",
    "1356": "Alice, visibly anxious, shakes her head while driving, her nerves evident in the motion. Later, a sense of relief or at least gratitude toward Joe washes over her as she nods in acknowledgment. Together, they share a moment of silent contemplation, their gazes fixed ahead in a long, drawn-out stare.\n\nThe camera cranes down to capture a Buick arriving on scene, and from it, dusty boys emerge. They exchange looks, a silent communication passing between them. Charles, among them, shares a moment with Joe, lifting a broken camera mounted on a tripod. Joe responds with a nod, affirming something unspoken between them.\n\nIn the car, Alice discovers an object on the passenger seat and extends it towards Joe as he approaches the window. She presents it more clearly: it's THE CUBE. Joe accepts it, taking the cube with him as he enters the house through the front door.\n\nInside, Joe moves toward the living room where Charles sits engrossed by a television report of a train crash. The footage shows a helicopter view of the wreckage, and both Joe and Charles watch, stunned by the disaster unfolding before them. The camera focuses on Charles, capturing his shift from despair to a deep contemplation.\n\nLater, Joe and Charles cycle into town, their journey taking them across a bridge with a massive steel mill looming in the background. The camera tilts down from the town's water tower as they pass beneath it and cross Main Street. Two military trucks rumble past, and an airman in one of them scans the area with a handheld device.\n\nCharles, back at home, opens the camera and removes the film inside. His reaction reveals his inexperience with smoking, something he's never done before. The setting is a modest, lower-middle-class home nestled against a wooded area.\n\nJoe meets Alice at her front door, her demeanor uneasy. From the car nearby, Louis emerges, carrying a small grocery bag. This is the same man who was arrested at Joe's mother's wake. As he spots Joe, Louis's expression darkens with hostility, yet he struggles to meet Joe's eyes. Louis reenters the house, followed by Alice who turns back to Joe with a conflicted look before quietly closing the door. Left alone, Joe finds a moment of happiness amidst the tension.\n\nSuddenly, the peace is shattered by loud pops: BAM! BAM! BAM! BAM! In a dramatic scene, Martin, disguised as Detective Hathaway, fires his gun at Cary, who is dressed in a soiled suit and turning into a zombie. His eyes are wide and glossy white. As bullets strike him, Cary clutches his chest in agony, blood spurting out as he collapses to the ground in pain.\n\nBehind the camera, Charles yells out, directing the scene. The camera then pulls back to reveal a wider shot past six bicycles tossed haphazardly on the ground. Charles, Joe, and Preston are positioned with Joe's dad's Kodak camera on a tripod, surrounded by their scattered filming equipment. The scene extends to include Martin and Alice, who were being filmed. In the distance, the train crash's aftermath stretches across the valley, an endless reminder of the day's chaos.",
    "1359": "As the movie unfolds, a series of tense and emotional scenes capture the escalating drama. Initially, a disturbing sight catches her attention as Jack's cruiser arrives on the scene. Inside, Overmyer approaches Nelec, who is already engrossed in reviewing a folder. Suddenly, Nelec's attention shifts to something unsettling outside: the kids.\n\nThe tension escalates when Joe, caught off guard, spins around just as Jack arrives. Jack snatches his camera from Charles and confronts Joe with firm resolve. The confrontation leaves Joe stunned and deeply humiliated in front of Alice. Jack then opens the back door of the squad car, ushering Joe inside before slamming it shut. With a forceful motion, Jack throws the camera and tripod onto the passenger seat, slams that door as well, and heads toward the house, leaving Joe confined in the back of the car.\n\nAs Joe's breathing grows heavy and his heart pounds, he watches from the car as his father approaches Nelec. Alice watches Joe with sympathetic eyes. Meanwhile, the door opens to admit Jack, who then steps aside to let Joe pass. Joe, closing the door with force, expresses his anger, though it is restrained. As Jack turns to leave, Joe, fueled by rage, confronts him. Jack, taken aback and stunned, finds himself close to Joe, his intensity palpable and intimidating. Joe steps back, his heart racing. In a sudden moment of clarity, Jack halts, realizing the gravity of his words and the person to whom he is speaking. Despite his realization, Jack finds himself unable to transcend his role as a law officer in favor of being a better father. More upset with himself than with Joe, he exits the scene.\n\nJoe's journey continues as he rides up a hill, leading to the revelation of the town cemetery. There, he sits with his back against his mother's grave, holding her open locket and staring at it intensely. Suddenly, a deep, low sound in the distance grabs his attention. Joe, motionless at first, stands and pulls out his flashlight, directing its beam down the rows of graves toward the distant caretaker's shed. Another intense, low sound is followed by a high-pitched hit, reminiscent of metal striking wood, causing Joe to back up nervously. More odd sounds follow, each transitioning the narrative forward.\n\nMeanwhile, Jack arrives at an abandoned airfield in his squad car. As he steps out, the headlights of three large military trucks suddenly switch on, blinding him as he struggles to see. The scene shifts to a medical setting, where Jack stands past an IV and medical machinery, looking at someone not yet revealed to the audience. Overmyer watches quietly in the background, while Nelec remains calm and simple. The identity of the person Jack is looking at is finally revealed: battered and scraped, lying in a medical bed, he is afraid yet defiant. Dr. Woodward, sensing his time on Earth drawing to a close, swallows hard. By the door, Overmyer silently dons his black gloves, and Nelec offers a vague, searching smile.",
    "1362": "Mike exits the stage door and proceeds down the alley, trailed by a bewildered camera crew. Inside the control room, Abby watches in horror as the phones incessantly ring. Overwhelmed, Abby sighs in defeat and grabs the microphone connected to Mike's earpiece. On the monitor, Mike appears slightly puzzled yet proceeds to lift a girl's finger and lick off the Jello.\n\nAs Mike waves to the camera, he is suddenly pulled into a Jello pool where enthusiastic girls tear off his shirt. Covered in Jello, Mike enters the room to find Abby standing with her arms crossed, silently seething. Abby then turns and walks away, leaving Mike confused. He follows her.\n\nIn a serious mood, Stuart wears a grave expression. Abby nods, visibly uncomfortable. Cardboard suns and clouds strategically placed, cover her bosom. Abby covers a cat's eyes and looks away, but soon she peeks back through the window to see Colin stepping out of the shower. As Colin starts flossing, wearing only a towel, Abby leans in for a closer look and freezes.\n\nMike approaches them, but Abby turns and walks off again. Abby enters her office, followed by Mike. In a white doctor's jacket, Colin talks on the phone and goes over patient files. Mike picks up the extension to listen in. Abby glares at him but is unable to stop him. As the phone rings, Abby looks concerned, contemplates, and then answers it. Colin, confused, continues his phone conversation. Abby hesitates, followed by a long pause, until Mike hangs up the phone and hustles her out of the room.\n\nNight falls on the condo complex. Abby enters, stunning in a little black dress and sling backs. She grabs his ass and shifts into seductress mode, tracing her finger up and down his arm. She leans in seductively, gives him a look, and moves even closer. Suddenly, he shoves her away. Mike leaps over the couch and hides as Abby walks over to the door and opens it to find Colin standing there. She quickly hustles him out the door.\n\nRealizing she's spoken aloud, Abby blanches and waits for Mike's instructions. She grabs a napkin and begins rubbing his khakis. The Jumbotron camera captures a man catching a fly and then shifts focus to Abby and Colin. The camera pans over to them, making it appear as though Abby is enthusiastically giving Colin a hand job. The entire stadium, including the ballplayers, stop and stare in disbelief.\n\nColin waves and walks toward his condo. Abby pretends to enter her house, watching until Colin closes his front door. She then turns and rushes over to Mike, throwing her arms around him in an embrace. Mike pulls back, slightly uncomfortable.",
    "1363": "Abby, with a playful roll of her eyes and a smile, steps inside. Meanwhile, Mike, as he walks away, briefly turns back before continuing on his path. Abby then looks away with a haughty air. She settles onto the couch, her gaze fixed on a box labeled ELECTRIC. Curiosity piqued, she opens the box, revealing a pair of underwear and a REMOTE CONTROL, which she empties onto the couch.\n\nAbby checks her reflection in the mirror before joining Mike and Colin as they enter a bar. Immediately, two voluptuous blonde twins, JELLO GIRLS named Bambi and Candi, rush over to Mike, playfully slapping him on the back while eyeing the twins. The group then takes a seat at a table. In a playful attempt to kick Mike, Abby inadvertently knocks over her purse. Its contents scatter, and the REMOTE for her vibrating underwear rolls under the table.\n\nNearby, an 8-year-old PRECOCIOUS KID sits with his parents as a small RED LIGHT on the remote activates. Amidst the laughter of Harold and Bob, Stuart also gives Mike a hearty slap on the back. Abby's smile suddenly turns to horror as she feels the underwear start to vibrate. She shifts uncomfortably in her seat, attempting to control the now-vibrating device, then leans down to grab her purse. Peeking under the table, she sees the spilled contents of her purse, and Mike's head soon joins hers, leading him to burst into laughter.\n\nStuart watches, worry etched across his face, as Abby emerges from under the table, clutching her head and frantically scanning the room to identify who holds the remote. The kid, mischievously, increases the speed on the remote. Abby's eyes roll back in response. As she attempts to stand, Stuart stops her. Candi, intrigued by Abby's reaction, looks towards Harold. Stuart's frown deepens with concern as Abby experiences a spasm before rushing to get up as quickly as possible.\n\nLeaping to her feet, Abby and the group eventually leave the bar. Mike snatches the remote from the kid, but Abby quickly spots this and reclaims it from Mike, shooting him a pointed look. Colin approaches as they all exit. On a film set, Mike addresses the camera, while nearby, a confused Joy observes Abby. Georgia winks at Mike, and Abby, confused, looks at an agent. As a CAB DRIVER eyes her, Abby steps out of a cab with a suitcase in hand, meeting Mike as he exits the lobby. Abby glares at him, her true feelings momentarily surfacing before she quickly masks them.\n\nSitting in the backseat of a car with Mike, Abby reviews her notes, feeling his gaze upon her. She sits, simmering with frustration at his accuracy. Mike looks at her, surprise flickering across his face. Later, as Mike takes a deep breath and walks on stage amidst the audience's applause, Abby watches from the audience as Jay interviews Mike. Meanwhile, Abby converses on the phone, her expression shifting from surprise to suspicion. A waiter arrives, serving mojitos, and Abby, sipping hers, continues to study Mike.",
    "1364": "Mike, feeling the weight of the moment, decides to be honest with Abby. As he stands to emphasize his sincerity, a waitress approaches their table. Meanwhile, Abby gazes at the dance floor, marveling at how even the clumsiest dancers seem skilled. Seizing the moment, Mike takes Abby's hand and confidently leads her to join the crowd on the dance floor. They move through the throng of dancers, and soon, they share a prolonged kiss, deepening their connection.\n\nUnexpectedly, Mike dashes out of an elevator but swiftly returns to pull Abby towards him. In a flash, their passion ignites, and they find themselves intensely intertwined. Amidst their fervor, the elevator doors attempt to close, but their energetic groping keeps them ajar until a jarring buzzer sounds. Startled, they pull apart and look at each other in shock. Mike, appearing shell-shocked, backs away from the elevator as the doors finally shut. Abby, flushed and stunned by the encounter, retreats to her room and collapses onto her bed, her face mirroring the same expression of disbelief.\n\nRegaining her composure, Abby quickly rises, fixes her hair, checks her reflection, and moves to answer a knock at her door. She opens it with a welcoming smile to find Colin standing there, a bottle of red wine in hand. Colin enters the room, showcasing the wine with a confident gesture. At the same moment, Mike approaches Abby's door but is thrown off by the sight of Colin. Abby appears from behind Colin, and after a brief acknowledgment, Mike turns and leaves, visibly perturbed. As Mike walks down the hallway, increasingly unsettled, Abby runs to catch up with him. He continues his stride, with Abby struggling to match his pace until he stops and locks eyes with her for a prolonged, intense moment. Breaking the gaze, Mike looks away, shrugs dismissively, and walks off, leaving Abby behind.\n\nAbby reenters her room where Colin, still shirtless, offers her a glass of wine. She drinks, and keeps drinking until she finishes the glass, her eyes meeting Colin's. A pleased smile graces Abby's face momentarily before fading. She nods at Colin, her expression shifting as she surveys her surroundings, emotions of hurt and shock surfacing within her, quickly morphing into a fierce, abiding hatred.\n\nLater, Abby and Joy navigate through a waiting area crowded with diverse hopefuls vying to replace Mike Alexander. Abby points out candidates as Joy diligently notes their details on a clipboard, occasionally glancing at Abby with concern. Meanwhile, in the control room, Stuart and Cliff monitor the events, seated beside each other.\n\nOn a television screen, Jack Magnum delivers his introduction from inside a balloon basket at the Balloon Fiesta. Mike, watching the live broadcast, sees Jack continue to alienate his audience. Suddenly, Jack is tackled and pushed out of the basket. After a tense moment, Abby, looking frazzled yet driven by adrenaline, takes his place in the basket. Stuart and Cliff, watching from the control room, are visibly shocked by the unfolding events. Reacting swiftly, Mike, after staring at Abby on the TV for a second, grabs his keys and races out, with Jonah calling after him in the background.",
    "1366": "Pete is seated on the toilet, engrossed in a game of Scrabble on his iPad. Suddenly, a woman snatches the device from him and strides away in a huff. Later, Pete takes the stage, addressing a modest gathering. Amidst applause, Graham Parker, a man in his sixties, energetically leaps onto the stage. Pete and Debbie then witness Graham deliver a profoundly moving performance, though Debbie's mood remains unaffected by the music, which, despite its quality, strikes her as somewhat melancholy and fails to captivate her. Soon, she succumbs to boredom.\n\nAs the evening winds down, Pete and Debbie drive home, their journey briefly interrupted by the wail of an ambulance's sirens. Upon arriving home, they continue an ongoing dispute as they enter. Inside, Sadie is immersed in a song playing on her iPhone. The atmosphere shifts as everyone bursts into laughter, dances wildly, and revels in the moment, only for Pete to abruptly turn off the iPod. He then playfully dances as if thoroughly enjoying himself before halting the music himself.\n\nThe next morning, Pete joins his children at the breakfast table, eating together. Around them, Debbie busily prepares the children for school. Amidst the morning rush, Charlotte dashes towards her room, and Sadie lets out a scream, prompting Debbie to quickly cover Sadie's mouth. As they prepare to leave, another parent, Beth, accompanied by her charming child, approaches them. Beth and her child, Katie, then depart. Just as they enter the classroom, the teacher pulls Debbie aside for a private conversation and walks away before Debbie can respond. Frustrated, Debbie lights a cigarette as she drives away from the school.\n\nAt his office, Pete is seen pacing while on a phone call. He then joins Ronnie and Cat, employees at his record label, to review an electronic press kit featuring Graham Parker. The kit includes a montage showcasing Graham's performances from the seventies up to the present day. During this viewing, Graham is interviewed by a journalist wearing a yarmulke. After the presentation, Graham approaches Pete, Cat, and Ronnie.\n\nBack at home, Pete and Debbie engage in conversation. Debbie holds a document listing changes she wishes to implement. As they talk, Pete picks up a guitar and begins to play. Later, in bed, Debbie works on a laptop, revealing that she is watching security camera footage of a store. The footage shows Desi's boyfriend entering and sitting behind the counter. Desi joins him, adjusting her position on his lap, and they share a kiss. On the screen, Desi appears to move up and down slightly.\n\nThe tension breaks when Pete lets out a fart, followed by another, this time longer. Debbie reacts by hitting him with a pillow, but the farts continue. In another part of the house, Charlotte energetically jumps in front of Sadie's door. Inside her room, Sadie sits quietly on her bed, focused on her homework. Charlotte, in a playful mood, grabs her head as if being dragged away and then mimics playing an air guitar.\n\nIn the kitchen, Pete discards a packet of M&M's into the trash. He then throws away all his cupcakes but one. He takes a bite, attempts to discard it but hesitates, takes another bite, holds it over the trash, takes one last bite, and finally disposes of the remaining piece. The scene shifts to Pete running on a treadmill, undergoing an electrocardiogram.",
    "1369": "Pete removes a framed item from his wall and takes it to Larry's house. Upon arriving, Pete, holding a drawing framed and signed by John Lennon, hands it to Larry who had just answered the door. Meanwhile, at a school, Sadie and several other children are busy constructing sets for their school play. During this time, Sadie engages in a conversation with a friend. Watching from a distance, Pete and Debbie sit side by side as Debbie attempts to break some news to him gently, though she becomes visibly disheartened.\n\nUpset, Debbie walks through the campus and spots a kid, darting towards him. The kid, Joseph, who is thirteen and had previously insulted Sadie on her social media, turns to face Debbie. Her demeanor grows quieter yet more intimidating as she confronts him, causing Joseph to look distressed before she storms off. Later, Debbie barges into a bathroom where Pete sits on the toilet, occupied with his iPad. She leaves, and Pete gives her the finger after she's gone.\n\nDebbie and Desi, chatting as they descend into a lively club, eventually join a conversation with a group of young, professional-looking men. One of them removes a plate of teeth, which Desi then tries to fit into her own mouth, sparking laughter among everyone. She appears wild and attempts to kiss Debbie amidst the ongoing amusement before returning the teeth to their owner, who reinserts them, prompting cheers from the crowd.\n\nAt a half-filled nightclub, Pete watches Graham Parker and his band perform an incredible song that resonates deeply with the issues he's facing. Billie Joe Armstrong, seated nearby, also watches the performance. Elsewhere, Debbie and Desi dance with hockey players to a Nikki Minaj song, with Debbie thoroughly enjoying herself and laughing with a cute, twenty-four-year-old hockey player named Jay.\n\nAs the night winds down, Graham Parker packs up to leave, and Pete approaches him. Billie Joe comes over to congratulate Graham before they walk away together, leaving Pete to sit alone in his car, crying. Debbie, meanwhile, drops Desi off at her apartment, her expression one of shock as Desi simply nods.\n\nBack at home, Pete lies in bed using his iPad when Debbie enters to talk. Her shirt is unbuttoned, revealing she's topless, and she exits into the bathroom. There's a silence before she returns, now dressed, and Pete walks out of the room with Debbie following behind.\n\nIn her room, Charlotte plays the piano alone, overhearing Debbie and Pete arguing through the wall. Debbie begins to walk away. Tension fills the air as they all lay in bed watching 'Spongebob Squarepants'. Charlotte, in a seemingly childish act, starts licking her fingers, doing it more persistently, and then pokes Sadie with her wet fingers, leading Sadie to leave the room and slam her door. Charlotte also leaves, later sitting at her desk to write a note which she places on Sadie's door.\n\nFinally, Pete sits alone, listening to music, reflecting on the events of the day.",
    "1372": "He departs his residence, moving towards a source of light. An elderly man, clutching a flaming torch, approaches the same dwelling. Upon reaching it, the old man swings open the front door to reveal an interior engulfed in darkness. He then ascends the staircase, where the air is filled with faint whispers and muted conversations from above. Stationing himself outside the room where these voices originate, the old man eavesdrops intently. Unbeknownst to him, a serpent stealthily slinks past and into the room. Wormtail appears in the doorway, fixing a gaze upon the elderly figure, who in turn looks utterly terrified. Suddenly, a powerful spell echoes, jolting Harry awake in a state of panic; his agitation persists as he struggles to regain composure.\n\nHermione approaches Ron's bedside, and they exchange a handshake before ascending a hill together. The camera focuses on a solitary boot perched atop the hill, around which a group gathers, each placing a hand upon it. Harry hastens to join them, laying his hand on the boot. Instantly, a blinding flash envelops them, and they are catapulted through the sky. Cheers erupt as Harry, Hermione, and the young Weasleys land with a jarring thud, while Arthur, Amos, and Cedric descend with more finesse. Cedric assists Harry to his feet, and they proceed across a field where a vast, exuberant crowd and numerous tents await. They immerse themselves in the throng, eventually approaching a modest tent. Amos and Cedric diverge and depart, leaving the others to enter the tent, which astonishingly is far larger inside than out. Inside, they quickly remove their feet from a table and replace them once Arthur has passed by.\n\nThe camera shifts upwards along the hillside to reveal a colossal stadium, boasting countless tiers. Harry and the Weasleys navigate to their seats, from where they observe Lucius and Draco Malfoy passing below. The event commences with balloons ascending and fireworks erupting, setting the stage for aerial acrobatics by five green and white figures, trailing vibrant colors. A dazzling leprechaun materializes in the sky, enchanting the crowd with its dance. The excitement escalates as five red figures take to the air, one daringly executing a stunt. One performer's image magnifies on a giant screen, and Viktor Krum acknowledges the audience with a wave, joined by Harry in the celebration.\n\nPanic ensues as the crowd scatters chaotically, resulting in Harry being trampled into unconsciousness. Once the masses disperse, a lone man wanders through the debris, kicking at objects. He conjures a spell, unleashing a brilliant flash from which emerges a ghostly skull in the heavens, a snake issuing from its mouth. His face contorts into a sinister grin, reflecting his deranged state. Harry regains consciousness to find this man before him and flees in terror. Together with others, they gaze upward at the terrifying apparition; Harry, overwhelmed, clutches his head in agony.",
    "1376": "Ron gasps audibly as Hermione storms away in frustration. Meanwhile, Harry ascends a staircase, only to collide with Cho who emerges unexpectedly from around the corner. Back in another room, Ron, appearing shaky, receives assistance entering; he shakes his head in dismay. The Patil twins pass by nonchalantly as Ron, standing before a mirror, dons his comical dress robes, looking both panicked and uncomfortable. Harry enters, clad in a more traditional suit, and sniffs at his attire.\n\nTogether, Harry and Ron descend the stairs into the hall, with Ron constantly adjusting his outfit. They approach the Patil twins, who glance at Ron. Hermione, looking radiant, enters the room and then gracefully descends the stairs. Viktor Krum takes her hand, and they walk together to the dance floor, where they soon start dancing. The celebration grows as others join in, including Dumbledore and McGonagall, Mr. Filch with his cat, and Hagrid paired with Madame Maxime. Mad-Eye Moody watches from the sidelines, sipping his drink, while the crowd's enthusiasm visibly rises. Amidst this, Harry, Ron, and their dates sit at a distance, clearly unhappy. After enjoying her time with Viktor, Hermione approaches, only to leave shortly after. Harry, still seated, rises to leave, and he and Ron walk away together.\n\nThe scene shifts to an old house where a sleeve is rolled up, revealing a tattoo of a skull and snake on an arm. Suddenly, Harry awakens in his bed, disturbed by the creaking floorboards as someone approaches. The intruder chuckles and dances away, leaving Harry to nod in acknowledgment before he starts undressing to take a bath, with his golden egg resting nearby. The ghostly figure of little Myrtle flies around, soon diving into the water. Harry, following suit, submerges the egg underwater and joins it, feeling embarrassed as Myrtle laughs. Mad-Eye Moody appears suddenly in the doorway, while Neville emerges from behind a bookcase. The Weasley twins, meanwhile, are loudly taking bets.\n\nHarry walks with Neville, clutching some green gilliweed, which he puts into his mouth, only to start choking. The cannon fires, signaling the start of the competition, and the champions enter the water; three dive in while Harry is pushed. Underwater, the gilliweed's effects transform Harry's hands and feet into webbed appendages. Propelled like a dolphin, Harry soars into the air, eliciting cheers from the crowd. He swims through the underwater world, navigating among fish and rocks, still searching diligently. Eventually, he discovers Ron, Hermione, Cho Chang, and a blonde girl from Beauxbatons, all bound by their ankles. Cedric, also present, takes Cho and departs. Harry begins freeing Ron and Hermione but is confronted by aggressive merpeople. A figure resembling a shark races towards them at high speed; it turns out to be Viktor, who grabs Hermione and ascends to the surface.",
    "1380": "In the tense atmosphere of a dimly lit room, Black emits a howl, followed by a bitter amusement. Lupin, observing him, turns away momentarily before locking eyes with Black again and giving a nod of acknowledgment. Suddenly, wands are forcibly ejected from their owners' hands, clattering to the floor. The group's attention shifts as they notice Snape, standing smugly in the doorway. As Black advances towards him, Snape menacingly positions his wand at Black's neck, his gaze hardening. With a gesture towards the door, he indicates for them to leave.\n\nAs the group begins to exit, Harry's gaze catches on the table where Lupin had inadvertently left his wand. In a swift motion, Harry retrieves it. The room erupts into action as Snape is propelled into the air, crashing against the wall with a thud before sliding down. Ron and Hermione, witnessing the scene, are frozen in shock, as is Harry, who quickly regains his composure and turns to face Black. As Harry points at him, Black responds with a mirthless laugh, then shifts his focus to Ron, whose face drains of color in terror. Scabbers, in Ron's arms, begins to squirm violently. Both Lupin and Black turn their attention to Ron, who clutches Scabbers protectively. A silent exchange passes between Sirius and Lupin, their eyes conveying a mutual understanding.\n\nPettigrew, his small, watery eyes darting nervously between the windows and door, makes a sudden dash for freedom, only to be effortlessly pushed back by Sirius. His nose twitches as his gaze locks onto Harry, his hands fluttering nervously and revealing a missing index finger. Emerging from a gap, Pettigrew starts to babble desperately. Harry briefly assesses Pettigrew before looking away, his attention caught by Hermione, who is staring intently at the full moon. His own eyes shift to Lupin, now a rigid silhouette with twitching fingers, shaking his head. Pettigrew, constantly scanning the room, notices the wand trembling in Lupin's lengthening fist. As the wand drops from Lupin's hand, Pettigrew seizes the opportunity to leap forward.\n\nHarry gazes into Pettigrew's glassy eyes, the moment disrupted as his Patronus briefly blooms and fades. Harry's vision blurs with the swirling presence of Dementors drawing closer. Black gasps, silvery feathers of light tumbling from his lips as if his soul were escaping. Then, a burst of light shatters the darkness through the trees. Squinting, Harry sees a fiery stag, its body luminous, charging through the forest, spreading light into the darkness. The remaining Dementors scatter, their forms drifting across the moon like ash.\n\nAs the light begins to fade, the stag's luminous form flickers before a bright flash plunges everything back into darkness, leaving only a single thread of light, which spirals down to the size of a pearl in the palm of a man standing deep within the trees. Harry studies this strangely familiar silhouette until it vanishes. The scene shifts to a hospital wing where Hermione emerges from the shadow cast by a curtain around Harry's bed. Opposite him, Ron lies with a bandaged leg, while Hermione paces restlessly before stopping. Dumbledore enters, handing both Harry and Hermione a stick of chocolate before starting to leave, pausing briefly to smile and then exiting. Harry looks curiously at the chocolate, but Hermione, preoccupied, does not respond. Instead, she takes the long chain of a pendant and loops it around both her and Harry's necks.",
    "1388": "Disguised with Hermione's scarf and Ron's hat, Harry attempts to blend in. Fudge, appearing anxious, gestures toward the pub with a quick nod of his head. He ushers Rosmerta and McGonagall inside, while the scene shifts back to Hermione and Ron. Fresh footprints lead through the snow into the pub. Briefly, Ron and Hermione are seen passing a frosted window. Suddenly, three shrunken heads swing into view. Inside, Rosmerta glances at McGonagall, who responds with a grim nod. With a loud blast, the pub doors burst open, revealing Ron and Hermione waiting on Main Street, warming their hands against the cold. As they look down, the camera tilts and new footprints materialize in the snow. The perspective shifts away from Harry's point of view.\n\nAt the end of a rocky outcrop, the footprints stop and sobs echo softly. Ron, attempting to hold Hermione back, fails as she follows the prints, filling them with her own steps. Kneeling, she carefully removes the cloak from Harry, who gazes into the mist, his eyes filled with tears. Meanwhile, butterflies dance over the expansive green lawn, and the Giant Squid shatters the last layer of ice on the Black Lake. The Whomping Willow shakes off water from its branches. Inside, the dying sun casts an intense amber-red glow on Harry's face as he faces Lupin. Ancient charts adorn the walls, and spheres of spun glass silently orbit around each other. Lupin paces in front of a large trunk, and as Harry's attention drifts, Lupin snaps his fingers to refocus him. Harry shakes his head, then nods. With a sharp crack, a Dementor transforms into a silvery white orb. Harry glances at the blood-red sun through the window, then looks into Lupin's eyes, emotionally nodding and taking a deep breath. Lupin, moved by Harry's quiet intensity, blinks and opens a packing case, causing the Dementor to reappear. Harry's hair brushes against his scar, and though his hand and body tremble, he stands firm. A whooshing sound fills the air as a massive silver shadow bursts from his wand, hovering between him and the Dementor, causing it to falter. Lupin nods in approval.\n\nLater, all the boys are asleep except for Harry, who lies in bed, gazing at a photograph of his parents, faintly lit by a flickering candle. The camera begins to move forward, revealing only an old man in a painting, scowling under the light of Harry's wand. As Harry prepares to follow, he hesitates. The light from his wand dances across a parchment until it settles on another dot. Harry quickly stashes the map, extinguishes his wand, and turns, only to face the harsh glare of Snape's wand. A sneer forms at the corners of Snape's lips as he eyes Harry coldly, lowering his wand. His eyes glitter upon seeing the map, and to Harry's horror, words start to appear on it. Snape studies Harry with a sadistic half-smile on his lips.",
    "1390": "The trio, overcome with emotion, struggles to hold back their tears. Suddenly, a quartet of bleak shadows emerges from the hut, one of them, Dumbledore, raises his hand and directs the group's attention away from Buckbeak. Dumbledore speaks briefly, though his words are lost at a distance, and then the sound of crows shrieking fills the air. The executioner separates from the group and vanishes behind a low stand of trees. Sunlight glints off the axe as it rises above the treetops, hanging momentarily against the sky before disappearing from view. A sickening chop echoes through the air, leaving Ron and Harry in numb disbelief as they stare towards the trees. Hermione, her face turned away, trembles. Slowly, she places her hand on Ron's shoulder, and the camera follows down his arm to a drop of blood that falls from his finger like a tear. Ron fixates on his hand and the blood trickling down his finger before his gaze shifts to see Scabbers racing away. Ron chases after Scabbers, with Harry and Hermione following closely behind. Ron reaches the summit and disappears over the top, followed by Hermione and Harry who soon reach the ridge and stop. Ron catches Scabbers, cradling him in his bloodied palm, then turns to look at Harry. In the gathering gloom, an enormous, pale-eyed, jet-black dog bounds toward them. Harry shields himself as the dog leaps over him and vanishes into a gap at the base of a tree, dragging Ron through. Harry and Hermione navigate a primitive passageway, ducking under dangling roots, until the tunnel abruptly ends. Confused, they look around and then up to see a small opening. Harry reaches up and pulls himself through, then helps Hermione up. They survey the area, noting stains on the floorboards that resemble dried blood and shattered furniture scattered about. The ceiling creaks, prompting them to rush to the stairs. Emerging at the top, they look down to see a wide, shiny stripe cutting through the dust-laden floor, leading to a door from which light seeps. Harry follows paw prints on the floor to a pair of filthy human feet, then slowly raises his eyes to a man standing in the shadows, with filthy, matted hair hanging to his shoulders and skin resembling that of a corpse. The man studies Harry's face intently. Harry draws his wand, his hand shaking as he faces the man, identified as Black. The two lock eyes, the moment charged with tension, until Lupin steps forward and embraces Black warmly. Harry and Ron watch, completely taken aback, as Lupin greets Black like a brother.",
    "1002": "Gatsby surveys the scene. Gatsby stands, resting on a cane. He looks at the clock on the mantelpiece, then at his watch. The clock has a robust, angular dark wood surround. Gatsby paces. He undoes a button on his white jacket and sits, frowning. Nick sits, looking quite relaxed. Gatsby freezes and breathes tensely. Nick goes to look out of the window. A car comes up the drive. Nick hurries outside, holding an umbrella. Grey-faced, Gatsby sits with a newspaper. The driver puts down a rug and Daisy steps out of the car onto it. She wears blue and gold shoes, a flouncy purple and pale blue dress with frills, and a hat to match. Daisy walks in and checks her immaculately bobbed blonde hair in a mirror. She looks into the room full of flowers. Nick waits in the hall as Daisy walks into the room amazed. Nick looks unsure. Nick walks into the room to find Daisy admiring the orchids. Confused, he looks to the chair and the window. The French windows are ajar. Nick smiles at Daisy who hands him her hat. Nick goes to the front door and finds Gatsby outside, soaked through. With a steely-eyed, determined look, Gatsby marches into the cottage. He stops in the hall and smooths back his hair. He walks into the flower-filled room and stops for a moment to look at Daisy. She turns sharply and sees him. They gaze at each other across the room. Daisy's chest heaves as she breathes deeply. Her eyes appear glazed. She looks entranced. Gatsby steps forward and regards her with an earnest expression. Nick watches from the hall, wide-eyed. Daisy continues to gaze at Gatsby, dewy-eyed. He nods slightly. They both nod slightly. Later, the kettle boils. Nick carries a tray with a shiny silver tea set on it into the room. As he pours tea, Daisy sits on a couch and Gatsby stands leaning against the mantelpiece where the wooden clock sits. Nick finishes pouring tea through a strainer. He and Daisy exchange furtive and nervous looks. Gatsby steels himself and turns to Daisy, smiling. He knocks the clock off the mantelpiece and it breaks. He tries to push the bit that broke off back in place. With a final bash, he gives up and sits across the coffee table from Daisy. Gatsby rests his chin on his hand. Nick stands between Gatsby and Daisy. Nick hands them cups of tea and sits on the couch next to Daisy. They all look rather uncomfortable. Nick stares into space. Daisy and Gatsby steal the occasional glance at each other. Nick suddenly springs to his feet. On the porch, Gatsby holds up a hand.",
    "1008": "Others stare ahead dazed and incapable of movement. One man wipes tears from his eyes. Another man approaches the front of Buckingham Palace and places a bouquet of flowers at the gate. More people arrive with bouquets of flowers to place at the railings. Tony and Alistair watch Earl Spencer read a statement on TV. A woman enters. A smiling Alistair puts down the phone. The woman hands Tony another phone. Tony's hand covers the receiver. He waits a moment. Then, raises the phone to speak. As a servant arranges cutlery on a table, Robin enters the dining room.

Striding down a corridor, Charles suddenly stops outside a room. He pauses for a moment before entering. Charles slowly enters the room and a glass door shuts behind him. Charles stands before a casket and waits a moment. He then walks around to the head of the casket. Seen from outside the room, the view of Charles is obscured by the frame of the glass door. A priest can be glimpsed speaking while Charles has his hand over his mouth and looks in grief at the casket before him. Later, Tony sits in the backseat of a car which is driving down a motorway at daytime. Tony hands the phone to his female assistant, then glances out the window.

A boy leaps off a jetty towards a lake and is frozen in midair. The traffic helicopter for a local news program flies over Sacramento, California. Names appear beside the white silhouetted symbols for a woman, then a man. The symbols have red hearts on them. A young woman comes out of her house, talking on her phone. A phone rings. The smart, attractive, blonde woman, Abby, arrives at work at the local TV station, KSXP. A control room. A cooking show on a studio set. Technical director, Cliff, turns to Abby. The chef swigs wine from a bottle. Mary has a swig. Abby's boss, Stuart, switches off his monitors. In the toilet. In a restaurant, Abby sits at a table with the guy. Abby takes out his profile. He looks peeved. Later that night, Abby walks past an illuminated fountain. She heads along a path through the pretty ornamental gardens outside her apartment building. She lets herself in her front door, and her cat, D'Artagnan, trots over. Abby looks thoughtful and a little sad. As she gets ready for bed, a TV plays in her bedroom. D'Artagnan treads on the remote and changes channels. He gobbles a marshmallow on the end of a long skewer. He slurps a coffee. She looks at Mike, haughtily. Grinning, he shakes her hand. Abby paces in her office. She rolls her eyes. On the studio lot. He gets between them. He snogs her. Larry throws Georgia over his shoulder and carries her off. Abby's lying on the floor in her office closet. Frowning, Abby sags. Abby pulls the closet door shut. A girl cycles past a garage apartment on a leafy street. Mike walks into the apartment. He dumps his bag on a chair and presses play on his answer phone. Frowning, he crosses himself. Mike grabs the answer phone. Mike goes next door with his nephew. Mike's sister, Elizabeth, has a cake for him. The upstairs of Abby's apartment has a balcony. Light streams through open French windows. In her bathroom, Abby runs her fingers through her long, blonde hair. The cat's by a broken fishbowl. D'Artagnan trots out of the window. He's up a tree. Abby stands underneath the tree. She climbs. She looks across to a neighboring balcony. The French windows are open. Inside, a handsome, muscular guy is wrapping a towel around his waist. Abby clamps her hand over the cat's snout and ogles the guy. He flosses his teeth, and Abby grins. The branch breaks. She hangs upside down.",

Mike crouches behind the couch. Mike smiles and gives Abby the thumbs-up. Abby does a little victory dance, punching the air. At the baseball game, the pitcher pitches and the batter hits. As Abby and Colin walk to their seats, Mike talks to Abby on an earpiece. He sits nearby. She munches popcorn. An exaggerated shrug. The batter sprints round the field, and the fans stand up, excitedly. Colin tries to get the attention of a food vendor. A girl grins at Mike. She lifts the hot dog to her lips. Shocked, she spills her drink in Colin's lap. A cameraman films Abby as she rubs the stain. Her head is bent over Colin's crotch, and her hair swishes back and forth, making it look like she's doing something quite different. She looks up and sees herself in a heart-shaped video screen above the scoreboard, the Kiss Cam. Abby and Colin walk home.",
    "1017": "Colin drives along in his silver BMW convertible with Abby beside him. They smile and chat. They head along a winding road through mountains, across a steel girder bridge, and through rolling countryside. Sitting on rocks beside a creek, Abby and Colin have a picnic. They clink glasses and drink wine. Colin teases Abby with some caviar, then pops it into her mouth. He looks away. She chews, winces, spits the caviar out, and grimaces. Abby quickly wipes her hand across her mouth, composes herself, and smiles at Colin. Abby and Colin walk barefoot over rocks spanning the creek. He wraps his arms around her, and they share a lingering kiss. In a coffee shop, Colin buys coffees for Abby and Joy. Grinning girlishly, they go to a table. As Colin pays, Joy mimes giving him a good seeing to, clenching her fists and thrusting her groin. On set, Mike's spooning chocolate into the mouth of a sexy babe. A man delivers a bouquet of red roses to Abby. Her mouth hangs open, and she and Joy do a little dance. Seeing Joy and Abby so excited, Mike's face falls. He turns back to the babe and sees he's smeared chocolate over her face. Distracted, he wipes it off. Mike and Abby sit in the SF Saloon and Grill. Abby's on the phone. She smiles at him. Mike's checking out an attractive woman wearing a crop top, who's standing at the bar, drinking a shot. Abby looks round at her. He stares at her intensely. Abby drinks her wine. Mike frowns, taken aback. Mike looks troubled. Abby watches Mike on the monitor. Abby steps up. Abby frowns. She goes to see Stuart in his office. She rolls her eyes.

She steps away, holding his hands, and returns with her back to him.",
    "1021": "They slowly drag out of view. Sadie focuses on her homework. Playing air guitar, Charlotte advances toward Sadie's bed, then retreats to the doorway and flings one arm out. Her sister ignores her. Leaving the door open, Charlotte sulks away. Now, Debbie steps out of a side door and opens a trash bin. She breaks up a pack of cigarettes and throws them away. She overturns a small pouch into the bin. She goes back inside. Pete comes out the same door with a plate carrying three cupcakes. Setting it aside, he opens the trash bin and overturns a large jar of candy. He throws the cupcakes in one at a time. Pete pauses at the last cupcake and takes a deep breath. He unwraps the cupcake, then takes a large bite. He starts to throw the rest in, then hesitates and takes another bite. Chewing blissfully, he holds the remainder over the trash. Pete leans in, devours the treat, and throws the last bite away. Now, he jogs on a treadmill with electrodes dotting his bare chest. In another exam room, a technician positions Debbie at a mammogram machine. A doctor stands close with his hand up Pete's hospital gown. In another office. Now, she sits in a dentist's chair.

Pete's dad follows his middle-aged wife to the backyard. Now, in an upscale restaurant. Debbie approaches the hostess. She points to a balding man wearing a jacket and tie sitting alone. He browses a menu at a table for two. Debbie stares at him as she takes a deep breath and rolls her shoulders. Later, he takes a bite of food. He raises an eyebrow. She shakes her head with a sad smile, then lowers her gaze. He takes out his phone. He steps away, leaving his phone on the table.",
    "1022": "Debbie looks down at her untouched plate. Her eyes shift to the phone and she picks it up. She scrolls through a number of pictures of her dad's family. A photo shows him huddled with his young wife, a teen boy and girl. In another photo, they stand around a soccer ball with the kids in uniform. A final photo shows him with his arm around his young daughter. Debbie pouts and slides the phone back. Debbie, Pete and the girls sit around plates of vegetables. Debbie sighs as Sadie storms away. Now, Pete and Debbie drive down the coast. They pull up to a luxury resort. Now, they hold hands as they walk away from the beach. Later, they enter a bright hotel room.

Pete flips her off. Now in a club. Later, they face several men. He removes a partial. Desi puts them in her mouth. Desi drapes her arms around Debbie, who laughs as the younger woman pulls her clothes. Desi returns the partial to a man with a shaved head. He snaps them in and smiles. On stage, at the Belasco. The crowd springs to its feet as the aging rockers take the stage. Many seats remain unoccupied toward the back and the balcony. At the bar, Pete wears a furrowed brow. Ronnie gives them a cowed wave. At the dance club, Desi and the hockey players surround Debbie as she pumps her fists. Later, the two women writhe sideways across the floor like MC Hammer.

Now, Debbie's car pulls up at an upscale apartment building. A doorman stands out front. Debbie stares at her awkwardly. Nodding, Desi gives a proud smile. Now, Pete lies on the bed using his tablet as Debbie enters. Debbie's smile fades as she stands before him, her sweater open with a nipple exposed. Pete glances between his tablet and his wife several times. Pete eyes her up and down, then closes the tablet case.

Now, in a school office. Debbie nods. Jill glares. Debbie shrugs. Pete nods slowly. Now, they exit the school and walk side by side, both wearing mischievous grins. Debbie glances at Pete, who glances back. They continue walking, coyly avoiding each other's gaze. Entering the parking lot together, Debbie moves in front of Pete and heads to her silver SUV. Pete strolls toward his blue Sedan and pulls the keys from his pocket. He briefly glances toward her. The couple enters separate vehicles at the same time. Later, at home. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table as Debbie serves the chicken. Debbie looks at Pete. Sadie storms away. Sitting down, Debbie rests her head on her hand.

Natalie looks down thoughtfully. Ryan gives an I-told-you-so look. Natalie looks uncertain. They walk through the lobby. They go to the registration desk for the Alpha-tech party. Ryan and Alex casually pick up name badges and neck bands. Looking a bit shifty, Natalie does the same and follows them around a corner. The threesome clip their name badges to their neck bands and hang them around necks. Alex reads Natalie's name badge. At the party in the hotel ballroom, Natalie, Alex and Ryan are at the bar getting drinks. They turn around and survey the scene.

Everyone points in the air and jumps around. Later, Ryan and Alex are at the table. He hands her a key card. They both smile. Natalie sings karaoke on a yacht in the harbor. A few drunken party guests, including Dave, are there. Alex and Ryan sit on a platform at the back of the yacht. He dangles his feet in the clear, blue water. They gaze at each other, then share a lingering kiss. The power fails. All the lights in the yacht go out. Ryan and Alex look back towards the city lights, some distance away.

The cardboard cut-out photo blows into the water. Ryan kneels on the edge of the wooden pier and reaches for the photo. He falls in the water. In his hotel room wearing a white towel and robe, Ryan dries the cut-out with a hair dryer. Ryan drags his case through the airport. Julie and Jim poke out of the top, looking a little wrinkled and worn. Detroit. The airport is shrouded in a snow storm. Ryan and Natalie drive along an icy road. They glance at each other awkwardly. Ryan parks in an office car park. He and Natalie get out. She holds an arm full of strategy packets. A security guard leads them through a busy, open plan office. They go into a smaller office.

    "1040": "The chase mounts a pedestrian area and crashes down a wide stone staircase, then rejoins the main road. Other cars desperately veer to the side as Taylor powers onward.

Barnes strides past them. Taylor follows him to a car. They all move to cars as President Ashton emerges from the elevator. The President gets into the car by which Barnes and Taylor are standing. They follow him in. The convoy, headed by the two motorcycles, sets off from the underground garage. Behind the motorcycles is a police car, then two four-by-fours with their tailgates open. Then two stretch limos with more vehicles bringing up the rear. Armed police line the route. Armed men in uniform are on rooftops and behind barred gates. In the Presidential limo, Taylor grins. Protesters grow rowdy as the motorcade passes them. The convoy stops by a statue of Pizarro at Spain. The Secret Service agents spill out. His car door is opened. Taylor and Barnes climb up. Barnes scowls as he scans the press photographers. His narrow face is permanently grim as he turns from the cameras and walks around the car to join Taylor and the President. Taylor and Barnes lead the way. The President is behind them. Holden and Matthews bring up the rear. Taylor glances across at Barnes as the group makes their way to the plaza. They emerge through an archway of the crowded plaza. The President strides towards a child in its mother's arms. He shakes the baby's hand.

Standing amongst the crowd is a chunky man in a blue and white checked shirt. He holds a video camera. Barnes notices a curtain twitch on an upper floor. Taylor follows Barnes' gaze. Barnes goes to speak into a mic in his cuff, but stops. Barnes' eyes are fixed on the window and the curtain. He speaks into his mic. Taylor and Barnes exchange a look. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt pointing his camera at the upper floors behind him to where Barnes saw the fluttering curtain. The man turns back around checking his camera.",

A bearded young man dashes to the podium. Barnes tackles him. Barnes stares down at the recumbent President. Taylor helps carry the President away. The President is loaded into an ambulance. The bearded young man. They lead him off. An exasperated look on his face, Holden turns away. They loop up on hearing the distant explosion. Barnes sees the man in the checked shirt. He runs to him and grabs his camera. Barnes points. They rewind the camera in vision. Both men stare at the LCD screen. Flames and black smoke rise into the air. The smoke clears. Barnes is lying on the ground. He regains consciousness. There is a scratch on his grubby face. Barnes hauls himself to his knees. Barnes struggles to get to his feet. There are small fires all around. A man throws a blanket over a women whose clothes are in flames. Barnes takes in the number of people lying injured. Barnes recalls the muzzle flashes in the window.

Barnes searches for the cell phone. Rex watches as Barnes keys in numbers on his cell phone. He speaks into his cuff mike. He dials a number. The PA whispers into her cellphone.

Inside, Lizzie begins to pace around the drawing room. Tears spring into her eyes. Darcy hurries into a room upstairs and stands in the middle of the room, looking deeply troubled. He dashes over to a bureau and pulls out a sheet of paper. Picking up a pen, he dips it into an ink pot, then sets about writing a letter. He replenishes the nib with ink. He puts down the pen and leans back in his chair with a defeated air. He goes over to the paned window. The two young boys with their fishing rods and nets. They scramble down a hill towards the river. Darcy, striding through cloisters in his gown and mortarboard. Darcy throws open a door to find Wickham in a compromising position with a lady.

Georgiana and Wickham walk arm-in-arm by the sea. Darcy's carriage pulls up at the sea front. He jumps down and peers over a wall. Wickham and Georgiana are on the rocks below together. Georgiana spies her brother, her face breaks into a smile. When the door has closed behind Wickham, Georgiana turns her sorrowful gaze to Darcy, then slowly walks over to be comforted by him. Letter finished, and now disheveled Darcy leans wearily back in chair and closes his eyes. Then, with renewed energy, he dips his pen in the ink pot once more. Outside, the sun is setting, casting a salmon pink glow over Rosings. The next morning, Darcy splashes his face with water from a silver basin, then pats it dry. He's still wearing the same white shirt from the night before, with the top few buttons undone. His manner is troubled and agitated. He snuffs out last night's candle, which is all but burned out. On the bureau is the sealed letter addressed to Miss Elizabeth Bennet. Lizzy wanders over to the breakfast table. Lizzy heads out, leaving the others to resume their breakfast. It's a bright, sunny day, and Lizzy's taking a walk in the park, swinging her bonnet casually to and fro. Suddenly, she breaks into a run, racing as fast as she can across the grass. She slows down to a walk again, and heads onward through the trees, not really taking in her surroundings. Suddenly, she becomes aware of a man standing with his back to her, a few meters ahead. He turns, just as she's trying to slip away unnoticed.",

Jane and Lizzie rise from their seats. Lizzie and Jane have sat back down again, and Mr. Collins regards the three girls with condescension. The three sisters are now standing, watching him coldly. Having backed out of the parlor, he makes his way over to the curricle outside. With a sympathetic shake of the head, he climbs up into the carriage. Lizzie and Jane have come out to see him off. They wave him off. As soon as the coast is clear, Kitty peers out from behind a wall. She bustles over to the house. Lydia is sitting, looking out of a lead-paned window, humming happily to herself.

Jane and Lizzie are watching him with some concern. The two sisters exchange worried glances. Mr. Darcy is wandering through a cobbled street, bustling with people and horses. He makes his way down the crowded street, looking slightly lost. When he reaches a corner, a young beggar girl stops him to ask for money. As he searches his pockets for coins, he asks her for directions. She indicates the road he should take. Finally, he finds the house he's looking for and bangs on the door. As the door opens, a woman looks shocked to see Darcy. Her housekeeper quickly tries to shut him out. The Bennet sisters are still sitting in the parlor. Jane puts down her book and is just going to pour the tea when Mr. Bennet comes in. All four girls look at him expectantly as he takes a seat. Kitty is sobbing. Seeing Kitty's distress, Mr. Bennet's face falls, and he leaves the room. Meanwhile, Mr. Darcy is back out, searching the darkened streets, clutching a piece of paper in his hand. He gazes up at a house. Lydia, meanwhile, is getting more and more bored by the minute. She gets up off the bed and wanders over to the window. Wickham's drinking wine. A young man is galloping along on horseback in the bright sunshine. The housekeeper peers out of the window at Longbourn, and seeing the messenger arriving, quickly hurries out to meet him. He pulls a letter out of his saddlebag, dismounts, and gives it to her in exchange for a few coins.",

She waves to an older fresh-faced lad in the violin section. The youngsters tape the mickey and Jenny size in frustration. Jenny and the violinist exchange glances as they play. Later, Jenny frowns at the sky. She leaves orchestra practice and stands getting soaked at the bus stop. A car speeds past, nearly running over a woman with a pram and a young boy. The car pulls over beside Jenny. She avoids eye-contact with the handsome driver. He gets out of the car, runs around to put the cello in the back seat, and gets back behind the wheel. He drives up at walking pace beside Jenny. She hops into the passenger seat. David changes gear. They arrive on Jenny's niche tree-lined street. A large black car overtakes them. David nods and gives a tight smile. Jenny smiles and gets out of the car. Lying on the floor of her room, Jenny sings along with the record which spins on the small player on the floor. Jenny winces as Graham flounders. He resorts to his tea. On another day, Jenny meets the card in a large bouquet of flowers. Her father frowns. Her mother smirks as Jenny strides off on the garden path. David has crossed the road in front of them. Jenny agonizes. They shake hands. Jenny heads back to her friends. They sit awkwardly in the living room. Jack studies David. David gallantly kisses Marjorie's hand. David and Jenny run through the London rain, up stone steps to the concert venue. The men and women pair up and go in. Jenny admires glamorous blond Helen. She touches her fur stole. The pair walk off together. Helen taps Jenny playfully on the shoulder. Jenny and David listen with rapt attention to the concert. Helen looks unimpressed and sleepy. Danny concentrates serenely. Jenny smiles to herself as she listens. Later, everyone files out of the concert hall. They walk to the night club. A platinum blonde singer fronts the band.",
    "1061": "She looks at him, shifting awkwardly. Davids smiles but squirms at her discomfort. He indicates that's a yes. Jenny smiles and pulls her nightie off her shoulders. David heaves a sigh. Embarrassed, Jenny avoids eye contact. Then David smiles, stands and moves to her. He pulls her nightie back on. He goes to kiss her. He hugs her instead. Her arms remained by her sides. Then she puts them round him. They hold one another. Sun shines on the small village. The Bristol pulls up at some old-timbered houses. Jenny stands completely aghast as the men walk away. She and Helen walk through a cemetery. They've slipped a picture in the back of the car. Jenny stops playing ball with some children and harries over. The picture, a map is sitting between Jenny and Helen on the back seat. Jenny eyes him wearily. Later they arrive at Danny's place. Jenny takes her bags and strides off. Pausing at the cab Jenny doesn't even look at David. She stops angrily on the middle of the road. She turns to him. He wonders over wanting to explain. He looks at her imploringly, then grins. She can't help to grin back. He takes all of her bags. She makes a show of pulling away. He takes her hand and twirls her around. They hug and slow dance in the street. On a colonnaded balcony, Danny hold up two glasses. At night the Bristol arrives back at Jenny's house. Jenny sits glumly in the passenger seat. David looks across at her. Wearing a tight smile, she doesn't look at him. He smiles lovingly at her, looks down. Very slowly they lean together and kiss. She pulls away. They smile then sit awkwardly. Jenny puts her handbag on the kitchen table. She shows it to her father. Marjorie stops her cake baking. She goes to look at the book. Jenny licks cake mixture of the whisk. She grins to herself. At school the girls are in their PE get out for a run. Jenny and her friends are hiding behind a tree smoking. The teacher arrives. The girls file out of the classroom. Tina sticks her tongue out. Jenny enters the heads' wood paneled office. The headmistress watches Jenny leave. At home, the dinning room is in darkness. Graham has come for tea. Jenny closes her eyes. Marjorie puts the candle decked cake down in front of Jenny. Jack switches the lights back on. Marjorie drops Graham's slice of cake. Jenny unwraps the present. Jenny tries to look pleased. She shows Graham. Jenny accepts the gift with a tight smile. She places it on the other one. Jack gets up to answer the door. David is laden with presents.",
    "1065": "They stare at each other and she smiles breathlessly. Drover smiles suavely at her, and she grins broadly. Allsop signals to the band. Drover makes his way down the steps towards the teeming dance floor. He and Sarah move slowly towards each other. She smiles in delighted disbelief and he grins, his hand casually in his left pocket, as they come together. She smiles demurely. Arm-in-arm, they head for the dance floor. Carney's wife and the other women stare at them. Up on a balcony, Fletcher grabs a black waitress' hand. Sarah helps him through the steps. Carney watches and swigs from a bottle. Up on the balcony, Fletcher does the same. Carney watches the dance, laughing heartily and drinks deeply. Drover and Sarah dance cheek-to-cheek. She smiles and nods. In the night, lightning flashes over Darwin Wharf. He looks at her seriously. She turns and looks up at the storm clouds then closes her eyes, tilting her face up to catch the rain. They kiss as it starts to pour down. The crowds at the pub cheer the rain's arrival and dance in the street. At the outdoor theater, the audience leave their seats. All except Nullah, who continues to stare, transfixed, at the screen. The ball guests huddle on the colonnaded verandah of the house where Carney holds court. People dance around Drover and Sarah in the rain-soaked street. Sarah holds her hands joyfully in the air. Goolaj remains in his seat at the theater smiling happily at the down pour. Smiling, Fletcher staggers towards the soaking dance floor, trips over a plant pot and falls flat on his face. Sarah kisses Drover. Carney steps away from his daughter to approach Fletcher. Sarah and Drover continue to kiss passionately. Their eyes lock together, but closes the cab door rather then get in. A servant holds an umbrella over Carney's head as he walks up to the fallen Fletcher. He scowls at his drunken son-in-law and walks off. Fletcher nods slowly, watching him go. On the screen, Dorothy clicks her emerald heels together. Drover and Sarah run up the stairs to Sarah's room with the balcony. Indoors, they kiss passionately. They break apart and stare at one another. They look longingly at each other. Naked in bed, they make love tenderly. He kisses her neck. They touch gently. He slides the dress off her shoulders and she opens the front of his shirt. She pulls the shirt off his muscled torso and, in just her petticoat, pulls him down onto the bed. They lie in each other's arms, naked, covered by just a sheet. The door to the room swings closed, as lightning flashes and the rain pours down on nighttime Darwin.",
    "1070": "As the boys run pell-mell into the water, the Japanese soldiers advance past the Mission buildings. The refugees pick their way through the ruins of the Mission's wooden jetty. The Japanese are searching the buildings on the beach. Magarri runs through the shallows with his rifle. The boys move out beyond the end of the burning jetty and start to swim. The Japanese run down to the beach. Magarri loads and hides behind one of the wharf's supports. Magarri gasps in fear, as the soldiers approach. The boys use a piece of driftwood as a float. The soldiers follow footprints down the beach. Magarri takes aim. Drover and the boys arrive at the boat. They climb the ladder as soldiers fire at Magarri, who shoots back. As Magarri reloads, he looks across at Drover and the boys climbing onto the boat. He looks round at the soldiers getting closer. He drops his rifle and sprints up the beach to distract the Japanese. Drover gasps as Magarri, hit in the back, falls to the sand. He and the boys stare helplessly, as the soldiers run up to the wounded man. The soldiers raise their rifles and an officer cocks his pistol. Magarri looks towards the boat. Drover and the boys watch as the soldiers move away from the body. The sail is raised and Ivan gets slowly to his feet. Flames roar into the air and King George, watching the soldiers work in the ruin, rubs dye into his cheeks. The soldiers move slowly through the flaming, smoking ruins of Darwin. Hoses spray water on the fires. Captain Dutton gets out of the truck. In her wrecked room over the pub, Sarah looks at a photograph of her, Nullah and Drover. She looks tearfully down at Dutton issuing orders on the wharf. His eyes fill with tears of self-pity. Bomb ships burn in the bay. Dutton comes up to Sarah's room. Eyes closed, tears roll down her cheeks. The boys' boat sails into Darwin. Men clamber into trucks, ready to evacuate south. The small boat sails past a huge burning ship. Sarah tearfully watches the evacuation. A black soldier stands stripped to the waist, watching the trucks. Sarah looks at the ruins of the Territory Hotel and sighs. As she climbs into the truck, the small boat sails into view by the wharf. King George is up on the wreck of the Carney Cattle Company water tower. Nullah reaches into his pocket and pulls out Flynn's harmonica. Sarah hesitates by the truck, Listening. Shocked, she turns to Dutton. Drover strokes the lad's hair as he plays. The priest conducts the choir. Drover stands at the stern of the boat.",
    "1071": "She runs down the peer as the boat draws alongside. Nullah and Sarah peer through the smoke. The boy stands up on the prow of the boat and grins. He jumps up and down excitedly and runs off the boat onto the jetty. He runs up the wooden steps to the upper level of the wharf and sprints through the smoke towards Sarah. Nullah points and she turns slowly. There in the smoke stands the Drover. Their eyes meet and they walk slowly towards one another. Drover frowns in disbelief, then smiles and they embrace. They cling to each other tears running down their cheeks. They break apart and look joyfully at one another, then kiss. Nullah runs up and hugs them both. Drover grins happily. The army sergeant sounds the horn of his truck and smiles. Dutton stops and stares at Sarah, Drover and the boys. He's taken aback by her hug. The sergeant stomps up to the young priest. Fletcher grimly watches the boys, streaming towards the trucks. Sarah rests her head on Drover's shoulder and caresses his cheek. Dutton turns to them. Dutton smiles tearfully. He nods and walks away. Fletcher strides angrily towards the truck the boys are getting into. Dutton's the last on. The tailgate is raised and the trucks head off. Fletcher runs through the devastation, watched from the water tower by King George. Sarah's walking with Nullah. King George looks in horror, as Fletcher grabs Bull's rifle. King George raises his arms in his magic-man stance, as Fletcher advances with the rifle. King George watches Fletcher closely. Sarah smiles, as Nullah runs towards the pub. Fletcher stands on top of a pile of wreckage and aims the rifle. Sarah spots the danger and, at the pub, Drover sees Fletcher. Drover runs for the boy. King George pulls a pipe off the water tower. Fletcher grimaces and Drover falls to the ground with Nullah. King George's pipe has run Fletcher through like a spear. King George glares at him. Drover strokes his hair. The unconscious boy's eyes flicker. Nullah grins. Fletcher tries to aim the rifle at King George. Fletcher winces and drops the rifle. Sarah reaches Drover and Nullah. Fletcher tries to speak and then collapses over a piece of wreckage. Sarah cuddles Nullah. Sergeant Callahan checks Fletcher's pulse. Sarah and Drover gaze into each other's eyes. They kiss, tenderly. Callahan walks away from Fletcher's body, across the wrecked King Carney cattle pen. Smoke hangs in palls over the destruction of Darwin. Drover drives the car in the sunshine, with Sarah and Nullah asleep next to him. Sarah picks up kindling for a fire in a field next to a river. She straightens and stares.",
    "1074": "Down below, Flynn is drinking rum. He hides the bottle behind a Bible. He stands sheepishly, hands in his pockets. She looks at a loss. She downs her tea cup of rum at a gulp. A herd of horses has been being rounded up. They thunder right past the house. Sarah looks out of the door in amazement and stares straight into the eyes of the Drover, galloping alongside the herd. Flynn laughs in delight and Nullah leaps for joy. Sarah runs along the verandah watching the spectacle. Drover reins his horse in, stares at Sarah and takes off again. The horses are all rounded up. She runs indignantly after him. She gets off her knees. She looks him right in the eye. He considers the sleek black thoroughbred leaping in its enclosure. He eyes her and walks off. She's dressed for the English countryside. She trots off in a huff as they start to ride around the cattle, moving them in to a single herd. She gallops after the lone steer. Back at the house. Her luggage is being packed. The sun beats down on the homestead and the windmill turns slowly. Nullah and Daisy are carrying items of luggage for Sarah. A truck is approaching. Nullah spots it. His eyes widen. Nullah frantically climbs to the water tank as Sing Song grabs the dropped bags. Sarah watches from indoors. Daisy climbs with her son. They are around the back of the tank, hidden from the truck. Daisy is about to get in with the boy, but has to duck down and stay on the ladder to avoid being seen as the truck comes to a halt. Sarah pulls back the curtain and looks out at the cops. As the men look the other way, Daisy hurriedly climbs in after Nullah. She takes the tea tray to her. One man walks slowly towards the tank. Daisy clings in fear to the ladder inside the tank, as the cop turns the water on in the pump. More water floods in the tank. Daisy holds her hand up for Nullah to grab. Tracker crouches. Daisy and Nullah cling frantically to the ladder. The ladder collapses and they fall into the water. Daisy lifts Nullah to grab on to a pipe. She gets a grip too. The bar breaks and more water floods in. The sergeant looks out at the water tower. The Aboriginal tracker looks up and sees water poring out of holes at the top of the tower. But more continues to pour from the tower. Daisy puts her hand over Nullah's mouth. The tracker walks slowly away as the windmill turns faster. Daisy flounders and sinks beneath the surface.",
    "1075": "Nullah notices and drops in after her. She eyes him coldly. He studies her and smiles. The Drover rides up as they pull away. In the tank. Nullah brings Daisy to the surface. As the truck drives away down the dusty road, Drover hauls Daisy's body from the tank. Sarah sprints over. Nullah desperately hugs his mother. Drover hangs his head as Nullah clings to the body. Bandy runs out of the house. The cop's truck continues down the long, straight, dusty truck, into the vast scrub lands of Faraway Downs. The windmill turns slowly at sunset. Sarah looks tearfully out towards Daisy's blazing funeral pyre. Smoke drifts from the top a rocky summit nearby. Magarri signals to the hilltop. He waves to King George who starts to chant. The body is carried towards the fire. The old man looks down on the homestead from his hilltop. In the soft glow of dawn. Sarah steps out of the house as Drover sits down on the fence and lights a cigarette. She looks distraught. He frowns and she avoids his gaze. She walks to where Nullah is grieving. He's lying curled up on the ground on a mattress. She's completely at a loss. She crouches down next to him and lays newspapers from a pile out on the ground to kneel on. She kneels and thinks. The nearest front page has an advert for a film. He looks up and sees the smoke on the hilltop. She looks perplexed. He holds up his hand with a cloth tied around it. She's not sure how to proceed. He watches her expectantly. She finishes with a self-deprecating flourish. Her eyes fill with tears. In the blazing sun. Sarah faces Drover in the saddle. Nullah looks up and a twister starts to form in the dust in front of the house. He looks unconvinced. Flynn salutes. He eyeballs Sarah. Bandy and Flynn node. Sing Song winks. Nullah grins. Sing Song's chop wagon moves on as Drover opens the gate to the cattle pen. Drover marshals his motley gang of riders as the huge herd moves out of the pen, raising a massive cloud of dust. The army of cattle moves off. King George follows their progress from his rocky mountain top. The herd approaches a wide river. Drover and Sarah ride ahead of the cattle. The others ride behind and alongside, keeping them together. Sing Song drives his wagon in to the water. The crossing's successful. Crowds fill an open-air cinema in nighttime Darwin. Carney stares grimly. He drops a curtain down between himself and Fletcher, who turns angrily away. The drive moves on through the soft light of sunset. They approach a range of jagged vertical cliffs.",
    "108": "Forrest stands next to George Wallace and listens. Some of the Alabama policeman and citizens clap their hands as the National Guardsmen stand at attention with their weapons in front of them. Forrest walks through the crowd. Two black students were being led toward the schoolhouse. The young black girl drops one of her books. Forrest notices and steps past the policeman toward the book on the ground. Forrest steps out from the crowd and picks up the book. He brings it up to the girl. A coach looks at the television. The television reveals Forrest as he stands at the schoolhouse door. He looks around, then waves. An assistant coach looks at the television, then at the other coaches. The football coach and two assistant coaches look. Forrest dries himself off with a towel as he steps from the showers. COLOR FOOTAGE - Governor Wallace mingles in a crowd. Gunshots are fired, wounding him. Some men wrestle the shooter. Wallace lies wounded on the ground. Forrest sits on the bench as the black woman looks at him. A WHITE WOMAN with a bay sits left. A bus pulls up to the bus stop. The BLACK WOMAN looks down at her watch. The Black Woman gets up and steps over to the bus. The white woman sits closer to Forrest. Forrest sits outside Jenny's dorm in the rain. A car pulls up. A song is heard from the radio. Forrest, holding a box of chocolates, looks at the car. The two people inside the car begins to kiss and embrace each other. Jenny is inside the car with a boy. She leans back against the passenger side door as they struggle to get comfortable. Billy gets back into the car. Billy pulls away as Jenny steps toward Forrest. Forrest holds out the box of chocolates. Jenny grabs Forrest hand and leads him toward the dorm. Jenny and Forrest sneak to Jenny's door. Jenny unlocks the door and they step inside. Jenny pulls a robe off of her sleeping roommate's bed. Jenny hands the robe to Forrest, sitting on Jenny's bed. Jenny picks up a towel, then walks back toward Forrest. Jenny dries the water from her hair. Jenny takes off her slip and sits on the bed next to him. She is only wearing her bra and panties. Forrest looks at Jenny like he's never seen a woman in her underwear before. Forrest looks down at Jenny's breasts. Jenny realizes that he is looking at her. Jenny leans over and puts her head on Forrest's shoulder. A song is coming over the radio. Jenny hugs Forrest. Jenny laughs and kisses Forrest on the cheek. Forrest and Jenny hug on the bed as Jenny's roommate pretends to be asleep, but is listening, horrified, with her eyes open.",
    "1082": "Asael covers up the potato stash with some sacking, and climbs out of the hole. In one of the huts, Layla, sits huddled at a table. Shimon and Malbin are trying to keep a chess game going on their knees. Weaver, the nurse, is rubbing ointment onto a man's frost-bitten toes. Rachel is sitting with her grandfather. Lazar addresses those present. In his cabin, Tuvia knocks back some vodka and stares grimly ahead. Later in the snowy woodland, he comes into a clearing holding his horse by its bridle. He strokes its white muzzle and with a deep sigh takes his revolver out of its holster. Malbin hurrying through the snow with an armful of kindling stops in his tracks. Arkady insists on a bigger portion than the rest. Morosely, Tuvia watches the people elbowing each other out of the way, and walks past Malbin without acknowledging him. Elsewhere in the forest commander Panchenko and Gramov ride ahead of the column of soldiers who are walking behind them. At their base camp, Zus gulps back some vodka, and passes the bottle to Panchenko, who drains it, and tosses it over his shoulder. Zus looks across at Viktor Panchenko. Zeus face turns to the side. At the camp Tuvia in his heavy gray coat and hat, machine gun over his shoulder, steps into a dark cabin where Lilka is sitting by a stove. He put the gun down, and whips off his hat. He throws a small log into the stove. He smiles at her as he rubs his hands. His cheeks tense. He drapes his coat around her shoulders, and she thanks him with a nod. Reaching into his trouser pocket, he brings out his revolver. He flashes her a brief smile, and she goes. From outside the door where Arkady leers in at him. Lazar with a wounded man. Tuvia sees Lilka Setting off to find food. Lilka wrapped up in Tuvia's coat and her shawl over her head, with a bag over her shoulder, goes off into the wintry forest. Lilka wanders into a frosty dell. There are animal tracks in the snow ahead of her, and through the mist she sees an Alsatian staring back at her. She starts to retreat. The hound bounds towards her. She turns and runs. He leaps on her back, knocking her down. She leans up against a tree and watches in terror as it tears at the food stock with its sharp teeth. She stretches out her hand to reach the sack. The dog bares its teeth. It leaps up, and they both fall to the ground. She raises her head. In her hand, she's holding the gun. She walks back to camp with the dead dog slung across her shoulders.",
    "1085": "Malbin hurries up to meet him. Handing Malbin the gun, Tuvia runs off to investigate. He whips back a curtain across the door of a cabin. Lilka, Bella and Riva are with Tamara and her baby. He strides away. Tuvia gazes at Lilka and his face softens. She plants a kiss on his lips. He looks at her in mute surprise. She stands in front of him unflinching. Slowly he moves his mouth towards hers lightly brushing her lips. They kiss more fully. He smiles and their lips meet again. Beyond some trees, a German truck full of soldiers drives across a metal bridge followed by a car. Aron, hiding behind a tree, watches faithfully. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin are hunched over their chess set. A message bag, a German courier. People crowd round the blond head German. Tuvia checks Aron's cheek. Then sits down at the table. And opens the courier's leather case. He hands a document to Shimon. Malbin watches anxiously as people's anger turns to violence. Tuvia has his back turned as a bearded Jew spits on a man. And Shelman the man who brought him, kicks him in the back. Tuvia and Shimon hurry over. Tuvia remains at a distance watching the mob take over. The German is felled. Aaron, his cheek swollen turns away. Bella viciously slams the man with her rifle butt. Tuvia glances at Asael and walks off. Shimon and Malbin wincing, watch the mob savagely beat the man to death. With eyes dulled and a numbed expression. Tuvia comes across Aron sitting hunched on a mossy bank. His rifle on his lap. A hand to his mouth. Tuvia leans against a tree and watches his young brother's distress. Asael observes from a distance. At night, a guard patrols the camp. In his cabin, bathed in golden lamplight, Tuvia is sitting up in bed bare-chested with Lilka lying against him, covered by a blanket. He pulls her close to him and they settle down to sleep. Early one morning, at the army camp, Zus strides into Viktor's tent. Viktor turns to Zus. Zus turns to leave the commander's hut. Zus strides past Lova. Zus glancing at a German plane crossing the sky. At the camp Tuvia and Malbin see it too. People pack up their belongings. Guns and grenades loaded into Baskets and bags. Tuvia peers up to the sky at a plane changing direction. He dives towards Aron as the bomber passes overhead. People run in all directions as bombs explode around them. Many are hit. Tuvia and Lilka herd women and children through the smoke and flame towards the largest bunker. A woman is hit. More and more people are bundled into the shelter.",
    "1086": "Tuvia, weaving his way between the trees, is knocked off his feet by an exploding shell. As he groggily struggles to raise his head, his blue eyes seem dazed. Behind him, a bunker explodes, throwing bodies in all directions in a cascade of debris. In slow motion, a man runs through the trees amid the dust and flames. Tuvia, clutching a slender tree branch, his body position dazed, watches a bomber fly across the sky about to drop another bomb. Malbin appears out of the haze, pulls him towards a shelter. Asael arrives at the same moment. Tuvia slaps down against the wall of the bunker. The planes are flying away. Asael breaks from Tuvia. Malbin herds people out of the bunker. The survivors run through the trees, some carrying bundles, others armed with rifles. Chaya clings desperately to Asael. He and Tuvia take up gun positions behind a bunker. Asael glance his sideways and sees Chaya positioning her rifle. He watches his young wife being urged away. His nose bleeding, Tuvia walks away from the burning remains of the camp, leaving a few men and women standing behind the mossy roots of their bunkers with weapons poised, keeping their sights fixed on the woodland ahead of them. Among them, Lazar, Lilka, and Asael. Deeper in the forest, the rest of the community hurry through the bare trees. The shooters leaning on the roofs of the shelters scan the horizon. One of the women is hit. Asael fires at the unseen enemy. Tuvia stops to listen to the sound of gunfire. Another man is down. Asael keeping his head low scurries to a new position. A machine gunner falls to the ground. Lazar runs on. The others give him cover. Asael scrambles sideways, firing as he runs. The bunker behind him is blown to smithereens. Asael pulls an injured woman, Layla, to safety. Lazar with rifle in hand, ducks behind a tree. Lazar reloads. Seeing Asael crawling towards him with Layla hurt, he propels himself out from behind the tree and runs towards the enemy. His body is tossed into the air like a rag doll. Asael looks behind him and sees a female shoot a hit, her arm still clinging to her machine gun. Her head goes limp, but the gun goes on firing. Deeper in the misty forest. Tuvia at the head of his flock, faced as he strides on, a machine gun is held across his body. Further on, with Malbin, Bella, and Shulman behind him, he comes into a clearing. But his pale blue eyes scan the horizon. Stretching ahead of them with no end in sight is marshland. Aron and Rachel, Tamara cuddling her baby look up at the sky.",
    "1089": "Aron, sitting with his legs drawn up in front of him, slowly gets up to his feet, and throws the cloth bundle over his shoulder. Dark green conifers stretch as far as the eye can see. A man strides through the undergrowth and comes across Asael lying asleep by a tree with Aron in his arms. The stone-faced man in his late thirties, in a cloth cap and a brown leather jacket over heavy wool trousers, picks up a stone and tosses it onto the ground. Asael wakes up. He gets to his feet. Tuvia grabs him roughly. The two brothers hug fiercely. Tuvia beckons to their youngest brother, and all three stand locked in a hug. Zus appears carrying kindling. Tuvia nods bitterly as Zus fishes in his pocket, and brings out the mezuzah. He tosses it to Tuvia, then drops the kindling to the ground. As Zus starts snapping the twigs, Tuvia glances at the Hebrew markings on the mezuzah, and hugs Aron even more tightly. Zus hands Tuvia some vodka. The four of them huddle together in the pouring rain. Aron sits with a coat on his head listening quietly. They have a little fire near to a stream. Tuvia crouches down next to Zus who is the tallest of the three adults. Elsewhere in the forest ants scurry over a mound of twigs. Aron pushes a stick into the mud with a curious expression and watches several ants climb onto it. He brings the stick closer to him and studies their movements. He reels around and spots a female figure running through the trees some distance away. He gets to his feet and starts to run after her. He stops between two silver birch trees and watches the teen girl run towards a gray bearded man in a Homburg hat, shirt and waistcoat and suit trousers sitting on a log with a little girl in his arms. Aron looks in another direction and sees a young man accompanying an old woman. From behind more trees, a man in a black hat and black overcoat with a smartly dressed woman in a stylish bearing. Clutching his stick, Aron steps towards a mud ditch in the middle of a clearing. The long winding ditch is full of dead bodies piled on top of each other. Aron's eyes fill with horror. His brothers are sitting around the fire. Zus and Tuvia look at each other. Aron has brought the old man and the child. Tuvia lays the child down near the fire. Zus armed with a rifle watches the other people arrive. He and Tuvia glance at each other in mute surprise. The old man weeps and strokes the little girl's glossy dark hair.",
    "1091": "At night in pouring rain with the collar of his jacket pulled up, Tuvia stands staring at a cottage in the clearing, his lips pursed. Inside Berniski, his wife and two sons who were with him at Koscik's house, are having dinner. They all look towards the door as Tuvia walks into the room. Berniscki jumps up. Tuvia draws the gun. Berniski shrugs lamely. Cowering Berniscki sinks to his knees. One son stands up. Tuvia dispatches both sons then Berniscki. Then Berniski dies. Tuvia looks at the woman without remorse as she mourns before him. Her hands splattered with blood. He goes. Stumbling through the dark forest. Makes his escape. At dawn Zus sleeping in a makeshift tent, awakes with a start. A bottle of vodka by his legs. Groggily he looks at the sleeping people all around him. Picking up the bottle, he staggers to his feet. Then notices smoke from a small fire. Tuvia sitting broodily staring into the space. Zus hands his brother the bottle. Tuvia takes a slug. And Zus examines the revolver. Counting the number of bullets. A fleeting smile passes between them. Zus hands back the gun. Sharpening a spear, Zus looks up in surprise as Tuvia comes back to the camp with more refugees. A pretty brunette walks by and gives Tuvia a long look. Later two men are sawing a log. Later, another lays branches onto the roof of a shelter. Zus hammers a beam. Malbin, hammering a nail, drops the log he's holding narrowly missing Zus. Malbin turns to Tuvia. Zus frowns. The girl with a beret. Lazar and Laila walk off. Everyone looks around. Two young men enter the camp, one wielding a rifle. Zus puts his hands up. The brothers stiffen. Zus eyes them steadily. Peretz meets his gaze and slowly shakes his head. Zus walks away, stumbling into the undergrowth. He throws up by a tree and sinks to his knees. Tuvia follows him and watches his brother convulsing with grief. Zus bangs his head against the tree trunk. Tuvia grabs him from behind and wrestles him to the ground. Blood seeps from the wound on Zus' head. He frees himself from his brother's grasp. The two newcomers, Peretz and Jacov, are talking to Asael. Tuvia runs off to Zus. Tuvia looks at Asael who averts his gaze and then back at Zus. A full moon gleams in the dark sky. Zus shoots the man. Zus shouts. An elderly Russian runs out to his blazing truck. Zus dispatches him. Together with Tuvia, Asael, Peretz, and Jacov, he tosses the old man's body into the burning bed of the truck. A pin prick of light punctures the darkness. Peretz running along a dirt track joins the others hiding in a ditch.",
    "1094": "Bella walks up to Zus who is sitting on a log. Her dark hair cut short and wearing a grey wool coat, she sits down on the log. And they exchange a brief smile. Zus offers her a sip from his hip flask. She meets his playful expression with a shrug, and then a smile. She takes the flask and drinks from it. He looks, then lowers his eyes. His dark eyes hold her in his gaze, and she nods faintly. This time, she looks Zus straight in the eye. Tentatively, he raises his hand and touches her cheek with his fingers, gently pulling at her bottom lip with his thumb. She takes hold of his hand with her hand and places it on her right breast, discretely covering his hand with a coat and holding his gaze. Elsewhere, Aron and his friend, Rachel, tramp through the spindly birch trees. In the distance, they spot Kissely the milkman running ahead of a unit of armed men in black uniforms. The two youngsters dive behind a rock. Zus and Tuvia, their guns up and ready, urge the men and women to flee. And Benzion in a fur hat leads them across a shallow stream. Kissely and the policemen with guns arrive at the camp. One of the Bielski group carries a goat across the stream. A woman stumbles and falls into the water. Zus helps her up. Carrying bags and baskets, the people scramble up a slope. Tuvia and other men with guns scoot back down the hill to take up positions behind trees. The Russian policemen and helmeted soldiers come into view below them. Zus, Tuvia, and the others fire. One wounded soldier is helped away from the stream. The bearded milkman cowers behind a tree. Zus stops to reload. The policeman looks back at his half a dozen men. Zus hits the milkman's arm. Tuvia unleashes a salvo of bullets. The policeman skulking behind a tree calls to his men to go. Tuvia watches them retreating through the trees. He and the others stride forward in a line. And Zus reloads. Tuvia's cheeks tighten as he ponders his brother's words, but he runs off after the others. The displaced community of men, women, and children clutching their bundles of possessions. Some in hats and coats. Others in flat caps and jackets. Many of the women with shawls on their heads tramp through the forest, dwarfed by the tall, thin, bare trees. They come out onto a meadow of tall grasses wafting in the breeze. Walking almost in single file, like black shadows moving across the landscape. Tuvia and Ben Zion, Behind them Zus with Bella by his side, Lead the way out of the wood.",
    "1096": "Zus holds a protective hand in front of his face. People watch in mute shock. With a livid scowl, Tuvia drops the stone on the ground and gets to his feet. Zus sits up and wipes his mouth. Straightening his jacket, he looks around at the assembled people staring at him. Benzion picks up his gun. Zus addresses Asael, who's standing with Chaya. The two young people look at each other. Zus looks at them both and affectionately pats Asael on the cheek. He turns to find Bella standing behind him. Without a word, he grabs his machine gun, and with a line of volunteers behind, strides off past Tuvia. At Nowogrodek, Nazi soldiers stand guard as Jewish men and women wearing yellow stars file into the ghetto. Tuvia and Asael stride purposefully past the ghetto entrance. They carefully tread along a low-tiled roof. They climb down at the far end of the roof and hurry towards the interior of the ghetto. On an unpaved woodland track, the army general Panchenko astride a tall black horse with Gramov at his side rides at the head of an infantry column toward Zus and his men standing by the side of the track. Panchenko nods at Zus who nods back. As the Russian commander moves on, Zus and his men fall in with the Russian foot soldiers. A Jewish elder at the ghetto, the room is packed with smartly dressed, solemn looking people. Tuvia addresses two women in the room. Tuvia looks despairingly at Asael. A beautiful young woman steps forward. Under a cover of darkness, as the ghetto people stream out of a house tearing off their yellow stars, one Jewish man hiding in a doorway peers towards the floodlit square where German guards are on duty in front of the barb wired entrance to the ghetto. He beckons to Asael across the dark narrow street where the people have gathered. Asael ushers them out through a hole in the wall and into the street, leaving behind a pile of yellow fabric stars. At daybreak, carrying bags and cases, they walk in single file across the wintry landscape towards a windmill and on into the Birchwood forest. At the camp, Shimon and Malbin are sitting behind a makeshift desk on which people are putting their valuables. She and her parents hug each other. Shimon addresses an elderly man. Tuvia shows the man a loose trigger on a rifle. The watchmaker hands back the rifle. The trigger works. Tuvia on his horse, young and old listen with rapt attention. Malbin nods approvingly. A curly-haired boy turns to Lilka, the beautiful newcomer. Asael supervises shooting practice. Elsewhere, women are sitting at sewing machines.",
    "1097": "Six silver interlocking V shapes of decreasing sizes. A hearse and several cars are parked outside a large Catholic church. A balding man plays the organ. A small congregation sits in pews towards the front of the grand church. An older man, Al, gets up from his pew and walks past a coffin draped in a white sheet. Al walks up to him. On a table in front of the coffin is a photograph of an attractive middle-aged woman. Standing beside the coffin is a tall hard-faced elderly man, Walt Kowalski. Al shakes Walt's hand and goes back to his pew. Four casually-dressed teenage kids -- Daniel, David, Ashley and Josh -- walk up the aisle. They each kneel and make the sign of the cross. Ashley, a pretty girl with red hair, wears a short top exposing her pierced belly button. Seeing this, Walt grimaces. Josh, a thin boy with fair hair, is last to kneel, bow and make the sign of the cross. Walt watches the kids, tight-lipped, eyes narrowed. His middle-aged sons, Mitch and Steve, turn to each other. Walt stands motionless like a stone statue. Mitch gives Steve a withering look. Mitch's wife Karen shushes them. Walt looks down weary. He has thin gray hair combed to one side. A young priest, wearing a flowing white surplice, steps up to his lectern beside the altar. Ashley sits texting on her cell phone. The Stars and Stripes flies on a pole outside Walt's modest clapboard house. Inside, the mourners help themselves to food. In the basement, Daniel, David and Josh open a trunk, and look at some war photographs. Steve follows Walt, who wears a permanent frown. Walt heads down to the basement. Tubby, 40-something Steve looks put out. Hearing Walt come down, the boys quickly shut the trunk, rush over to a couch and sit down. Ignoring them, Walt picks up two metal folding chairs, and goes back upstairs. Sitting holding her cell phone, Ashley looks at her mother Karen. Ashley goes over to Walt, who's unfolding the chairs. Ashley rolls her eyes and looks at Karen, who beckons her over. Ashley trudges back to her seat. Walt walks out of the front door with his Golden Labrador. He opens a pouch of chewing tobacco as he goes down the front steps and watches people go into the house next door. Walt pops some tobacco in his mouth. Walt stares at the house, eyes narrowed. He spits and wanders away. Ashley's in the large garage, smoking. Beside her, with its cover partially pulled back is a pristine Ford Gran Torino muscle car. Walt pulls open the garage door and sunlight floods in. Ashley drops the cigarette and blows out smoke.",
    "110": "A large black recruit with a strange look on his face, much like Forrest's, looks up from his seat. Bubba moves his case over, making room for Forrest to sit down. Bubba hands Forrest a handkerchief. Bubba and Forrest shake hands. Bubba's mother, a robust woman in a cook's uniform, carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room. She sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. Bubba's grandmother carries a bowl of shrimp into a dining room. She sets it down on a table in front of a wealthy white man. The Drill Sergeant moves down the line to the next man. The recruits are sitting at the base of their bunks assembling their rifles. Bubba speaks to Forrest. Forrest finishes assembling his rifle as the other recruits are still working on theirs. The Drill Sergeant rushes up to Forrest. The Drill Sergeant looks at his stop watch. The Drill Sergeant walks away as Forrest begins to disassemble his rifle. Bubba continues talking about shrimp in his slow southern drawl. Bubba and Forrest shine their boots. Bubba and Forrest are on their hands and knees as they scrub the floor with toothbrushes. Bubba lies in his bunk and looks up quietly. Forrest lies in his bunk and looks up. A young private tosses a Playboy magazine onto Forrest. Forrest pick up the magazine and turns the page, revealing Jenny as she poses with a school sweater on, and that's all. Forrest looks up with shock. He cranes his head up for a closer look. Forrest, in his army uniform, steps into the foyer of the club. EMCEE steps out onto the stage. The men laugh. Jenny kicks his hand. He yells angrily as he sits back down, then tosses his drink on her. Forrest walks up to Man #5 and grabs him and tosses him down on the ground. Man #4 tries to grab Forrest, but Forrest shoves him down too. Forrest climbs up onto the stage and picks Jenny up, guitar and all, and carries her. Jenny struggles and frees herself from Forrest. Forrest steps back in surprise. Jenny shoves the guitar at Forrest. Jenny walks off as Forrest holds the guitar. He follows after her. Forrest follows Jenny over a bridge outside the night club. Jenny turns and looks over the bridge. Jenny turns and looks at the light of an approaching vehicle. She steps into the street. Jenny runs and flags down the approaching vehicle. A pickup truck pulls over as Jenny looks at the driver. Jenny walks toward Forrest. She looks at the driver. Jenny walks up to Forrest. Jenny takes a last look at Forrest, then climbs into the truck.",
    "1100": "The gang drive up. Thao eyes them suspiciously. The five mean-looking Hmong guys get out. Spider walks over to Thao. Spider ruffles Thao's hair. Sue goes inside. Thao takes off his gardening gloves and stands with Spider and Smokie. Thao looks next door. Thao follows them. The gang spot Walt's car. Walt's in a bar with his buddies. They leave the others at the bar. Walt makes to drink his whiskey but stops short. Walt downs his shot in one. Father J nods. A noise wakes Walt from his slumbers. He looks out of the window and sees torchlight in his garage. He gets up, and goes over to a chest. He opens it and pulls out an old military rifle. He opens the breech and loads a magazine into it, then cocks it. Rifle in hand, Walt edges the garage door open, and walks inside. He sees Thao with a torch beside the Gran Torino. As Walt advances, the barrel of the rifle knocks the overhead light, sending it swinging. By its drunken swaying light, he aims the rifle at Thao, who backs away. Thao stumbles and falls backwards, tripping Walt in the process. The rifle goes off, shooting a sign on the wall. Thao runs out of the garage, leaving Walt sprawling on the ground. He runs to Spider's souped-up Honda in the street. Walt spits out some blood, and pushes himself up. Mitch makes a phone call in his kitchen. Walt is in his garage installing window grills. Walt hangs up. Mitch looks put-out. In his driveway, Walt lovingly polishes his Gran Torino. It's dark green with gold trims. He buffs a wing of the car and works his way around to the bonnet, carefully removing any marks. Evening, Walt sits on his porch with his dog Daisy and lights a cigarette, he looks out at gran torino parked on the drive. A couple of people walk by on the street. Walt swigs from a can of beer. As the light begins to fade and several beers later, he gets to his feet. He calls to his dog as he heads inside. He switches on the porch light as he goes into the house and shuts the door behind him. Night, Spider's Honda pulls up on the street outside Thao's house. Spider and his cronies get out. They approach Thao and his sister Sue sitting on the porch. Spider tousles Thao's hair. Spider hustles Thao towards the car. Family members intervene and a scuffle breaks out. The scuffle spills over onto Walt's lush green lawn and two garden gnomes are broken. Rifle in hand, Walt marches onto the lawn. He aims his gun at the squabbling guys.",
    "1101": "They straighten up. As Smokie stares down the rifle's barrel, he reconsiders. Spider lets go of Thao, and he and his buddies retreat to his car. Walt keeps the gun trained on them as they go. Thao rejoins his family. Walt heads back into his house. Sue, Thao and the others go back to theirs. Walt is at the kitchen sink. Hearing something, he picks his rifle up from beside his cooker, and goes out on to the porch to investigate. He looks surprised to find some of his neighbors laying gifts of food and flowers on his front steps. The Hmongs leave. Walt stares at the platters of food with distaste. He puts them all in the trash. He sees more of his neighbors approaching with gifts. He intercepts Sue and Thao. He looks sheepishly at Walt. Walt marches back to his house. Sue, her mother and Thao get back to theirs. Sue turns back to look at Walt. Father Janovich finds Walt sitting on his porch, smoking his cigarette. Walt gets up. Father Janovich nods slightly. Walt is at the barber's. Sue is with a white boy, Trey. They approach three black youths. As the black guys hassle Sue and Trey, Walt pulls up at the junction in his pickup. Walt watches thoughtfully. Looking uneasy, Walt drives across the junction. Walt pulls up beside them. The black guys notice Walt. Walt steps out of his pickup. Chewing on a plug of tobacco, he squares up to the three black guys. He spits. Walt points his finger like a gun. He cocks his thumb. The guys hold Sue back. Walt pulls a Colt .45 pistol. Trey hurries off and Walt puts his gun away. He turns to the black guys. He turns back to his pickup. Walt looks menacingly back at them. He gets in the truck with Sue in the passenger seat. Walt drives off in a leisurely, unhurried fashion. Walt nods thoughtfully. Walt sits down on his porch with a newspaper. He sees the elderly grandma from next door looking over at him. He picks up his glasses and puts them on to read the paper. He looks down at Daisy. Disgruntled, he looks across the street at a white woman unloading groceries from her car. She drops them. Three passing Hmong youths make no attempt to help her. One of them mimes shagging her. He sits back down as Thao helps the woman. Walt puts his glasses down, and picks up a mug. He takes a drink. Walt looks over at the old lady next door and she gives him a nod. With big buttons. Cigarettes. Walt looks furious. Walt puts away a photo of his wife.",
    "1102": "Sitting on his porch, he looks over at the road, where Sue helps two other women get out of a car. She walks over towards him as he sips from a beer can. He's tempted. They go next door. Walt opens the well stocked fridge. He pats a child's head. Everyone gives him disapproving looks. Sue steers him away. At a buffet table, he looks at the buffet. Sue brings Walt another beer and finds him staring at the elder in ceremonial dress sitting across the room. The old man stares back. She goes over to Kor Khue. They go over to Walt. Walt sits down in a chair, and Kor Khue studies his craggy features. Walt looks thoughtful. Troubled Walt looks up at the diminutive Kor Khue, who nods. Walt gets to his feet, and walks across the room. He looks into the next room, where some women are having tea. Sue watches him as he begins to cough. He coughed up blood onto the back of his hand. He quickly conceals it from Sue and hurries away upstairs. She follows him. Walt disappears into the bathroom and shuts the door behind him. He rinses his face in the basin and regards his reflection in the mirror. He dries his face. He opens the bathroom door. As he sits at the table, women fuss around him and load his plate with food. Sue wanders into the kitchen and finds him tucking in. Very reluctantly he gets up. Sue leads Walt down into the basement, where the younger generations of Hmongs have gathered. Walt looks singularly unimpressed. Sue smiles and goes towards Thao, who sits alone, away from the others. Walt leans against a tumble dryer. It rocks under his weight. He puts his beer down and fiddles about underneath the tumble dryer, adjusting its legs to stabilize it. Some of the youngsters look over at him, on his hands and knees. He notices them looking. He gets back up, pats the drier and leans against it for a moment. Satisfied it's OK, he begins to wander across the basement. He eyes an attractive Hmong girl who's sitting with some boys. Walt notices she keeps glancing over at Thao. Walt drinks from a beer bottle, and walks over to Sue who offers him a glass of clear liquid. He takes a sip and Sue wanders off. Walt puts his beer down and looks back over at the girl sitting with the boys. Walt glances over at Thao sitting on his own, looking miserable. She keeps looking at Thao. The girl gets up and walks up behind Walt. He turns around and sees her. She wanders off and he stares after her.",
    "1104": "Karen hands him the phone. Reluctantly, Mitch answers it. As Mitch hangs up, he looks troubled. Walt stares into the distance with a frown. He looks down at some hospital admission forms and test results. Day, Thao carries a bundle of garden waste out to the front of his house. Walt watches from his porch as Spider's car comes slowly down the street. Thao sees it and goes back into the garden. Walt lights a cigarette, as the modified Honda cruises slowly by. Smokie stares out of the car, and Walt mimes shooting him. Smokie responds by giving him the finger. Thao watches the exchange of gestures. Later Walt opens his front door to Thao. Walt's working under the sink in Thao's kitchen. The ceiling fan gyrates unsteadily. In his garage, Walt works on the fan with Thao. Thao folds his arms. Walt doubles up. Thao sees he's coughed up blood. Thao nods at the Gran Torino. Walt follows his gaze to the green V8 muscle car. Thao nods. Walt grins. Down in his basement, Walt is busy moving an old freezer on a sack truck. He attempts to get it up the stairs, but finds it hard going. He tugs away, then gives it up as a bad job. Thao opens his door to Walt. They go down to Walt's basement. They heave the freezer up the steps. They get it outside. Thao rubs his neck. Sue finds Walt on his back porch, as Thao washes the Gran Torino on the drive. She shrugs, then glances at Thao. She goes to get one. Walt looks over at Thao. Later, he watches Thao working in the garden. Walt gets a cigarette. The lighter. Thao and Walt get out of his pickup truck. They go in the barber shop. Thao goes out, and comes straight back in. A gun. Martin takes a seat. Thao comes back in. Walt and Thao drive up to a building site in Walt's old white Ford pickup. They park up. Work gloves. They leave Tim's portacabin, and Tim sits back down at his desk. Walt's pickup truck pulls up outside C.M. Young Hardware and Lumber Store. Walt and Thao get out. They go inside and look around. Walt makes his way over to a shelf, which has what he's looking for. A tape measure. A tool bag. Walt holds his hand out and Thao shakes it. As they head off, Walt winces slightly. Carrying his new stuff, Thao gets off a bus and jogs down a back alley heading home. As he trots along, he sees Spider's Honda coming the other way. The car pulls up, and Spider and his four cronies get out. Smokie stubs a cigarette out on Thao's cheek.",
    "1107": "An evening sky, the clouds are tinged red by the setting sun. The sun slowly sinks below the horizon. In the sprawling suburbs, the streets grow dark and the lights go on in the rows of houses. A light shines from an upstairs window. In the bedroom, a dark-haired boy wearing round glasses is looking at an unusual photo album. He turns a page. The people in the photographs are moving. They smile at him. He turns to a snowy owl in a padlocked cage. Harry pulls a face. In the kitchen, his Aunt Petunia is decorating a meringue gateau. Uncle Vernon is fastening his son's bow tie. Dudley scowls at Harry knocking into him as he passes. The three of them stare ominously at Harry. Harry goes upstairs as the guests arrive. He finds a small wizened creature with floppy ears and a long pointed nose jumping on his bed. The creature is wearing a filthy rag. Banging his head. Harry's bedroom. Dobby grabs a lamp and hits himself. Uncle Vernon hears the noise upstairs. Vernon leaves. He opens the wardrobe. Dobby has a bundle of letters. Harry chases him downstairs. Dobby stops at the kitchen door. On the table, stands the huge meringue gateau decorated with green and mauve whipped cream and red cherries. Dobby clicks his fingers. The gateau rises into the air. He clicks his finger again. The gateau floats out of the kitchen. Horrified, Harry follows it into the sitting room. The creamy desert hovers over Mrs. Mason. Dobby clicks his fingers. The gateau falls on her head. Mrs. Mason is covered in cake and cream. Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Vernon fixes bars outside Harry's window. Asleep in bed Harry suddenly wakes. Looking puzzled he reaches out for his glasses and puts them on. Getting out of bed, he goes across to the window and stares through the bars at the dark night sky. A faint light appears far away above the roof tops gradually getting nearer. To Harry's surprise, the light becomes two headlights. A blue Ford Anglia with a white roof flies down over the neighboring gardens and hovers outside Harry's window. The lights disturb the snowy owl. Harry stares at the three red head boys in the car. Dressing quickly, Harry packs his trunk. Ron fixes a hook to the bars on the window. The bars on window frame are wrenched away. The Dursleys wake. The car boot flies open and Harry pushes his luggage out into it. Vernon unlocks the padlocks on Harry's door. Harry passes Hedwig's cage to Ron. Harry dives for the window but Vernon grabs his foot. The car zooms away. Vernon falls head first out of the window.",
    "1110": "A spider, bigger than a man's hand, jumps out of the box and scuttles past Harry and off down the corridor. Harry stretches out his hand. A wind seems to draw him away. The door slams shut. Back on Harry's desk, the book opens and glows with light. Harry lands back in his chair. In the school courtyard. They look at each other guiltily. As Hagrid walks towards the school, a boy rushes out past him. They all run to the boys' dormitory and stop in the doorway. The floor is covered with scattered books and papers, broken picture frames and feathers. The mattress and pillows of Harry's four-poster bed have been slashed. Drawers have been emptied out. Hedwig the Snowy Owl sits on the desk as Harry searches through a pile of books on the floor. The Gryffindor team. They head for the pitch. The hospital wing. Madam Pomfrey is standing next to a bed where a petrified girl is lying. Harry and Ron stare with horror at the stiff figure. A hand mirror. Hermione's eyes are wide open and staring. Harry gently strokes her outstretched hand. The Gryffindor common room. She sweeps out. Concerned, the students look at each other. Harry turns to Ron. In Hagrid's cottage at the edge of the dark forest, his dog Fang raises his head. Hagrid picks up his crossbow. He kicks open the door. They take off the cloak. His hand shakes as he pours it out. Ron and Harry hide under the invisibility cloak. Lucius Malfoy opens the door. He steps inside. He stops near the boys under the cloak. Fudge goes to take it but Dumbledore stops him. Dumbledore takes the scroll. Dumbledore stares straight at Harry and Ron. Lucius Malfoy looks around suspiciously. He crosses to the door. Giving the boys one last look, Dumbledore follows him. Fudge looks confused. Fudge stares at the huge dog. They leave. The boys reappear. Lines of spiders are following each other up the wall and out of the window. Harry lifts down heavy lantern. The huge hound follows them outside. They look up at the light from the cottage window. The spiders are crawling down the wall and on to go the ground. Ron watches the spiders nervously as they scuttle after each other away into the forest. Harry starts walking. Ron follows Harry reluctantly. Fang drops ahead as they make their way through the dark night into the gloomy forest. Fang sniffs the ground. They are led deeper into the shadowy forest. Terrified of spiders. Ron walks on his toes trying not to trade on them. Harry ignores him and keeps on walking. Harry stops and holds up the lantern. The spiders have led them to the mouth of a large tunnel dug into the sandy soil under the roots of a tree.",
    "1112": "Steadying itself, the car flies high over the tops of the tall trees. It zooms over the forest and lands heavily on the grass beside Hagrid's cottage. They stagger out. The battered car starts itself. It reverses, changes direction, and drives away past Hagrid's cottage disappearing into the trees at the edge of the dark forest. The sun rises behind the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School. In the hospital wing, Harry puts some fresh flowers on the table by Hermione's bed. He and Ron sit sadly beside their petrified friend. Harry gently strokes her hand. He notices something clutched in her clenched fingers. A crumpled piece of paper. A page from a book. Harry looks puzzled for a moment. Then he spots his reflection in the window. Harry reads from the page again. Harry and Ron hide in the second floor corridor where the teachers are gathering. Lockhart swaggers up. Lockhart swallows nervously. He hurries away. Harry and Ron look horrified. The worried teachers leave. Ron reads out the message written in blood on the wall. They run to Lockhart's room. Lockhart is packing. He grabs his wand. The boys point their wands at him. He drops his. The girls' lavatory. Myrtle spots the three of them coming in. She points across the room and floats away. Harry crosses to the ring of sinks which are set around the base of an ornate marble structure. He looks up and runs his hand along the ledge above. He twists the tap. He notices a raised decoration on the side of it. A copper snake. He runs his finger over it. Lockhart looks aghast. Staring at the tiny snake, Harry concentrates hard. He opens his mouth and speaks. They all step back as the heavy top of the structure rises into the air. The sinks around the base divide and move out towards away from each other. The sink decorated with the snake slowly disappears downwards. As it reaches the ground, a heavy metal grill slides over it. It uncovers a deep shaft. Lockhart looks down into it, then backs away. They grab him. He almost falls down the shaft. He stares down the shaft. Ron gives him a push and Lockhart disappears. They stare down after him. Harry jumps, quickly followed by Ron. The shaft becomes a smooth pipe. They slide down it and fall onto a floor covered with animal bones. They point their wands at Lockhart, who is covered in dirt. Ron notices the bones on the ground. Ron makes Lockhart follow Harry through a huge pipe. The pipe leads to a low cave where something scaly is lying on the ground. Lockhart faints. Leaping up, Lockhart grabs Ron's wand.",
    "1113": "Lockhart flies upwards, hits the roof of the cave and falls. The cave roof starts to collapse. The passage between Ron and Harry is completely blocked. Harry peers through a tiny gap in the rocks. Lying on the ground, Lockhart smiles vacantly. He picks up a stone. Ron grabs the stone and hits him over the head with it. Harry climbs over fallen rocks. Holding his wand in his hand, he starts to explore the cave. On the wall ahead, he sees a circular hinged door decorated with a pattern of snakes. He goes towards it, and starts to speak. One snake glides around the circumference, unlocking the mechanism. The heavy metal door swings open. Holding his wand as protection, Harry walks warily through the circular opening of the long and narrow tunnel. He climbs down the few rungs of a short metal ladder and jumps off at the bottom. He finds himself in a long, damp chamber. Ahead of him runs a wide paved path lined on either side by huge carved snake heads. Their stone mouths gaping open. Harry walks towards the massive carved head of a bearded man illuminated with a green light. The head is reflected in the water beneath. He sees the still figure of a girl lying on the wet stone floor. He runs towards her and kneels beside her. Her face is pale and her eyes are closed. Harry looks around and sees Tom Riddle in the shadows. He picks up Harry's wand. Harry gets up and holds out his hand. He writes fiery letters in the air with Harry's wand. Harry stares at him. They glare angrily at each other. They both look up. The phoenix drops something into Harry's hand. The handsome bird sweeps away down the chamber. Harry unrolls the crumpled sorting hat. And looks at it in surprise. Riddle stretches out his hand. The mouth of the huge bearded statue starts to open. Harry watches in fascinated horror as the huge stone mouth opens wider and wider. A gigantic serpent slithers out. Harry drops the hat and runs. The serpent splashes through the water beneath the statue. It slithers ominously after Harry. Who trips and falls. Harry cowers, protecting his head. As the serpent prepares to strike. Fawkes suddenly reappears. The Phoenix flies at the serpent's head flapping its wings the brave bird pecks repeatedly at the other creature's huge yellow eyes. Riddle calls out angrily. Fawkes swoops off. Harry scrambles to his feet. He backs away as the serpent threshes his head. The serpent feels his footsteps and lunges forward. Harry makes a dash for it. He splashes through a shallow pool with huge serpent heads after him.",
    "1116": "Vernon lands flat on his back in a bush. He scrambles to his feet and stares angrily after the car as it disappears into the night sky. From the back seat, Ron smiles at his friend. The suburbs are left far behind. As day breaks, the car reaches open countryside. It sweeps down over green fields and trees towards a ramshackle house beside a lake. The car touches down on a narrow sandy track and bumps along it past an outhouse. Two pale pink pigs look up curiously from their sty. Harry's eyes are wide with amazement. The three brothers unlock the door and creep stealthily into the house. Harry looks around the kitchen with delight. A pan scrubber cleans a frying pan which holds itself under a running tap. Ron grabs a bun. Next to an armchair, a pair of needles hang in mid-air knitting a multi-colored garment. A young girl. Embarrassed the girl disappears upstairs. Mr. Weasley joins them at the table. An old grey owl flaps wearily towards the house and hits the window. Percy takes an envelope from the owl's beak. Beside the fireplace. Wearing his school cloak, Ron steps into the fireplace and takes a handful of powder. Ron disappears in a flash of green flames. Harry steps forward nervously. Harry takes a handful of powder. Standing in the fireplace, Harry takes a deep breath. Harry disappears in a flash of green flames. Mrs. Weasley looks confused. Harry shoots out of the fireplace onto a dusty wooden floor. He is streaked with soot and ash. He picks up his glasses and puts them on. One of the lenses is broken. He gets up slowly and looks around the gloomy shop. At the glass cabinets covered in cobwebs. They are all piled high with shrunken heads and skulls of all shapes and sizes. Cautiously, he moves towards a shelf and taps idly on a glass dome. Beside it, a skeletal hand with bony black fingers is mounted on a piece of marble. Harry puts his fingers around the bony thumb. The hand suddenly closes, clutching him tightly. He struggles desperately to free himself from its ghastly grip. The hand releases him, and he hurries across the shop towards the open door which leads out into the alley. Outside, he finds himself in a damp, dingy passageway. He passes a suspicious looking man lurking in the shadows. Suddenly, a sharp faced witch with a pointed hat grabs him by the arm. He is surrounded. He is terrified. Harry runs towards Hagrid. A giant with bushy hair and a huge black beard. In Diagon Alley, a girl with long wavy hair comes out of a shop and spots them.",
    "1118": "The car heads straight towards the ground. They both wrestle with the gear stick. Ron waves his wand desperately. It snaps. The car heads towards an ancient willow tree standing in the school grounds. It plunges onto the top branches. High in the tree, the car rocks precariously. It falls backwards, but gets stuck halfway down. Ron holds up his broken wand. Hefty willow branches attack the car. The vehicle rocks and the windscreen shatters. A branch smashes through the back window. Branches attack from all angles. They are showered with broken glass. The car suddenly tips forward, bounces from branch to branch, and falls towards the ground. It lands on the grass. Ron presses the accelerator and the car zooms away. The tree lunges after them, but they escape its clutching branches. Clear of the angry willow, the boys breath a sigh of relief. Suddenly, the car doors fly open and they are hurled out onto the grass. The boot opens and throws out their trunks and luggage. Harry catches Hedwig's cage, and Ron peers anxiously at his pet rat. The car starts. The doors shut and the battered car drives itself across the grass towards a stone archway. Harry and Ron race after it. It rolls down a cobbled passageway and zooms away towards the forest, leaving Ron and Harry far behind. Later, they haul their luggage into school and leave it on the landing. They run upstairs. Filch, the caretaker, with his cat, Mrs. Norris, is standing at the top of the stairs. Hogwarts School is housed in a handsome castle surrounded by stone outbuildings and long Victorian greenhouses. In one of these, a class of students stand waiting around a long bench filled with rows of potted plants. A short, plump woman with curly, gray hair in a brown smock and a matching tall, pointed hat comes in. She's wearing a pair of earmuffs. The root looks like an ugly baby. They cover their ears. A boy collapses. They pull out the screaming roots. Showing off, Draco Malfoy pokes his finger into his Mandrake's mouth. It bites him. Furious, he throws it into a pot. Later, in the corridor. The ghost of Sir Nicolas floats into the Great Hall where the students are sitting at long tables. Ron is trying unsuccessfully to mend his broken wand with sticky tape. A boy takes a photograph. A tatty gray owl flies down into the room. Swooping low over the table, it heads for Ron, but collides with a bowl, scattering crisps everywhere. Draco and his cronies snigger. Ron takes a red envelope from Errol's beak. Ron nervously breaks the seal on the red envelope. To his embarrassment, it starts to scream at him.",
    "1121": "Chasing after Harry the Bludger crashes through the towers, one by one. Harry swoops lower to the grass, but the Bludger follows him closely. Draco watches, a smug expression on his face. The Bludger crashes through another tower. Harry flies back over the arena to see Draco hovering in front of him. Harry suddenly sees the Golden Snitch beside Draco's head. They both duck as the Bludger hurtles past. Then Harry heads for the Snitch, closely followed by Draco who elbows him out of the way. Draco takes the lead. The Snitch disappears under the wooden scaffolding supporting the spectators' stands. Draco flies after it, closely followed by Harry who swerves to avoid a solid wooden beam. The Snitch is too fast for Draco's grasping fingers. Harry is still being chased by the heavy wooden Bludger. Determined to stay ahead, Draco grits his teeth. He looks around in dismay as Harry catches him up and gradually overtakes. Now, close behind Draco, the heavy Bludger crashes into the wooden beams. They weave over and under the wooden struts. Draco catches up again and bashes Harry in the ribs. They fly neck and neck, the Snitch just out of reach. They flash past Colin with his camera. He ducks. The Bludger flies over his head and smashes through a wooden support. Harry takes the lead again, the Bludger streaks past them both and weaves from side to side in front of them, smashing holes in the sides of the structure. Suddenly, it turns and hurtles back towards them. Draco's broomstick catches on a wooden strut. He somersaults into the air and lands heavily on the grass of the arena. Harry is still pursuing the Golden Snitch. As he stretches out his hand to grasp it, a rogue Bludger smashes into his arm. Wincing with pain, he grasps his broomstick between his knees. He stretches out his good hand and grabs the Snitch. Then he overbalances, falls off, and lands on his back on the soft sand beneath the goal post. His friends rush to join him. The Bludger hits the sand beside Harry. Hermione's spell works. The Bludger explodes in mid air. Everyone runs towards Harry. Lockhart pushes up Harry's sleeve. Ron and Hagrid look alarmed. Harry's arm goes completely limp and floppy. He folds the wrist back on its self. The hospital wing. He drinks some medicine. Late at night, Harry is lying fast asleep when a strange noise wakes him. He opens his eyes and sits up. He looks around, but the room seems empty. Harry puts on his glasses and sees a figure sitting at the end of his bed. His fingers are covered in bandages. Dobby jumps down.",
    "1122": "Harry gets out of bed. He covers his eyes. He blows his nose on his filthy garment. He hits his head with the medicine bottle. Harry grabs him. Dobby clicks his fingers and disappears. Harry jumps back into bed as shadows appear in the doorway. A patient is carried in on a stretcher. The patient is lifted carefully onto a bed. Professor Dumbledore takes the camera from Colin Creevey's stiff fingers and opens the back. The film explodes. Hermione prepares a potion. A ghostly girl in school uniform shouts in Ron's face, then hovers high above their heads. She zooms into a cubicle and dives head first down the lavatory pan. In the Great Hall, a long platform has been erected. Lockhart strides along it. He tosses his cloak to a group of excited girls. Snape steps onto the platform. Snape and Lockhart draw their wands and solemnly salute each other. They bow and turn. Each takes a few steps away. Then they turn again and face each other. Lockhart hurtles backwards down the platform. He gets painfully to his feet. He beckons to Draco who steps forward. Looking worried, Lockhart passes Harry. Grim faced, Harry and Draco approach each other. They stand face to face. Draco glares. They salute each other, then turn and walk away. The watching students hold their breath in anticipation. Harry and Draco face each other along the platform. Harry is somersaulted backwards. Draco smirks at his cronies as Harry scrambles up and points his wand. Draco's smile fades. Draco is spun in the air. As he crashes onto the platform, Snape hauls him to his feet and pushes him back towards Harry. Draco points his wand. A large snake appears in front of Harry. It uncoils itself and moves towards him. He backs away. The snake flies into the air, then falls again. It raises its head menacingly. Harry moves slowly towards it and starts to speak. The snake fixes its gaze on a boy in the crowd. Harry speaks again. The snake moves closer to the boy who backs away. Harry speaks again. The snake turns its head, staring at Harry and closes its mouth. The snake is reduced to ashes. Harry frowns. He looks around the hall to find everyone staring at him. Harry runs into the Gryffindor Common Room followed by Ron and Hermione. He looks from one to the other. In a classroom, students are working quietly at long tables. Harry looks up from his books to see two girls staring at him curiously. He glances across at Ron and Hermione, who both give him an embarrassed smile. A group of students at another table look away quickly as he turns towards them.",
    "1123": "Even Ginny Weasley refuses to catch his eye. Harry puts down his quill and closes his book. He gets up from the table and puts his books under his arm. He senses that all the students are staring at him as he quickly walks out of the room. In the corridor, Harry hears the disembodied voice again. He follows the sound. Harry looks around nervously. Taking a deep breath, he walks slowly around a corner and stops at the horrible sight ahead of him. Lit by flaming torchlight, he sees the ghost of Nearly Headless Nick hanging stiffly in mid-air, and a boy, Justin, lying petrified on the ground, his eyes wide open, his arms stuck out in front of him. Harry kneels beside Justin and touches his stiff fingers. Filch the caretaker appears stealthily behind him. Still kneeling beside the petrified Justin, Harry notices a line of spiders quickly scuttling across the floor. They follow each other up the wall, over the stone windowsill, and out of the open window. As Harry watches them go, Filch returns with Professor McGonagall. She hurries along the corridor towards Harry and regards the scene with horror. She walks briskly away. Harry follows her towards an archway with a fiery torch burning on each side. Filling the archway is a huge stone statue of a griffin, with the head and outstretched wings of an eagle and the body of a lion. Harry steps towards it. Professor McGonagall spreads her long fingers and points them at the statue. It slowly turns, and Harry steps onto the circular staircase behind it. As the griffin continues to revolve, Harry is gradually carried upwards. At the top, he steps off and walks down a passage towards a large wooden door. A cluttered, circular room lined with glass cabinets. The walls hung with moving portraits of elderly wizards. The heavy wooden door swings open, and Harry peers cautiously inside. Harry walks up some steps into a smaller room lined with shelves of old books. On one of the shelves high above his head, he catches sight of a patched and shabby pointed hat. As he stares at the crumpled hat, it starts to speak. The hat scowls. Harry turns as he hears a faint sound. Behind him, a decrepit bird with tatty orange feathers is balancing on a perch. Harry moves towards the bird and smiles at the odd-looking creature. To his dismay, it suddenly bursts into flames. Harry takes a step back. The bird becomes a pile of ash below its perch. Dumbledore appears at the top of a flight of stairs. A tiny head pokes out from the pile of black ash. The baby bird opens its beak.",
    "1125": "He picks up the radio. Outside of the clearing, Hermione tip-toes towards the invisible, protective shield. Her eyes peeled, she gazes into the gloom. Narrowing her eyes, she peers towards the dark shadows under the trees. In the tent, Harry studies the Marauder's Map. Snape's footprints appear near the headmaster's study. Hermione continues to prowl. She freezes as men approach, one carrying a woman. He passes by. A second man follows with someone slung over his shoulder. A third stops, just past Hermione. He retraces his steps, until he stands directly in front of her. She stands stalk still. He can see no sign of her, the tent, or the campfire. The second man drops the body from his shoulder. The man does as he's told. The three of them walk away. Harry joins Hermione. Hermione looks in the direction the men went. Her face is solemn. They walk towards the tent. Ron steps out of the tent. He sees the two of them together. He looks pale and haggard. As they journey through fields and past devastated homes, Ron grows more drawn and suspicious. They're camped under a bridge. Harry stands alone a little distance from them. Ron stays glued to the radio. Now, they're camped on the shore of a lake. At night, Ron lies awake. In the tent, Hermione is cutting Harry's hair. She stops suddenly. She consults a book. The light whisks away from the lamps. Hollow-eyed, Ron appears holding the deluminator. He returns the light. Harry lunges at him. The two friends glare at each other. Ron tugs off the locket and throws it down. Ron picks up his bag and scowls at Hermione. She looks distraught. She glances round at Harry, then back to Ron. She hesitates. Ron glowers at Harry. His mouth curled in a snarl, Ron storms out. Hermione follows. Harry paces uneasily. His face troubled, Harry remains alone inside the tent. Next morning, Harry steps out of the tent and sees Hermione standing by the water's edge, her back to him. She gazes anxiously across the wintry landscape. Harry waits as Hermione ties her scarf round a slender tree trunk. The locket dangles from her hand. She walks through dead bracken and stands beside Harry. He takes her hand. They apparate on a stony clifftop. Hermione sadly wipes her eyes. Harry moves away discreetly as she turns to hide her tears. High on the limestone clifftop, he creates a protective shield. Hermione sits huddled on a flat-topped rock. Harry stands alone, looking towards the setting sun. A dim light glows inside the tent. The wind ruffles Harry's hair as he walks over the rocks. He turns, hearing the faint sound of the radio.",
    "1126": "The tiny tent is spacious inside. Harry sits beside a table piled with camping equipment. Hermione crouches by a bunk bed, listening to the radio. Harry leans back in his chair, deep in thought. Her knees drawn up to her chest, Hermione stares blankly at Ron's radio. He crosses over to her. He holds out a hand. Her face solemn, she takes both his hands and pulls herself up. Harry puts his arms around her neck. He unfastens the locket. He throws it onto the lower bunk. His eyes fixed on hers, he draws her away from the radio. She looks pale and wistful. Still holding her hands, Harry starts to move to the music. They twist back and forth and she half-smiles. Hermione grins and they start to move a little more imagistically. He spins around. They both smile and spin. He puts his arm around her, they dance more closely. They hold their hands again. Laughing they start to jive. Hermione spins into his arms. Harry leans his head against her. She rests her chin on his shoulder. They turn slowly, holding each other close. Hermione's smile fades. They stop dancing. They meet each other's gaze. Hermione sighs and walks away. Harry watches her go. Hermione sits reading on the flat-topped rocks. Inside the tent, Harry lies on a bunk. His arms folded, idly watching the snitch hovering above his head. He reaches out his hand. The fluttering wings slow then fold away. Harry draws the snitch down and holds it against his mouth. He looks at it. Writing appears on the golden surface. I open at the close. He hands it to her. She puts down her book and studies the writing. Harry sits beside her. A triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She frowns at the drawing. She ruffles his hair, and smiles at him. Harry nods and grins after her, as she walks away. A few snowflakes drift past. They apparate in a quaint, snow covered village. Wearing winter clothes, they wander down a deserted street. She takes his arm. Two villagers come out of an inn behind them. A little gate leads into the churchyard. She turns to him. In the graveyard, surrounding the church. Harry and Hermione, study the name on the graves. The snow gently falls. Hermione stops at a grave marked with a horizontal slab. She brushes snow from it with her gloved hand. Carved on the slab, is a triangle containing a circle, with a vertical line through it. She wipes away more snow, and finds a name engraved underneath. He is standing at the far side of the graveyard. He looks down at a plain, upright gravestone.",
    "1131": "Lying on the ground, Ron lowers his head. Scabior scrutinizes Harry's disfigured face. Harry's face is bloated, and his right eye is closed. Scabior grips his collar. The path towards the Malfoy Manor house. Scabior releases his hold as they near the gate. Hermione and Ron are close behind, each escorted by a Snatcher. Bellatrix Lestrange waits eagerly behind the iron gate. Scabior pulls back Harry's fringe to reveal the scar on his forehead. Bellatrix has Harry on his knees in front of the Malfoys. She looks expectantly at Draco. Narcissa Malfoy pulls Lucius back. She points at Hermione. She spots the Sword of Gryffindor. A Snatcher holds it. She's hurled backwards. Her wand shoots out a snake which twists round Greyback's neck. A whip coils around Scabior. She drags him along the floor. Scabior and Greyback stagger away. Bellatrix grabs Ron. Peter Pettigrew, Wormtail, locks Harry and Ron in a cellar. They run to the gate and clutch the bars. A figure emerges from the gloom of the vast, crypt-like cellar. Ron's deluminator lights a lantern. Hermione is pinned to the floor. Bellatrix sticks her wand in Hermione's arm. Ollivander, the wand-maker. Harry holds the piece of broken mirror. He looks into the mirror and sees someone else's eye. Ron's deluminator absorbs the light as Wormtail returns. He points his wand at the goblin, Griphook, who stands beside Ollivander. Griphook walks towards the gate, he looks back, then climbs the stairs. Ron flicks on the delimunator. As the light returns, a small figure apparates. Dobby stands between Luna and Ollivander and takes their hands. The three disapparate. The cellar is dark. Wormtail opens the gate. He is struck from behind. He falls on his face. Dobby waits holding Wormtail's wand. The Snitch flies to Harry from a fallen Snatcher. A strand of hair falls onto Hermione's coat. Bellatrix cuts Griphook with a dagger. She looks down at Hermione. Ron with a wand. Harry catches Bellatrix's wand and aims at Lucius. Bellatrix has Hermione. Her dagger's at Hermione's throat. Bellatrix grins. Harry's back to normal. Lucius glares at Draco, who freezes. With a sneer, his father pulls up his own shirt sleeve to reveal the Dark Mark tattoo on his arm. Lucius raises his right hand, about to lay it on the mark. Bellatrix presses the dagger against Hermione's throat. They all look up. High above, Dobby unscrews a chandelier. Hermione runs into Ron's arms. Harry snatches the wands from Draco and stuns Lucius. He magics Narcissa's wand away. Dobby stands on a balustrade, his arms outstretched. The trio and Griphook with the Sword of Gryffindor grab hold of him. Bellatrix flings her dagger towards them as they disapparate. The dagger vanishes with them.",
    "1137": "Ron peaks around a corner. Across the street behind Ron, Harry stands inside a small doorway. A woman in a neat business suit approaches. Ron pretends to tie his shoelace. Harry casts a spell. The woman faints. Ron helps Harry to carry her inside. They place her beside two unconscious men. Hermione plucks a hair from the woman's head. They each hold a cup of Polyjuice. Harry, now morphed into Albert Runcorn, a man with dark hair. He peeks out the door and steps out. He's followed by Ron, now, a tall man with auburn hair and a mustache, Reginald Cattermole. Then, by Hermione as the business woman, Mafalda Hopkirk. Inside, Harry and Ron minus Hermione join the men. The men are standing in lines outside cubicles. An older man pushes past. Ron enters a cubicle. Harry waits for the next one. He enters his cubicle. He shuts the door. He looks up to see Ron, now Reg. He's peering over the dividing wall. Harry looks at the pedestal, then at Ron. Ron frowns. Harry stands on the edge of the toilet. He steps onto the bowl. He pulls the chain. He's flushed spinning down the loo. He emerges in a green fireplace. He steps out into a long tiled corridor. Ron emerges further back along the corridor. Everyone is walking in the same direction. Ron and Harry join them. Ahead, Harry sees guards in uniform. Two guards apprehend a man walking behind him. He joins a nervous-looking Hermione, both in their morphed shapes of Mafalda and Albert. A statue shows muggles being crushed. Ron has joined them. They enter a lift. Yaxley a Death Eater with a fair pigtail addresses Ron. Yaxley walks away. The gate closes. The lift hurtles backwards, then the shoots up. The gate slides open. Harry pushes Ron out. Ron stands in a circular atrium. The lift reverses. Then it descends. Two men scuttle across in front of him. The gate opens onto Umbridge. She steps in. She turns to Harry. With stiff robotic movements, Harry gets out of the lift. The gate closes. Harry looks round at Hermione. The lift backs away and descends. Harry wanders along a curved corridor. In a large open plan office clerks with wands flick copies of a booklet from their desks into trays. He passes with a herd of minions carrying papers. An eyeball rotates in a peephole. Harry glances around. Then he drops a small black object onto the floor. It develops legs and feet. It scuttles away. It multiplies as it goes. Each one produces a horn and a white up-key on the top. They scatter among the desks in the open plan office. They erupt causing a diversion.",
    "1143": "A merman prepares to attack. Cedric appears. A transparent, bubble of air over his mouth and nose, he frees Cho with his wand. The merman is scared off. Cedric taps his watch. Harry nods and draws his wand to release Hermione, but a sharp, pointed trident is held at his throat. Harry turns as the open mouth of a grinning shark looms towards him. The shark has human legs and arms and wears red shorts. It flashes past, bites through the rope, and swims off with Hermione. Harry takes a firm grip on Ron's arm. He looks at the girl with long, fair hair, now, floating alone. Harry looks cautiously at the merpeople hiding in the weeds. He uses his wand to release the little girl. Eight minutes to 12. Cedric and Cho are the first to the surface. They swim ashore. Dumbledore and Crouch hurriedly descend the stairs of the pavilion. Hermione appears on the surface with the shark. Immediately, its head transforms into Viktor Krum. Wrapped in a dressing gown, Fleur watches the water anxiously. As Harry struggles towards the surface with Ron and the little girl, he notices his hands are no longer webbed. He's suddenly attacked from below, a horde of vicious little squid-like grindylows with sharp teeth and many legs nip at his ankles. He tries to kick them away. He releases his grip on Ron and the little girl and pushes them up towards the surface. Harry clutches his neck. Hundreds of the creatures attack him. He's almost suffocated by their tentacles. Struggling to fight them off, he pulls out his wand. Sparks fly, stunning the grindylows and sending them flying in all directions. Harry sinks to the bottom. Twelve o'clock. Ron and the little girl bob to the surface. Fleur leans out over the water and stretches out her hand. His gills now gone, Harry drifts helplessly. He looks up at the patch of light above his head and with the last desperate effort, raises his wand. He rockets out of the water onto the landing stage, gasping for air. Fleur kisses Harry. She kisses Ron. She wraps a towel around him. Dumbledore puts his wand to his throat. Karkaroff is furious. Harry is with Crouch. Wild-haired Moody glares at Crouch with his mad, rolling eye and flickers his tongue. Crouch stares back into Moody's scarred face, then walks away looking confused. Moody swigs from his hip flask. In the forest at night. Harry sees a black hat lying on the ground. He clutches the scar in his forehead. A man lies on his back among the fallen leaves heaped-in and lifeless. Harry approaches Professor Dumbledore's room. The door is closed. Moody opens the door.",
    "1147": "Red light streams from Harry's wand, green light from Voldemort's. The power from their wands collides and meets like molten lava in a burst of bright flame. Sparks fly as they struggle desperately to overcome each other. Harry controls his quivering wand with both hands. Voldemort's face is twisted with hatred. Streaks of light burst all around, illuminating the dark sky. The ghostly images of Voldemort's victims appear. First Cedric, then Bryce, the old caretaker, killed in the mansion. Harry's father and mother appear at his side. His father speaks. Breaking the connection, Harry grabs Cedric. The cup flies into his hand. Voldemort howls with frustration. Harry lands with Cedric in the arena. The spectators go wild. Fleur senses that something is wrong. Dumbledore gets up. He tries to pull Harry away. Harry clings to Cedric's body. Mr. Diggory bursts through the spectators. He weeps over Cedric's body. Moody pulls Harry up. Moody helps Harry away. The students stand, stunned into silence. Still in a state of shock, Harry walks into Professor Moody's room. Moody slides shut the iron lock on the heavy wooden door. Harry stands in a trance, pale and shaking, clutching his arm. His clothes are torn. His face is bloody. Moody pulls up a stool and sits him down in front of the fire. Harry's deep gash is revealed. He grips Harry's arm. Moody's face twists with agony. Moody opens his hip flask but finds it empty. He runs into the next room and searches feverishly among bottles in a wooden box. They are all empty. Moody stands in the doorway behind him. He searches the shelves. He glares at Harry with his mad eye. Grabbing Harry's arm, he sucks Harry's blood from his fingers. The door bursts open, and Moody is flung hard against the stone wall. Dumbledore grabs him. Snape pours truth serum into Moody's mouth. Moody looks towards the locked trunk. Snape points his wand. The lid flies open. Then six more trunks open, one inside the other. Dumbledore, Snape, and McGonagall peer into the trunk, down a deep shaft. A figure with one leg and one eye lies far below. Snape sniffs the flask. They turn and watch his face and body start to twist with the violent convulsions. He wrenches off the leather patch with the mad, rolling eye, and flings it down. He transforms into a younger man, who lashes out angrily. It's Mr. Crouch's son. He lunges at Harry. Barty reveals the dark mark. Dumbledore uncovers Harry's wound. Snape presses his wand hard against Barty's cheek. Barty narrows his eyes and flickers out his tongue. The entire school is assembled in the great hall. Dumbledore finds Harry packing his case in the boys' bedroom.",
    "1148": "Harry smiles. As evening falls, they join the excited crowds in the magnificent Quidditch stadium. The spectators take their seats in the stands, many of them wearing colorful national costumes. He stops Harry with his walking stick. He smacks at Harry. Spotlight beams illuminate the packed stands. Hermione and the twins wear green and white scarves. Mr. Diggory takes them to the highest level of the stadium. The seven Irish players zoom out in formation. Green and white smoke streaming from their broomsticks. Fireworks explode in the shape of a spiritedly Leprechaun dancing a jig. The opposing team in black and red fly high above the pitch. One turns a somersault. A gigantic image of the handsome Bulgarian player is projected on to the towering stands. He hovers in front of a waving flag proclaiming the name Krum. Krum raises his fist confidently. Cornelius Fudge uses his wand to amplify his voice. A bright ball of light springs from his wand, and plunges down towards the arena. Back in the tent, George and friends celebrate the Irish victory. Mr. Weasley lights a lamp. Mr. Weasley hurries them out of the tent. The camp is in chaos. Many of the tents are on fire. The flames leaping high into the darkness. Harry sees ominous cloaked figures with skeleton masks and tall pointed hats, carrying flaming torches. He starts to run. Wrestled away from Hermione and the others, Harry dodges through the panicking crowd. In the confusion, Harry trips and falls. As he struggles to get up, flying feet knock him aside. Light from the burning tents flickers across his face, as he lies unconscious on the muddy ground. Everything goes black. A full moon shines down on the devastated camp. A lone figure strides between the smoking tents, kicking the smoldering remains. The figure points a wand into the dark sky and casts a spell. A huge, ghostly, green skull appears, with a snake emerging from its mouth. It floats above his head. The young man bears his teeth with an evil smile of satisfaction. Harry slowly regains consciousness and sits up. He sees the shadowy figure approaching through the smoke. Harry gets to his feet and runs away from the dark figure. The figure runs off. Seeing the skull, Harry clutches his scar. A group of ministry wizards. They gaze up nervously at the ghostly skull, a dark mark still hovering above their heads. Ron counts his money. Harry nods to a young Chinese girl. She gives him a shy smile. Harry scratches his eye brow. Hermione leans forward. Harry addresses an envelope to his godfather, Sirius Black. He puts the letter in to Hedwig's beak. The snowy owl flies out of the train window, and soars away over a lake, as the Express steams on towards Hogwarts.",
    "115": "Neff sits before the dictaphone. Neff comes through the reception room doors with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He walks towards his office, but half way there he runs into Keyes. Keyes is wearing his vest and hat, no coat. He is carrying a file of papers and smoking a cigar. He stops by a majolica jar full of sand and takes a pencil from his vest. He stands over the jar extinguishing his cigar carefully so as not to damage it. Keyes puts the half-smoked cigar into his vest pocket with the pencil. They move on. They stop at a door lettered in embossed chromium letters: EDWARD S.NORTON, JR.PRESIDENT. Keyes opens the door. They go in. As Keyes and Neff enter, the door to Norton's private office is opened. From inside, Mr. Norton is letting out three legal looking gentlemen. Norton is about forty-five, very well groomed, rather pompous in manner. He sees Keyes and Neff. Neff has put down his hat and briefcase. He and Keyes pass the legal looking men and follow Norton into his office. Naturally it is the best office in the building; modern but not modernistic, spacious, very well furnished; flowers, smoking stands, easy chairs, etc. Norton has gone behind his desk. Keyes has come in, and Neff after him closes the door quietly. Norton looks disapprovingly at Keyes' shirt sleeves. Norton smiles frostily. Keyes and Neff sit down, Norton remains standing. He walks up and down behind his desk thinking hard. There is a charged pause. He looks from Keyes to Neff and back to Keyes. The dictograph on his desk buzzes. He reaches over and depresses a key and puts the earpiece to his ear. He replaces the earpiece. He turns back to Keyes and Neff. Keyes and Neff start to get up. The secretary has opened the door. Neff stands staring at the door. He relaxes with an obvious effort of will. Phyllis comes in. She wears a gray tailored suit, small black hat with a veil, black gloves, and carries a black bag. The secretary closes the door behind her. Mr. Norton goes to meet her. He turns a little towards Keyes. Norton has placed a chair. Phyllis sits. Phyllis nods silently. Neff, behind him, stands leaning against the false mantel, completely dead-pan. She looks towards Neff. Neff is staring straight at Phyllis. Their eyes meet for a fraction of a second. She makes as if to rise indignantly. She turns and walks out. The door closes after her. There is a pregnant pause. Keyes stands up. He grabs the glass of water out of Norton's hand and drains it in one big gulp. Norton is watching him almost stupefied.",
    "1151": "Dumbledore reads the name written on it. Viktor punches the air. His friends congratulate him. He rises from his seat and shakes Dumbledore by the hand. He leaves the hall. The flame flares again. Dumbledore reads a second piece of smoldering parchment. Beaming with pleasure, Fleur shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Victor. Smiling broadly, he shakes Dumbledore's hand and follows Victor and Fleur out of the hall. Crouch uncovers a magnificent crystal and silver trophy. Snape steps forward alarmed as the goblet of fire flares once more. Dumbledore turns in surprise as the blue flame leaps high into the air. The flame turns red. Karkaroff glares. Sparks fly from a piece of scorched parchment. It flutters down into Dumbledore's hand. He reads it up. All eyes turn to Harry, who sits down nervously. Hagrid shakes his head. Hermione forces Harry to his feet. Ron glowers as Henry walks hesitantly towards Professor Dumbledore. The piece of parchment is still smoking at the edges. Dumbledore thrusts it into Harry's hand. Looking stunned, Harry walks the length of the hall, uncomfortably aware of unfriendly looks from his fellow students. Snape narrows his eyes as Harry passes him. Professor McGonagall pats his shoulder reassuringly. Mad-Eye Moody gives him a hard stare. A pair of iron gates opens in front of Harry. The other three competitors look surprised to see him. Dumbledore bursts into the room, followed by Karkaroff, Snape, Crouch, Moody, Professor McGonagall, and Madame Maxime. Dumbledore grabs Harry. Every eye in the room is focused on Harry. He swallows nervously. Outside, rain pours from the mouth of a gargoyle. In a high tower, the Hogwarts professors meet and consult together. Professor McGonagall looks anxiously at Dumbledore. He puts his wand to his temple. A thread of memory drifts into a bowl. A parchment with Harry's name surfaces. Harry sits on his bed. Ron hangs a wet towel beside the stove. Ron climbs into his four-poster bed. Ron turns his back. Harry scrambles into bed. Ron looks across at him. Harry takes off his glasses and pulls up the covers. Ron lies awake, his face buried in his pillow. The competitors pose for a photo. She looks at Harry. In a tiny room, a green quill hovers over a notebook. Rita pushes Harry inside. The quill writes. She winks at him. Harry gestures to the quill. A small black owl swoops over Hogwarts School. It heads towards a tall, isolated tower. Harry is waiting in the owlery as the black owl flies in through the window. He takes the note from its beak, unfolds it eagerly, and reads. Harry sucks his pecked finger. On Saturday night, he hurries down into the Gryffindor common room.",
    "1153": "In the competitors' tent, Harry sits alone in nervous trepidation. Cedric swallows hard and takes a deep breath. Filch fires the cannon by mistake. Harry walks out into a circular arena hewn from the rocky hillside and surrounded by a stone wall. High in the wooden terraces, Ron and Hermione stand amongst the cheering spectators. Harry resembles a gladiator in a Roman Arena. He glances around cautiously. Harry moves towards a gleaming golden egg standing amongst the gray rocks. He is knocked off his feet by the force of the dragon's tail. The dragon's massive head and body are covered with sharp, lethal spikes. It blasts flame. Harry leaps for safety up a high rock. The tethered dragon flies to the end of its long chain. It lashes out angrily, giving Harry a vicious blow with its tail. He is flung onto the rocks below. The Hungarian Horntail flaps its huge leathery wings. Harry scrambles to his feet. He dodges another burst of flame. The crowd flinches. Karkaroff laughs. As the dragon flaps towards him, Harry climbs out of range. It lunges after him, baring its teeth. Taking shelter behind a huge rock, Harry sees his trusty broomstick zooming towards him. The dragon belches out another burst of flame. Harry leaves the rock, leaps away from the dragon, and jumps onto his Firebolt as it swoops down into the arena. Harry's friends cheer him on. The angry dragon stretches out its neck, breaking the chain. The creature flies free. Followed by the furious dragon, Harry zooms around the arena. He bursts out through the stands over the heads of the startled onlookers, wings tearing through the canopy, scattering professors. They scramble to their feet. Rita Skeeter straightens her spectacles. Pursued by the dragon, Harry flies over the valley towards the school. He narrowly avoids colliding with a tall stone tower. The dragon launches after him, as Harry swoops low over the Hogwarts. A faint mist is rising. As he flies, Harry checks over his shoulder. But the dragon is nowhere to be seen. As Harry rounds one of the towers, the dragon appears and knocks him off his broomstick. Harry falls onto a stiff roof and hurtles downwards. He stops his fall by grabbing desperately onto a narrow parapet. The dragon settles on a nearby turret. Harry dangles from the parapet, his gloved hands clutching a spiked pinnacle. He sees his broomstick far below. The dragon scrabbles across the turret onto the roof above Harry. The pinnacle snaps. Harry plunges down onto a windowsill. He hangs on desperately as the sill collapses under him. Dislodging tiles, the dragon claws its way across the roof towards him like a colossal bat.",
    "1154": "Harry scrambles up and reaches high above his head for a broomstick. The Firebolt is stuck fast. Harry frees the broomstick as the dragon lashes out, smashing the window to pieces. The dragon gets closer and closer. Harry falls from a great height, pursued by the Horntail. He reappears out of the mist once again astride his broomstick. A dragon's close behind. A burst of flame sets the end of Harry's broomstick on fire. It continues to smolder as the dragon zooms after Harry through a stone arch. Ahead is the massive viaduct. Harry flies towards it and hurtles through one of the narrow openings at the top. As the dragon tries to bat, its huge wings smash into the brickwork. Harry and the Horntail plunge into the valley far below. The crowd of spectators in the arena scan the sky with nervous anticipation. Dumbledore and Fudge look very concerned. Hagrid shields his eyes as he looks up into the empty sky. A tiny speck appears in the distance. Hermione screams. Harry hovers for a moment, then aims the Firebolt down towards the gleaming golden egg, and triumphantly snatches it up. In a packed Griffindor common room the painted characters in the pictures join in the applause. The twins hoist Harry onto their shoulders. The egg glows as Harry twists it open. They clap their hands over their ears. Ron appears in the doorway. Harry closes the egg. Ron faces Harry awkwardly. The twins usher everyone away. Hermione shakes her head, bemused. Gray clouds are reflected in the waters of the lake. Owls fly in and out of the great hall. Parvati and Padma Patil walk together down the length of the hall. They pass the table where Harry and his friends are eating breakfast. Harry sees Cho at the next table. As her friend points him out, Cho smiles. Embarrassed, Harry dribbles his drink. Hermione reads the paper. The small boy lingers at Ron's elbow. Hermione looks curious. He unpacks a strange brown garment and holds it up. White frills. The twins try it. Ron gets up reluctantly, his shirt hanging out. Filch starts the gramophone. The twins grin. The girls get up enthusiastically. But none of the boys moves. Then Neville stands up. Later, Harry and Ron find Neville waltzing by himself around the bedroom, wearing his pajamas and a pair of shiny dancing shoes. Ron and Harry approach Cho and her friends. The boys grin inanely, then move on hurriedly. He smiles at a group of Beauxbatons girls who stalk off. Hagrid and Madame Maxime. Madame Maxime reaches down to pick something from Hagrid's beard. She pops it in her mouth and licks her fingers seductively. Hermione, Harry, and Ron sit beside the lake.",
    "116": "Keyes puts the glass down noisily on Norton's desk. With the doorknob in his hand Keyes turns back to Norton with a glance down at his own shirt sleeves. They go out. The corridor door opens letting light in. Neff enters with his hat on and his briefcase under his arm. He switches the lights on, closes the door, puts the lights on, closes the door, puts the key in his pocket. He picks up the phone. Phyllis is on the phone. She is not dressed as in Norton's office. He hangs up, takes off his hat and drops hat and briefcase on the davenport. He looks around the room and crosses to lower the venetian blinds and draw the curtains. He gathers up the morning paper which is lying untidily on the floor and puts it in the waste-paper basket. The door bell rings. Neff stops in sudden alarm. For a second he stands there motionless, then crosses to the door and opens it. In the open door stands Keyes. Keyes walks past him into the room. His hands are clasped behind his back. There is a strange, absent-minded look in his eyes. Neff closes the door without taking his eyes off Keyes. Keyes stops in the middle of the room and turns. He prods his stomach with his thumb. He has stopped in front of Neff. They look at each other for a tense moment. Neff hardly breathes. Keyes shakes his head suddenly. Keyes prods his stomach again. Keyes resumes his pacing. Finally Keyes continues. He goes on pacing up and down. Finally Neff can't stand the silence any longer. He crosses to the corridor door. He puts his hand on the knob to open the door. The hallway is empty except for Phyllis who has been standing close to the door of Neff's apartment, listening. The door has just started to open. Phyllis moves away quickly and flattens herself against the wall behind the opening door. Keyes is coming out. Neff, behind him, looks anxiously down the hallway for Phyllis. Suddenly his eye catches a glimpse of her through the crack of the partly opened door. He pushes the door wide so as to hide her from Keyes. He pushes the call button and turns. He pulls back the elevator door and turns to Neff with one last glance of annoyance. She moves toward him but he does not respond. He pulls her close and kisses her. Two telephone operators and a receptionist are at work. Several visitors are waiting in chairs. Lola Dietrichson is one of them. She's wearing a simple black suit and hat, indicating mourning. Her fingers nervously pick at a handkerchief and her eyes are watching the elevator doors anxiously.",
    "1161": "Harry staggers in with Dudley. About to be sick, Dudley points weakly at Harry. An owl hits the ceiling and falls in a flurry of feathers. The owl flies off. The envelope speaks. Uncle Vernon smirks with glee. Under cover of darkness, the Dursleys smuggle Dudley into the car with a blanket over his head. Mrs. Figg watches from her window opposite. Mrs. Figg waves. In his bedroom, Harry thumps the wardrobe in anger and frustration. A photograph standing beside his owl's cage falls onto the carpet. Harry picks it up. He sits on his bed and looks at his parents dancing together in the moving photograph. Harry places it carefully on his bedside table beside a half-eaten plate of food. Cedric's face looms out of the darkness sweating with fear. Harry relives his terror as a flash of green light engulfs Cedric, who falls lifeless. Voldemort blank eyes stare out from his bony snake-like skull. Harry jerks awake. A streak of moonlight across his pillow. He lies as if in a trance. His lips moving. He turns his head as he hears a scraping sound. Still fully dressed, Harry reaches for his glasses and puts them on. He looks towards the door. The key is slowly turning in the lock. Harry grabs his wand and sits up. The key continues to turn. The key falls to the floor. With a dazzling flash, the door flies open. Lit by a wand, five people stand in the doorway. Harry recognizes one of them. Moody leads them all outside. Moody taps his stick. A broomstick flies into each person's hand. Mrs. Figg watches as they soar away high above Privet Drive. The twinkling lights of central London are spread out below. Kingsley, a wizard in African robes, flies in front. Following the line of the River Thames as it winds through the city. They fly low, cloaks flying, like a flight of huge bats skimming the surface of the shimmering water. They swoop by HMS Belfast and head upriver towards Westminster. Harry flies close besides Nymphadora Tonks. The pleasure boat on a nighttime cruise head straight toward them. Nymphadora steers to the right of it. Harry to the left. They pass the flood-lit houses of Parliament, reflected in the water like a huge ocean liner. A refuse lorry passes a garden in the middle of the London square. Moody leads them from the garden into the street. Facing a terrace of Georgian houses, he strikes the pavement. One of the houses in front of them moves to the left. Harry's jaw drops. As an extra house slides into the space and balconies slot into position. Oblivious, the people next door continue watching television.",
    "1166": "The student army faces a metal figure dressed as a cloaked Dementor holding a wand. A target is painted on its chest. Harry nods to Neville. Neville's wand is hurled across the room. The Dementor's wand falls. Filch lurks behind a pillar, spotting students approaching the room. He reaches the door as it dissolves back into the stone wall. Nigel is a plucky small boy. He faces Harry and prepares himself. Harry is thrown backwards. Eating a huge sandwich, Filch guards the blank wall. Ron faces Hermione. Neville encourages Ron. Ron flies backwards. Fred collects his winnings. Outside, Filch wakes from a doze. Nigel keeps watch as everyone leaves the room through another door. A student is ushered into Umbridge's room. Nigel floats in mid-air. Harry guides Cho's wand. She turns to look at him. Nigel plummets to the ground. He tucks in. The twins hide nearby. Red pustules break out all over Filch's face. Umbridge snaps her pencil. Umbridge's squad includes Draco Malfoy, Crabbe, Goyle and Filch. Luna skips along the corridor. The inquisitorial squad watch her go through the large wooden doors. The squad run. The door shrinks. They fall into a broom cupboard. Ginny Weasley's spell destroys the metal Dementor. It disintegrates into a pile of dust. She is amazed at her own skill. Her three brothers look rather put out. Harry beams. He watches Cho. She gives him a shy smile. Neville is determined to succeed. The wand spins out of a girl's hand. Harry congratulates him. Harry smiles proudly as his pupils applaud. The students start to leave. Ron and Hermione exchange a smile when they notice that Harry is watching Cho. She is lingering beside a mirror covered with photographs. Harry can't take his eyes off her. Ron and Hermione leave. Fred and George leave the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Cho in front of the mirror. They both look at a moving photograph of a smiling Cedric. She smiles at him. Cho looks up as something green and white appears above their heads. Harry gazes into her dark eyes. Their lips meet in a gentle kiss. They're standing close together, but only their lips touch. Above their heads, the bunch of mistletoe continues to grow. Ron looks blank. Harry catches Ron's eye. The three friends smile warmly. The black corridor. Harry writhes in his sleep. A snake reflected in the shining black. The blue door. The glass sphere. The light of a wand. A figure in a room full of shelves. It's Mr. Weasley, his eyes wide with alarm. Harry's neck flexes. Mr. Weasley falls. Mr. Weasley struggles. Harry's neck flexes again and again. Mr. Weasley lies still, covered in blood. Harry wakes.",
    "1167": "Professor McGonagall and Ron help Harry to Dumbledore's study. Ginny is there with the twins. Dumbledore turns from the moving portraits to face Harry. Professor Snape approaches behind Harry. Snape takes Harry down to his storeroom. Snape raises his wand. Harry's body goes rigid. He gasps in agony. His mind fills with terrifying memories. The wind sends a flurry of snowflakes in all directions. The snow begins to settle on the towers and turrets of Hogwarts School. The screen turns white. Children throw snowballs outside the London house. The kitchen is decorated for Christmas. Mr. Weasley is brought in, looking battered and bruised. He is in a wheelchair. He's wearing a paper hat. Standing in the doorway, Sirius raises his glass and winks. A knitted jerkin. Harry finds a room where the walls are covered with a tapestry, sewn with names and faces. The house elf startles him. He skulks off. Sirius's image has been burnt away. Sirius embraces Harry, and hugs him affectionately. Harry joins Hermione. Sirius looks back at the family tree and his own obliterated face. He closes the door. A gray sky is reflected in the river. Hogwarts School stands high on the cliffs above. Harry chats with Cho as they walk through the courtyard. Hermione finds them. Harry turns to Cho. He hurries off with Hermione. Harry, Ron and Hermione run down the hill towards Hagrid's cottage. A faint plume of smoke rises from the chimney. They hide as Umbridge comes out, wearing a fluffy purple coat over her pink dress. She sniffs and wrinkles her nose. She sprays herself with perfume, then sprays a cross on the cottage door. Hagrid's face is red and bruised. He holds a raw steak to his eye. The huge dog gobbles it eagerly. The wind blows wisps of straw across the room. Hagrid looks out of the window. A flash of lightning. A snake tattooed on a man's arm twists and writhes. A woman with wild hair runs her tongue over the snake tattooed on her arm. She hears an explosion. The woman, wearing striped prison clothes, escapes through a gaping hole. Dementors circle high above the prison, a colossal triangular tower, surrounded by an angry sea. Neville slowly closes the newspaper. At breakfast. A cozy fire burns in the Room of Requirement. Harry joins Neville. He is looking at a photograph stuck up on the mirror. The photograph that Sirius gave Harry at the station. Neville's parents are part of the group. Harry nods reassuringly. He looks at his own parents. A horse. Hermione's is an otter. Ron's is a dog. Luna produces a hare, which leaps joyfully over their heads. Harry grins proudly. The chandelier begins to shake.",
    "1169": "The owl takes wing, and swoops low along the misty road. As it glides silently away through the trees, an upright elderly gentleman appears out of the shadows. He has a flowing white beard and long, silky white hair, and wears a pointed black hat. A plump tabby cat sitting on a wall turns its head curiously. The old gentleman walks along the pavement and stops beneath a street light. In his hand, he holds a small metal object which he flicks open. He raises the metal object and points it at a street lamp. The light from the lamp flies towards his hand and the lamp goes out. The light from the second street lamp disappears, and then a third. When all the lights in the road have been extinguished, the old gentleman lowers the metal object and flicks it shut. He looks over the top of his half-moon glasses at the plump tabby cat. The cat gives a hiccup and its shadow looms large against the wall. It turns into a stern-looking woman wearing a cloak and a tall pointed black hat with a large brim. A bright light appears in the sky above the treetops, the lights of a motorcycle. Coattails flying, Hagrid, a huge giant, zooms down and screeches to a halt. Twinkling eyes peer out below dark bushy eyebrows. He has a huge black beard. He hands over a small bundle wrapped in a warm blanket. As Professor Dumbledore gently places the bundle on a doorstep, a tear runs down Hagrid's cheek. The tiny baby has a jacket scar in his forehead. A boy with a jacket scar in his forehead lies fast to sleep. In the cupboard under the stairs, Harry Potter wakes and puts on a pad of large round spectacles mended with sticky tape. A pudgy boy crushes down the stairs. A shadow of dust falls on Harry. The pudgy boy rushes into the kitchen. Harry comes in. Dudley stairs at the huge pile of birthday presents. Dudley and his mother get into the car with a big bag of sweets. Uncle Vernon wags his car key in Harry's face. In the Reptile House at the zoo, Dudley stares at the sleeping python. Vernon bangs on the glass. Harry looks at the snake sympathetically. The python lifts its head and winks. It flicks its tongue and nods. It shakes its head. Dudley knocks Harry aside. Suddenly, the glass partition disappears. Dudley tumbles over the rail. He falls head first into the pond inside the snake's enclosure. Dudley sits spluttering in the pond, as the snake slithers over the wooden rail and down onto the floor beside Harry. The python raises its head and stares straight at him.",
    "1170": "Harry lines up next to the keeper, Oliver Wood. Harry swallows nervously. The gate opens and the teams steps forward. One after the other, they fly out of the player's tunnel, and swoop around between the tall spectator towers, which surround the oval grassy arena. A student, introduces the game. In the stands, the Gryffindor supporters wear red and gold scarfs, Slytherin's colors are green and white. The Slytherin team fly out in their green cloaks. Standing around the oval arena, the spectators cheer on their teams. Other spectators are seated at the top of tall towers hung with heraldic designs. The players hover above the Quidditch trunk, which stands quivering in the center of the pitch. She kicks the trunk. The lid falls open and three boars fly out. Madam Hooch lifts out the red Quaffle and throws it high into the air. A Gryffindor chaser, Angelina, grabs the Quaffle and heads straight for the goal. The spectators duck as the players swoop low over their heads. The Slytherin players try to hit Angelina off. But she's too quick for them. She aims for the center hoop. And the Quaffle sails straight through the middle. The points go up on the score board. Harry is nearly knocked off his broomstick by a passing Bludger. Hagrid cheers on the Gryffindors. Snape stares, Quirrell looks nervous. The Slytherin captain gives Angelina a slight kick. Dodging a Bludger, he hurls the Quaffle towards a hoop, then scowls as Oliver skillfully knocks it away and gives him a cheeky smile. The Gryffindors capture the Quaffle. Ducking and diving, they pass it around the team from chaser to chaser. Well placed in front of the goal, Angelina catches the Quaffle and hurls it straight through the center of the hoop, past the helpless Slytherin keeper. Twenty points on the score board. The Gryffindor supporters are ecstatic. The Slytherin captain aims again for the goal. But Oliver catches the Quaffle. The captain smiles angrily. Snatching a bat from a beater, he deliberately hits a Bludger straight to Oliver, who falls backwards through the hoop. He hurdles downwards landing heavily on the dry sand below the goal. Harry stares with disbelief at the cheating Slytherin captain. Malfoy and his cronies celebrate while Professor McGonagall watches anxiously. A Slytherin sails over the beaters head and shoots accurately at the hoop. The quaffle flies through. Harry clenches his fists with frustration. Ten points to Slytherin. The Slytherin captain points at Angelina. Slytherin captain and his teammate, one on each side, jostling and confusing her. She collides with one of the tall spectator towers, tumbles down behind the canvas covering, and lies without moving on the gravel path below.",
    "1172": "In the courtyard, snow falls onto the tars and turrets of the school. Wearing a huge fur coat, Hagrid plots across the snow covered courtyard, dragging behind him an enormous Christmas tree. Inside the school, Hermione pulls a trunk on wheels past a group of ghostly Carol singers. She goes into the great hall, where tiny Professor Flitwick waves his wand and levitates decorations onto a tall Christmas tree. Hermione finds Ron and Harry playing chess at one of the long polished tables. She walks down the brightly decorated hall to join them. The white knight moves by itself. Ron contemplates the board. The red queen moves and knocks the knight's head off. Harry's snowy owl turns its head, as he leaps out of bed and puts on his spectacles. Down in the Gryffindor common room, Ron is standing in front of a blazing fire. Harry runs bare foot down the stone stairs towards a pile of presents on the Christmas tree. Harry picks up a parcel, while Ron dips into a box of every flavor beans. Harry opens a letter. He puts down the letter and unties the string on the parcel. He unfolds the silver wrapping paper, and takes out some soft material with a rich dark pattern. Harry swings it on to his shoulders. His head is floating. In the library, a floating hand carries a lantern between the bookshelves. Under the invisibility cloak, Harry peers about him wearily. Inside, he searches along more dark bookshelves. Harry takes off the cloak and holds the lantern closer to a shelf. Then he puts the light down. As he takes down a book and opens it, a screaming face burst violently out of the pages. Harry slams the book shut. Grabbing his cloak, Harry knocks over the lamp. He quickly puts on the invisibility cloak over his head and disappears. Filch, the caretaker, holds up a lantern. The lamp light shows up his thin lips. Hidden by the invisibility cloak, Harry feels his way across the dark room. He stops for a moment, as Filch passes by with his lantern. He breathes a sigh of relief, as the caretaker goes out through a far door way. Harry creeps into a moon lit corridor, where Filch's red- eyed cat is lurking. Harry is still invisible. As the cat runs past, two professors, Snape and Quirrell burst through a door. Suddenly suspicious, Snape turns around. Harry covers his mouth to muffle his breathing. Snape makes a grab, but only snatches a hand full of air. Harry takes a step backwards. Snape turned sharply back to Quirrell. A lamp. Quirrell, Snape and Filch rush away down the corridor. A door, in the far wall seems to open and close by itself.",
    "118": "Neff is in the booth dialing a number, and as she waits he looks around to make sure he is not watched. Neff hangs up. The LaSalle stops in front of the market. Phyllis steps out and goes into the market, looking around. Neff is moving slowly along the shelves, outwardly calm but with his nerves on edge. From beyond him Phyllis approaches. She stops beside him, facing the same way, with a couple of feet separating them. Phyllis moves close to him. Phyllis looks at him sharply, sideways. A customer comes along the aisle toward them. They move apart. The customer passes. Phyllis draws close again. Phyllis takes his arm, forgetting where she is. He pulls away. Phyllis takes off her dark glasses for the first time and looks at him with cold, hard eyes. Over Neff's face, as he looks after her, comes the COMMENTARY. Neff and Lola are climbing over a low hill in the foreground. The sky is starlit and music from the Bowl comes over the scene from below (Cesar Franck D Minor Symphony). As he helps her climb up, CAMERA PANS with them and shows the expanse of the Bowl below, a packed audience, and the orchestra on the lighted shell. They sit down on the grass. Neff sits near her, not too close. It is very dark and they are silhouetted against the shell lights. Neff puts a cigarette in his mouth and strikes a match. Neff glances at her. She is crying. A pause follows. She begins to cry again. Over Neff's face, as he listens to the music, comes the commentary. About 5:00 P.M. or a little later. A stream of office employees is coming out of an elevator; a second elevator reaches the lobby and some more office employees come out, among them Neff, wearing his hat and carrying his briefcase. CAMERA PRECEDES HIM as he walks toward the entrance doors. He is stopped by Keyes' voice, off to one side. Neff stops and looks towards the cigar counter, as he moves towards him. Keyes is standing there buying cigars. He is stuffing them into his pockets. He bites off the end of the cigar and puts the cigar into his mouth. He starts tapping his pockets for a match, as usual. Neff strikes a match for him. Keyes goes toward the street and OUT OF SCENE. Neff moves back into the lobby, CAMERA FOLLOWING HIM. As he reaches the elevator, he looks back over his shoulder, to make sure Keyes is gone, then steps into the empty elevator. Neff stops the machine. He sits down slowly, still holding the horn. He is deeply moved. Neff sits, staring blankly at the wall.",
    "1184": "Harry makes a grab but Malfoy spins out of reach. Malfoy flings the Remembrall away with all his might. The glass bowl flies over and over in the air. Harry steers his broom. Afterwards it soars a high stone tower. Upstairs in her study, Professor McGonagall sees Harry hackling towards her window. Just in time, he turns a neat somersault and catches the Remembrall, then tosses it victoriously into the air. Professor McGonagall steps to the window and looks down into the courtyard, as Harry rejoins the cheering first-years. Professor McGonagall walks towards them, purposefully. Malfoy and his cronies snigger. Still carrying his broomstick, Harry trails after Professor McGonagall. She stops outside a classroom. The twins. Hermione shows him a name on a Gryffindor Trophy. They go upstairs. The staircase swings into a different position on the opposite wall. Harry opens the door at the top of the stairs. They see a statue covered in cobwebs. A torch flares. The caretaker's scary red-eyed cat watches them run down a torch-lit corridor. Harry struggles with the latch. Taking out her wand. The door opens, and they rush through. Filch, the caretaker. He holds up a lantern and peers around suspiciously. In the middle of the room is a gigantic dog with three enormous heads and three sets of sharp, glistening teeth. The children rush for the door. One of the slobbering heads is so enormous, it completely fills the doorway. They slam the door shut. Daylight. Oliver and Harry carry a trunk out into the school grounds. They set the trunk on the grass, and Oliver takes out a large, red ball. Chained down, two brown balls struggle to escape. Oliver gives Harry a wooden bat, then unchains one of the brown balls. It shoots straight up, above their heads, almost out of sight. Harry swings the bat. He knocks the ball high into the air. It flies over the head of a statue on the battlements. The ball returns. Oliver catches it, but the brown ball knocks him to the ground. He struggles with it and with great difficulty, forces it back into the trunk and fastens it down with a strong chain. He gives Harry a tiny, golden ball. Delicate, golden wings spring out of the snitch. And it flutters above Harry's head. Ron flicks his wand. Hermione flicks her wand. A white feather rises from the desk and floats across the room towards tiny Professor Flitwick, who is standing on a pile of books. Seamus' face is smudged with soot. A smoldering feather sinks onto the desk. Crossing the courtyard. Hermione hurries past. The Great Hall is lit with flaming torches. Candles flicker and glow from the mouths of grinning pumpkins, which float above the heads of the students.",
    "1185": "The tables are spread with a banquet of mouthwatering food, cakes, sweets, pies, and shiny red apples. Harry looks at the empty chair beside him. Suddenly, Professor Quirrell bursts into the hall. Professor Dumbledore gets to his feet. Quirrell faints. As the students follow quickly into the Hall, Snape disappears through a side door. Harry and Ron run back down the long stone corridor towards the girls' bathroom. They hide as they see a monstrous shadow ahead of them. The troll is dragging a heavy club. Wiping her eyes, Hermione comes out of the toilet. She sees two green legs as thick as great tree trunks. Terrified, she stares up with horror at the troll's lumpy, green body blocking the doorway. Its horrible head, which looks like a squashed, green potato, is almost touching the high ceiling. Raising the club, the troll moves ominously towards her. Hermione locks herself in a toilet. The troll swings the club and smashes it along the row of cubicles. The flimsy partitions fall on top of Hermione. The boys burst into the bathroom. As more cubicles are smashed to smithereens, they throw broken pieces of wood at the troll. Ron hurls a length of metal pipe. Hermione hides under a row of wash basins. Terrified, she cowers against the pipes as the troll smashes a sink off the wall. Harry pulls out his wand. He grabs the swinging club and scrambles up onto the troll's back. He tries to shake him off. Harry hangs on with one hand. But before he can use his wand, he accidentally rams it up the troll's nostril. The angry troll holds Harry upside down, swinging him from side to side. Ron takes out his wand. The troll's club flies up into the air and hovers. Then, it falls and hits the troll hard on its ugly, green head. The troll drops Harry. He scuttles out of the way, as the troll reels dizzily around then crashes heavily to the ground. As the dust settles, Hermione creeps out from under the row of sinks. Water sprays out of a shattered pipe. She looks at the troll nervously. Harry pulls his wand out of the troll's nostril. He wipes it on his cloak. Ron smiles at Harry. Quirrell steps forward. He jumps as the troll gives a snot. At breakfast. Snape appears. Harry notices that Snape is limping. Harry's snowy owl flies into the great hall skimming over their heads. It drops a long thin parcel. Harry catches it. They unwrap the brown paper, to reveal a streamline broomstick with a highly polished handle. Stroking the white owl's feathers, Professor McGonagall smiles at Harry. Wearing leather gloves and Scarlett and gold cloaks, the Gryffindor Quidditch team assemble in the player's tunnel.",
    "1187": "Pettigrew grabs Lupin's wand. Pettigrew turns back into a rat and runs off, leaving only a pile of clothes. Hermione grabs Harry's arm to stop him from following. Lupin's fingers turn to claws. He bursts out of his clothes. His limbs grow thin and twisted. His face becomes a long snout with sharp teeth. He flings Sirius aside and stands whimpering. Hermione slowly approaches. The creature looks at her pathetically. It howls to the moon. Snape appears. The werewolf lashes out at him. The black dog leaps out of the shadows. It knocks the werewolf to the ground. The animals face each other growling, then both leap to the attack. They collide in mid air, then fall, snarling and biting. The dog runs off, chased by the werewolf. Harry follows and sees the werewolf hurling the dog against a rock. Harry throws a stone and hits the werewolf on the back of the head. It turns slowly and lopes menacingly towards him. It stops and lifts its head. It runs towards the sound of the howling. From where the dog fell, a figure gets up and limps away through the bushes. Harry follows the figure, hurrying through the trees towards the moonlit lake. He runs down the bank and across the stony shore to the edge of the water. Sirius is lying on his back, his eyes closed, a bloody claw mark on his shoulder. The water lapping the shore stops moving as a sheet of crackling ice spreads over the surface of the lake. Sirius opens his eyes and shudders with horror. Harry looks up. A swarm of hooded Dementors are circling above their heads, their black cloaks fluttering behind them. One swoops down and attacks Sirius. Harry pulls out his wand and points it at the Dementors. A silver mist forms a protective shield and the Dementors are held back. But the power of Harry's wand fades and the Dementors return to the attack. He cries out in horror as he falls back onto the stony beach beside Sirius. Again, the Dementors circle overhead, then swoop lower and lower, hovering over the two figures lying helpless below as life is gradually sucked out of them. A faint, silvery breath floats from Sirius' half-open mouth, illuminating his face. Exhausted, Harry lifts his head. To his surprise, the Dementors are floating harmlessly. He sees something shining on the far side of the frozen lake. Glowing amongst the trees, a magnificent silver stag with huge antlers stands facing him. Harry gazes at the beautiful animal. The dazzling light surrounding the stag grows even brighter. As the Dementors start to move again, they are turned back by a powerful invisible shield and swoop away over Harry's head.",
    "1188": "A tiny, silvery breath floats back into Sirius' mouth and his chest heaves. He gives a great sigh. The light draws back across the lake. Harry watches the bright light fade away, leaving only the faint image of a figure standing on the far shore. He falls back beside his godfather. They lie next to each other, sprawled unconscious on the stony beach. In the hospital wing, he pats Ron's bandaged leg. He walks to the door. Hermione is wearing a long chain necklace. She puts it around Harry's neck as well and spins its golden pendant. The room is filled with people moving backwards very fast. She replaces the necklace. The wheels of the great clock turn. They cross the quadrangle below and run along the cloister. She shows him the pendant. They hide. Harry and Hermione creep out from their hiding place. Harry looks around nervously as they run towards a huge stone. Standing behind it, they look down the hill. They watch themselves running along the path below towards Hagrid's cottage and the pumpkin patch. Harry and Hermione hurry down the path and hide behind the pile of pumpkins. Dumbledore, Fudge and the Executioner. She pulls him back out of sight. Hermione sees a pebble lying on the pumpkin in front of her. She throws the pebble through the window. She throws another. Harry rubs his head. Dumbledore knocks at the front door. As the three men go inside, the back door opens. Quickly, they run into the forest and observe themselves and Ron leave the cottage and hide behind the pumpkins. Pushing aside a branch, Hermione stares at herself in the past. The branch springs back. Hermione and Harry watch themselves and Ron run back up the hill, then they creep back into the garden. They peer towards the cottage. Crows peck at Harry's feet as he steals across the garden. Harry bows to Buckbeak, who lowers his head in return. Harry stretches towards the post where Buckbeak is chained. A crow pecks his hand as he undoes the chain. Buckbeak won't move. Harry hauls on the chain. Hermione throws the ferret. Buckbeak follows them into the forest. Fudge turns. The Executioner raises his axe and splits a pumpkin in frustration. Harry and Hermione use the dead ferrets to lure Buckbeak deeper and deeper into the safety of the forest. Leaving the hippogriff in a clearing, they run out of the trees until they see the Whomping Willow in the distance, flailing its branches. Lupin points his wand and the tree falls still. He goes down under the roots. Snape follows Lupin. They sit down beside each other on the grass. As darkness falls, a swarm of bats flutters through the forest.",
    "1191": "Harry jumps up onto the bed. The book scurries underneath in a flurry of torn paper. Harry lies down and peers under the bed. The book lies still, then snaps once more and slithers out, turning this way and that. It slides back under the bed. Harry quickly unties his shoelace and dangles his shoe over the edge of the bed. He drops his shoe onto the floor and the book hurtles out, snapping its covers. Harry jumps onto the book with both feet. In the corridor, a maid knocks at the room next door. Harry goes downstairs. A ginger cat chases a rat down the corridor. They pass a wanted poster for Sirius Black. The Hogwarts Express. Mrs. Weasley passes Ron his rat. A man is asleep in a compartment. Harry slides the door closed. Steam billows from the funnel as the Hogwarts Express travels through the rain beside the edge of a vast lake. Harry peers along the corridor. The door slides shut. The lights go out. Ron stares out of the window into the rain. The Express has stopped on a viaduct. One by one, the carriages go dark. The train lurches again. The air has turned so cold that they can see their breath. Ron pulls his hand away from the window as frost spreads across the glass. Ice forms in Professor Lupin's bottle of water. He is still asleep in the corner, wrapped in his cloak. The train lurches again. Hermione shivers. Something appears out in the corridor floating towards the door, something black, shapeless and mysterious. It reaches out. The door slides open and a horrible hand with long fingers like crooked, dead twigs reaches around it into the compartment. A hooded black shape looms in the doorway. Hermione's cat spits. Ron's rat, Scabbers, hides under his coat. The hideous cloaked figure floats into the compartment and faces Harry. He stares helplessly at the terrifying creature. It seems to draw the energy out of him. His body goes stiff. Professor Lupin throws off his cloak and points his wand at the threatening figure. In a flash of light, it hurtles backwards and disappears. Harry loses consciousness. Harry opens his eyes. He is lying on the seat. Hermione hands him his glasses and he puts them on. Looking confused, Harry takes the piece of chocolate from Professor Lupin. He gets up. He turns and smiles. Ron and Hermione stare at Harry. Harry looks at the rain teeming down outside the window. He stares at his own worried face reflected in the glass. Horseless carriages take the students up to Hogwarts Castle. They assemble in the Great Hall for the welcoming feast. Lighted candles hang above their heads as they sit at the long tables listening to the choir.",
    "1193": "Hagrid lifts Harry down. Malfoy struts forward. Buckbeak rears and attacks Malfoy. Hagrid lifts Malfoy up. As Hagrid carries Malfoy away, the hippogriff gently nudges Harry. He strokes its beak. Back at Hogwarts, a ghostly knight crashes through a window carrying a severed head. A headless horseman follows him through the Great Hall. Harry stares at the picture of Sirius Black in the newspaper. He sees a raging man with wild, staring eyes struggling violently with his prison guards. A foxglove grows in stony ground. A Dementor floats past. Frost appears on the petals and the flower immediately dies. A wardrobe. He whispers to Neville. The wardrobe door slowly opens and Professor Snape steps out. Snape is dressed as an old lady with a red handbag. Ron is pushed to the front. Ron steps forward, reluctantly. Snape becomes a huge, black spider. Ron's hair stands on end as it moves towards him, clicking its pincers. He reaches for his wand. It wears roller-skates. It sprawls across the floor. Parvarti faces a huge cobra. A jack in the box. Harry steps forward. Lupin watches him closely. A hideous Dementor. Lupin jumps in front of him. A full moon appears, half hidden by clouds. The moon becomes a balloon. It zooms around the classroom and back into the wardrobe. Ron and Hermione follow the other students, leaving Harry alone in the quadrangle. Harry talks to Professor Lupin. Harry grins, proudly. On the staircase. The other portraits are distraught. Weeping and wailing, the painted characters run from picture to picture. Dumbledore and Filch, the caretaker, stare at the empty painting. Dumbledore runs his finger across the slashed canvas as Filch looks around, suspiciously. In a picture of the African plains, the fat lady hides behind a hippopotamus. The heavy portcullis is lowered. The huge gates are closed and firmly secured by a system of strong iron locks, which swing neatly into place, one after the other. The Dementors keep guard outside the school as all of the students sleep in the Great Hall. Harry is wide-awake and listening. On the ceiling of the Great Hall, a star shoots across the celestial sky. A single autumn leaf flutters down from the Whomping Willow, then all the leaves fall at once and the tree shakes its bare branches. Snape enters the classroom and closes the shutters with his wand. He pulls down a screen. They open their books. Malfoy has his arm in a sling. He taps a projector and turns Ron's pages. Malfoy throws Harry an animated cartoon of Harry being hit on the head in a Quidditch match. An umbrella is whirled aloft by a gale force wind. Around the Quidditch pitch, sodden spectators stand in the driving rain, cheering their teams.",
    "1196": "Harry sees something swirling around inside the crystal ball. He moves closer and peers into the mist. He sees the face of Sirius Black. A hand claps him on the shoulder. Bemused, Professor Trelawney gazes at Harry. A worried look on his face, he runs out of the room and hurries away down the circular staircase. Outside, in a ruined part of the castle, crows alight on the fallen masonry. Hermione, Harry and Ron peer through a ruined archway. A man wearing a black hood is sharpening the curved blade of a huge axe. They leave the school, walk through the cloister and into the grounds. Malfoy and his cronies are on the slope above Hagrid's cottage. Furious, Hermione threatens Malfoy, her wand at his throat. He's terrified. As she turns away, Malfoy smirks. She turns back and punches him full in the face. Malfoy and his cronies make a run for it. She smiles at Ron. Ron, Harry and Hermione run down the steep steps cut into the grassy slope towards Hagrid's cottage. They find him gazing sadly out of the window at Buckbeak, who is chained to a post in the pumpkin patch. A line of dead ferrets is hanging nearby. He feeds a small creature. He opens a small blue tin and takes out Ron's rat. Another pebble hits Harry. They look out of the window and see Fudge, Dumbledore and the Executioner making their way towards the cottage. He ushers them out. They peer out of the back door. At the front door, Hagrid welcomes his guests. Harry, Ron and Hermione escape from the cottage and run down the garden path. They hide behind a huge pile of giant orange pumpkins. A crow lands beside them as they anxiously watch the cottage. Hermione spins round and peers into the forest. They run as fast as they can away from the cottage and up the grassy slope. Buckbeak watches them go. Harry glances back at the hippogriff still chained to a post in the pumpkin patch, then he follows his friends. Halfway up the hill, they stop and look back towards the cottage. Smoke rises from the stone chimney. Dumbledore, Fudge and Hagrid come out of the cottage with the Executioner. He walks across the garden, carrying his sharp axe over his shoulder. He moves through the pumpkin patch towards Buckbeak. They watch horrified as the Executioner raises his axe. The huge blade swings down. Hermione hides her face on Ron's shoulder, putting her arms around his neck. Suddenly, Ron drops his rat, blood on his finger. Ron chases the rat. Harry and Hermione follow Ron. Ron catches Scabbers and slumps down near the Whomping Willow with its twisted trunk.",
    "1197": "Ron points, his hand shaking. The huge, black dog leaps over their heads, grabs Ron's leg and drags him towards the tree. Still holding Scabbers, Ron is dragged under the roots. Harry makes a grab for him. A branch knocks Harry and Hermione over. The Whomping Willow waves its branches menacingly. Cautiously, they move towards it. The tree attacks them. A branch lashes down. Harry loses his glasses. Hermione jumps over a swinging branch, but the next one lifts her off the ground. Harry rolls over as the tree lashes out. He sprints off into flailing branches as Hermione is whirled above his head. Scratched by the sharp twigs, Hermione is twisted this way and that as she clings to the branch. She is turned upside down. Harry finds his glasses and puts them on to see Hermione flying towards him. Desperately, she grabs hold of his T-shirt. He is hauled into the air. They hurtle around until Hermione lets go and Harry falls down the hole under the tree roots. Hermione lands on top of him. Ahead of them is a flight of steps cut into the twisted roots. They start to climb. Harry and Hermione climb up through a trapdoor under bare floorboards. A faint light filters through wooden shutters. They go up a rickety staircase and along a dingy landing. In a dilapidated room. Huge paw prints on the dusty floor lead across the room to a wild-eyed man with matted hair and a ragged convict's uniform. Hermione stands in front of Harry. Pushing Hermione aside, Harry knocks the man down and threatens him with his wand. Harry's wand flies out of his hand. Professor Lupin helps Sirius to his feet. The children stare, horrified, as Sirius embraces him. Lupin narrows his eyes. Lupin looks from Sirius to Harry. Then gives Sirius his wand. Snape enters. Harry slides Hermione's wand from her pocket. Snape flies backwards. Sirius grabs the rat. It runs across the piano. It scurries towards a rat hole. Lupin and Sirius wave their wands. They drag out a pudgy little man with sharp, pointed teeth. He rubs his beady little eyes. One finger on his left hand is missing. He tries to run. They stop him. Pettigrew grabs Harry. He is pulled away. Pettigrew sinks to his knees. Harry and Sirius help Ron out from the hole under the tree. Hermione sits beside him. Sirius gazes towards the distant lights of Hogwarts. Harry watches Sirius anxiously. Lupin appears with Pettigrew. Lupin pulls him away. Hermione points to the sky. A full moon appears from behind the clouds. They all stare at Professor Lupin. As the moonlight touches his face, his eyes turn green and his face distorts.",
    "1204": "Marley's lying next to Connor. Marley watches him leave and settles back down next to the sleeping lad. He leaves the editor's glass-fronted office. The children are playing ball in the garden with Jenny when John arrives home. The kids, Jenny and Marley tackle him to the ground. John, the boys and Marley head back to the house. Marley's having difficulty getting up the steps. Marley's asleep in the dining room. The windy dog gets up and trots out. John puts on a coat and goes back outside. They use torches to search the rainy night. Jenny switches the light on in the barn. The children are gathered together at a window. She picks up Colleen with a reassuring smile. Patrick glumly follows his mother as John continues to search outside. He walks down the drive towards the post box by the roadside. He flashes the torch around and spots Marley lying by a tree. The dog whines as John touches his belly. A white-coated vet washes her hands. Close to tears, John leaves the surgery. He steps out onto the street, shrugging on his jacket and walks, shoulders slumped, towards the car. He puts the key in the door and puts his hands on his hips and sighs. Later, he arrives home. She looks at the scrapbook and grins. Resting his cheek on his right hand, John doesn't look at her and examines his other hand, distractedly. Jenny puts an arm around him. He stares at the scrapbook of pasted-in columns. Morning sun shines on the big stone house. John's asleep, slumped over the scrapbook. He turns to Jenny and smiles. She slumps against a door frame in relief. Marley bounds across the large lawn and sits down by the road. As the school bus approaches, Marley trots up to the bus as Patrick and Connor get off. Marley joins in the race. John and Billy walk through town past the tall clock tower of City Hall. Sebastian and John grin broadly at one another. John looks back as they part. Sebastian approaches two women. John drops his bag on a chair by the front door near to a baby grand piano. There's a note on the dining room table. Marley's knocked over the dustbin in the kitchen and is having a feast. He picks up the bin and they go for a walk through a sunny meadow bordered by trees with golden autumnal leaves. Marley trots along beside John, who has his hands thrust in his pockets. They sit down together on the path. John strokes Marley and studies his old friend. The dog turns and looks at him. They sit, side by side, in the golden evening sun, looking out over the lush valley.",
    "1205": "Lights burn in the house at night. He's lying by the fire. He lies down next to Marley. Jenny fetches a blanket for the pair. Marley's lying under a tree. He gets out of the car and runs indoors. Connor gives him a hug. Jenny fights back tears. John takes the stuffed lamb and Patrick tearfully hugs Marley. The boy looks imploringly at his parents. Jenny frowns in sympathy at her son's pain, and John tries a reassuring smile. He carries Marley out to the car and gently lays the old dog down in the boot. John goes to get behind the wheel as Jenny tearfully strokes her dying pet. She closes the door and presses her hand to the glass as John drives away down the winding drive through trees adorned with golden brown autumn leaves. At the surgery, John sits and waits with his hands clasped together. At home, Patrick's leafing through John's old columns. Jenny walks in and ruffles his blonde hair. Jenny controls her own emotions as John gives into tears. He goes back into the surgery where Marley is lying on the table. He runs his hand down Marley's beige coat. He strokes the dog's tail, which isn't wagging now. He holds a rear paw and rubs Marley's shoulder, then leans forward and hugs his friend, burying his face in Marley's neck. He gently strokes Marley's head. Jenny waits tearfully at home. The vet puts a hypodermic into the IV line going into Marley's leg. Patrick slots a videotape into a player. Jenny waves to the camera holding baby Patrick in a cowboy outfit. Marley stands expectantly next to the high chair. Jenny slips him a tidbit. Patrick stares at the TV. At the surgery, the vet pushes down the plunger on the needle. John watches Marley and Jenny sits sadly, staring into space. On the video, John takes off Patrick's nappy, which Marley then grabs. Patrick grins, watching as his father tries to wrestle the nappy off the dog. Jenny sits sadly in the window seat. Patrick concentrates on the old video footage of his mother laughing and a close up of Marley, staring puzzled into the camera. The vet puts a stethoscope to Marley's chest and listens. John continues to stroke Marley's head as the vet takes off the stethoscope and turns away. The Grogans walk across their leaf-strewn lawn, John carrying Colleen on his shoulders. He lifts down the little girl as they reach a small grave by a tree. She puts the picture in the grave. He puts his paper in with Colleen's. She takes off her necklace and kneels down next to the grave. She drops the necklace in with Marley.",
    "1208": "Climbing the wooden ladder leading to it, he cuts the rope securing a door and pulls it open. Michael is nearest the door. Rambo removes the blindfold. Rambo leaves, passing the footless corpse of the crucified man. At the dance show, one of the soldiers pulls on a cigarette, stands and throws the butt at the dancing girls. A woman raises an arm to protect herself. The soldier raises his arms in triumph. Another soldier throws liquid at them. The women cower. Diaz creeps between two huts and is surprised by Rambo, who's waiting there. Rambo beckons to him. At the dance, a soldier with a can of booze climbs onto the stage with a grin on his face. He slaps one of the girls on the rump. She lurches forward. The soldiers jump and wave their arms ecstatically. Lewis runs past a hut with his weapon primed. Two guards in ponchos walk over the wooden bridge. Rambo takes cover in the timbers beneath it. The soldier on stage continues to humiliate a terrified dancing woman by pouring his can of drink over her head. Rambo wades up the stream. A soldier emerges from a hut onto a veranda. He angles a lamp above his head to illuminate them. He carries a spirit-type bottle of golden-brown booze in his hand. He swigs from the bottle and goes inside. He emerges once more. He plants his hands on his head and heads away across the sodden compound. BN sneaks up to the cage, breaks open a chain on the door and motions the women to follow him quietly. Rambo continues upstream. It rises to meet the ground of the camp and is bordered by bushes. Yards from its end, Rambo spots a Burmese soldier pushing a young boy in front of him. Rambo ducks out of sight as they go by. The dance event descends into chaos. The soldier on stage slams one of the women to the stage floor. He picks her up and throws her over the arms of his fellows below. They begin to tear at her clothes. One trooper fights the others off and leads the girl away, keeping his comrades at arms' length. The boy is pushed into another hut, where the commander is sitting. The door of the hut remains open. The commander walks up to the boy and inspects him. The commander wears a tunic decorated with ribbons. It is open and he wears a white vest and dog tags underneath. The commander strokes the boy's head. Rambo looks away in disgust. The door closes. Rambo emerges from hiding. He checks his watch, three minutes to two. Diaz hops over a timber fence and runs up the ladders to the volunteers cage.",
    "1211": "They head into the forest. BN now leads the escapees as they mount a rise. Lewis treads on a hidden land mine. Diaz clamps a hand over his mouth. More troops dismount from the back of the lorry. The lorry moves on. Louis is wide-eyed in shock. Diaz whispers to him. Reese looks about. Michael cuts at the bloody wound. Louis bites on a cloth. Soldiers get off a lorry with the tracker dogs. The dogs are after the scent and they lead their handlers in a rapid pursuit, followed by a large body of their colleagues. Rambo, Sarah and School Boy run up a rocky slope. She stumbles in the dirt. Rambo runs back to her and helps her up. School Boy moves up front. Michael and the mercenaries carry Lewis on a hastily-constructed stretcher. The dogs lead their handlers. On the rocky path, School Boy stops to listen in a craggy crevice. Rambo starts to tear a strip from Sarah's shirt. He ties the strip around his boot. School Boy tosses Rambo an explosive. Lewis' party look around in horror. The commander's truck stops. Via a walkie-talkie, the commander screams orders at an armed patrol boat on the river. The grey patrol boat flies the Burmese flag. The captain signals to his helmsman, who fires up the engine. A handler offers a tracker dog a sniff of clothing. Rambo runs through the undergrowth with a strip of Sarah's clothing on his boot. The troops seem to be gaining on him. Rambo runs through a carpet of dry brown leaves. A lorry pulls into a clearing and more troops dismount. Rambo heads through the forest at full tilt. Rambo skids to a halt beside a gnarled tree. He takes the claymore explosive and launches it in the limbs of the roots. He glances in the direction of his pursuers. He rips the clothing strip from his boot. He pulls a round metal disc, which is fastened to the body of the mine by a piece of twine which he ties around the cloth. Another glance in the direction of the dogs. He pulls a priming pin from the bomb and covers the explosive with leaves. He takes off into the forest. The dogs and their handlers halt by the bush. A small dog with beady eyes, tan fur and a white beard sniffs around leaves and ferns. The handlers look at each other. One of the soldiers looks along the tree. The rusty grey shape of the Tall Boy Missile is lodged in the ground and leaning against the branch. Wide-eyed and terrified, the handlers quickly pull the excited dogs away. A soldier kneels to inspect the ground.",
    "1215": "The men in the boat wear burnt orange robes and have shaved heads. The boat's motor churns up plumes of white foam on the river. Rambo is at the tiller, steering. The boat enters more populated territories. There are wooden homes on the riverside and harbors made of timber. A building on the riverside features a sign, comprising a large painting of a cobra, on the wall. There is also a Red Cross sign. The boat pulls in at a harbor on which there are two men. They stop what they're doing and turn their attention to the boat. One man wears a white t-shirt and a black hat. The other, a blue shirt and a bandanna. The boat slows to a halt. Rambo and his men disembark from the boat. Rambo's face is doleful and weary. The sun casts an orange glow on the river water. Surrounded by onlookers, a young snake-charmer crouches alone in an open area facing two cobras. One of the cobras rears and strikes at the dark-haired wrangler. A snake merchant approaches Rambo. To Rambo's men. The seller gives Rambo cash. Rambo walks away in disgust and heads for the perimeter of the arena. He empties the bag containing the cobra into a wooden crate. A group of Westerners arrive, led by Michael, who has thinning hair, and a blonde girl, Sarah. Michael greets and talks to the merchant, who points to Rambo. Rambo maneuvers a cobra into the crate and slams down the lid. In the arena, the wrangler teases a cobra. Rambo stands near wire and wood snake cages as Michael and his party approach. Rambo throws a rat into one of the cages. Rambo scratches his face idly. Michael seems temporarily lost for words. Rambo leaves. Michael turns to his party. Sarah is mid 20s, pretty with blonde, scraggly hair and a high forehead. She follows Rambo out. He's washing his face and hair in a water barrel. Rambo picks up a towel and wipes his face. He hangs the towel on a hook. He walks up to her and fixes her with a firm stare. Rambo walks away from her. He toils alone in a darkened workshop. The only light comes from sunlight outside and the flames of the fire. He uses a hammer to forge a piece of broken steel on an anvil. The end of it is orange and white with heat. He wipes an arm across his sweaty brow. His blows on the steel become more intense. In darkness, save for the glow of headlights on jeeps and beams from hand torches, the army drag people from their homes and march them away at gunpoint, under the supervision of the cigarette-smoking commander.",
    "1216": "The villagers have their hands behind their heads. They find armed men. The soldiers open fire on them. Women cry and hide their eyes. Soldiers break into homes and drag out youths. The officer watches coolly. A soldier shoots a man dead. The commander addresses the village. Terrified women cover their mouths. In Rambo's fort, sparks fly as he grinds round blades on a spinning wheel. Veins stand out on his muscular arms. He stops grinding, drops the blade and runs a hand through his hair. A rusty metal fan on a rod lies on a bench nearby. He removes a nut from the rod and discards the fan. He replaces it with his creation, a new fan. He adds a nut to the thread at the end of the rod and reaches onto a bench. He picks up a spanner and tightens the nut. He deftly lifts the assembly off the bench and puts it down. He leaves the workshop and walks out into the night air, where it's raining heavily. His boat is moored below at the water's edge. He looks down at it. A solitary figure sits on the boat. Rambo wipes rain away from his face. He walks down a wooden walkway to the boat. Sarah is sitting under the boat's canopy. She stands. She's soaking wet. He stares blankly at her. Sarah looks disappointed. She emerges from the canopy of the boat and walks past him, climbing onto the harbor. She begins to walk the length of the harbor towards the walkway. She pauses and brushes rain from her head. Rambo steps onto the harbor. She turns and stares at him before walking back towards him with an imploring look. She brushes rain from her hair once more. Rambo stares at her. His face betrays no emotion. She turns away from him with a faint smile and walks back along the harbor. She wears a sodden gray hoodie and jeans. She climbs the wooden walkway. Rambo rubs his chin and runs a hair through his hair, then walks along the harbor. In the morning light, on Rambo's boat as it motors along the river, Michael addresses his party. Rambo is at the tiller. Michael glances at Rambo, who affords him the merest flicker in return. Rambo stoically leans on the tiller with both hands. Sarah approaches him. She smiles and turns away from him. Dusk. The boat motors around a headland. A small white glimmer appears on the river and a cone-shaped reflection in the water. It's thrown by the boat, which has headlamps mounted on its canopy. Michael and his volunteers doze in the boat. Sarah is nestled against Michael's chest. Rambo's attention is caught.",
    "1219": "Volunteer James gives a sermon under a canopy with the aid of a translator. The man with the camcorder records the event. Another volunteer gives medical care. Sarah passes by him and walks up wooden steps into a hut. Young people sit in a waiting area, some with missing limbs. Sarah finds Michael with another patient who lies on the floor of the hut. Sarah hands Michael a roll of bandage. He binds a stump where his shin should be. Michael's patient writhes in pain. Michael gives him a comforting pat. Sarah looks down at them, then at the waiting patients. A very small boy has only one leg. The village is attacked with rocket fire. A rocket is primed. Sarah hands a child to its mother. The rockets are fired by the army. A man is blown to pieces. Michael roams with a child in his arms. Rockets hit the paddy field. A wooden hut is destroyed. Sarah cowers under a hut. The army enter the village with weapons blazing. A volunteer carrying a child in each arm is cut down. The children are dragged from him. One is shot and the other bayoneted in the stomach while his face is held down by an army boot. A woman is shot, another abused and a third dragged away by her hair. In slow motion, a volunteer in a baseball cap tries to outrun the rocket fire. A hit hurls in through the air, severing his legs below the knee. A man kneels before a pair of soldiers with weapons. Soldiers hack off villagers' limbs. A soldier with a flamethrower sends a plume of flame into a building. Villagers with clothing on fire run from it and roll in the dust. A small child is torn from its mother and tossed into the burning building. Sarah runs. Michael is rifled-butted. The villagers run across the paddy field. The truck with a machine gun on a tripod arrives. The villagers are massacred in mid-flight. Sarah is accompanied by a mother and a child who run with her. The mother is shot in the back and drops to the ground. From the truck, the cool commander watches the carnage while his subordinate blazes away. Partially caught by a blast, Sarah tumbles into the water of the field. The commander pulls on his cigarette. More villagers run towards the truck. Their bodies are torn apart by bullets. Gunfire picks off survivors. Sarah looks up just as two of the soldiers grab her by the arms. She tries to fight them off but they haul her to her feet. They drag her away by the scruff of her neck. In the truck, the soldier in charge of the machine gun pivots to and fro in search of victims.",
    "1220": "Corpses litter the remains of the village. Huts and trees are on fire. The commander watches, his eyes hidden behind his sunglasses. Green forests. A misty mountain towers over a lake. Rambo's boat sits serenely at its home harbor. Rambo sits on the deck with his elbows resting on his knees, toying with the crucifix Sarah gave him in his sinewy hands. He looks up thoughtfully, then stands. Sheets of lighting bombard dark mountaintops. A montage of flashback images of Rambo in combat. Rambo lies in a hammock. He climbs out. In the rain-soaked darkness, a figurine silhouette holds an umbrella and stands in the half-light. The figure lowers the brolly and walks towards him. Rambo switches on a light. Marshall is a middle-aged man with neat gray hair. He wears a dark overcoat over a collarless pale blue shirt. Rambo start thinking about something and then walks towards him. Rambo beats a piece of hot steel. He shoves the metal into burning coals. He douses the white hot metal in a water. The cooling metal is the shape of a machete. A rainy morning. The singer is Reese, one of a motley collection of mercenaries in Rambo's boat, including bearded Diaz and En-Joo, handsome stubbly School Boy and bald Lewis. Rambo sits at the tiller, watching them. Lewis stands at the prow of the boat, looking out at the river. Rambo stares at Lewis blankly. Lewis stares at Rambo again. Rambo looks vacantly ahead. With an angry glare at Rambo, Lewis returns to the prow of the boat and continues his belligerent surveillance. Rambo gazes out across the water surface. A flock of birds takes off en masse. A watchtower at a military camp surrounded by razor wire. Troops eat in a large mess tent. One idly throws leftovers over his shoulder into a cage of female prisoners outside. Three soldiers troop out of the mess hut. The Burmese flag is raised on a pole. Beneath it are two ranks of downcast male prisoners, now army draftees. A drill instructor thumps one in the stomach. The camp huts are timber with above-ground supports as foundations. Sarah lies bound beneath one. The foundation is divided into two sections. In the section next to Sarah, two fat pigs fight over food. Through the slat, she watches a soldier walk away from the hut. The commander and the subordinate have an overview of a larger compound, in which the pigs roam freely. Opposite the soldier's vantage point and above the piggery is a cage in which the downcast male survivors of Michael's party kneel. Their hands are tied behind them. Their faces are muddy. One lifts his head and catches the commander's eye.",
    "1221": "The volunteer looks down. On Rambo's boat, Lewis stands in the stern with his back to Rambo. He points to himself. He looks at Rambo, who ignores him. Rambo fixes him a glare but remains expressionless. Rambo turns away and spits into the river before staring ahead again. Lewis walks away in disgust. Handsome and rugged School Boy glances up the boat at Rambo. The military camp at night, a truck sits at the end of two rows of huts. In the pigsty cell, Sarah looks up through the floorboards into the hut. The commander appears. He has a short, neat mustache. He takes a pull on one of his ever-present cigarettes and blows smoke. He smirks and walks away. Sarah rests her head against the wall of her prison. On the river, the boat rounds a promontory. Its headlamps are off. Lewis leans pensively on the boat's prow. He turns to look at the stern. Rambo stares back at him. Lewis turns away. The boat pulls alongside the harbor where Michael's party were dropped. The mercenaries disembark laden with various weapons and bandoleers, including automatic rifles with telescopic sights. Two rebels approach along the path leading to the gangplank. Rambo walks up the gangplank. The party of mercenaries, BN the rebel and the boy tracker set off into the forest. Rambo solemnly watches them go. He turns away and walks back to the boat. BN and the boy lead the mercenaries through forest undergrowth. School Boy's rifle is particularly bulky. They cross a small stream. En-Joo wears a khaki hat. Diaz has a shirt covering his hair. Resting against a tree and partially covered in vines is a dull gray object, bullet shaped but with fins at one end. Lewis regards it warily. The rest of the mercenaries pay the bomb little attention. They move on. They pass a cave mouth on a craggy mountainside. Inside, there's a small collection of nervous-looking locals, comprising women, children and old men. The mercenaries move on. En-Joo, Reese and Diaz each give the locals a backward glance. The village paddy field, the water is clear but there is a pale brown mud beneath it. Sticks of plant poke into the air. Trees are reflected in the water's surface. A decomposing human corpse lies partially submerged in the water. A dead buffalo lies beyond it. BN and the mercenaries overlook the field. More corpses lie at the edge of the field. Reese holds his shirt against his nose. A woman's severed head hangs from a post. Lewis turns to look. There are two bodies hanging from bare rafters in the remains of a hut. The boy nods and leaves. The mercenaries make a wary record of the ruined village.",

A surgeon lifts Tim's heart out of his body and carefully passes it to a colleague. Dr. Briar and her colleagues are operating on Emily. A medic opens the door of the operating room to let in another medic who is carrying Tim's heart, which is in a stainless steel bowl. Emily, anesthetized and wearing a theater cap, lies on the operating table. A golden, dream like image of Emily and Tim sitting in the shade of the tree and entwining their fingers. Emily's new heart lies still in the open cavity of her chest. Dr. Briar looks up at the monitor, which is flat-lining. The heart begins to beat. Emily lies peacefully on the operating table, eyes closed. The real Ben sits miserably in Tim's motel room, staring at a wall of newspaper cuttings about the crash. There are also photos of the people Tim helped and an article on Ezra. Ben sifts through envelopes, each of which has the name of a person Tim wanted to help, including Ben's. Ben hands Emily a list of the people written on the back of a photo of Sarah. Ben hands Emily a photo. The photo shows Tim standing at Holly's hospital bedside. In her garden, Emily weeps as she reads Tim's letter to her. Glum and pensive, Emily lies in a bathtub. Emily's head and shoulders are framed by the water in the tub. Emily slowly submerges herself so that her ears are beneath the water. Emily lies with her eyes closed, listening. Wearing a delicate summer dress, Emily walks in a sunny park. She approaches a children's choir singing in the open to an audience of adults who clap along. Ezra is playing the piano. Emily watches and looks moved. When the songs ended, Ezra points the audience's standing applause towards the choir. Ezra rises and bows, then gestures to the choir again. Emily watches intensely through wide, gentle eyes. She cranes her neck to keep track of Ezra as he leaves the stage and moves effortlessly towards members of the audience. Emily walks over to Ezra as he chats to some of the children in passing. He turns to her confidently. He's no longer blind. Emily shakes her head. Her eyes begin to fill with tears and glisten. Emily nods and blinks back tears. Light dawns in Ezra's eyes. He smiles gently. Emily smiles through her tears, which roll down her cheeks. Ezra gazes at her incredulously. He shakes her hand. Another big tear rolls down Emily's cheek.",

Ben gets out of the car, and locks it with a remote. Dressed in a smart suit and tie, Ben goes to the fence but stops short and stares at the dog. A neighbor who is gardening spots him. Ben parks on an upper story of a car park, which looks onto St. Matthew Medical Center. Ben enters the center and goes to a blonde middle-aged woman on the reception desk. Ben's in a lift. He stands aside as two doctors wearing stethoscopes get in with him. Ben holds back the door. Emily gets in. They all face the front. Then Ben turns and studies Emily for a long moment. His expression concerned. Emily, who is slender and wearing a nightdress, gets out of the lift and walks listlessly down a hospital corridor. Ben waits and stops the lift door closing with the briefcase he's carrying. He gets out of the lift and follows Emily at a discreet distance. He stops at double doors and looks through the glass panes in them. He sees Emily, who is wearing UGG boots with her nighty, shuffle down onto a ward. Ben follows her. Emily's image blurs. She passes a reception desk, then rounds a corner and disappears. Ben approaches the desk. Ben smiles and gives the stout nurse a brief wave as he heads away. His smile fades as he walks. A clip attached to Emily's forefinger attaches her to an electrocardiograph machine. 30-something Emily lies asleep in her hospital bed in shadowy light. Ben stands in the doorway watching her intently. His expression sad. As she stirs, Ben makes a swift but calm exit. Emily glimpses him. She sits up and stares after him. Emily frowns and looks puzzled. Ben's car is parked in the dark, wet night. He sits at the wheel, deep in solemn thought as the wipers sweep back and forth. Ben addresses colleagues in a small conference room at Apogee Aeronautics. He points to a rocket model. Ben checks a message on his BlackBerry. Ben drives a Corvette sports car. He enters the beach house and puts down his things. She's on the patio, looking out to sea. Ben lies lethargically on his couch, staring at his mobile phone on the coffee table. He picks the mobile up. Ben snaps his mobile shut and throws it down. Ben drives his saloon along the sunny coast road from the beach house. He pulls up in a parking spot outside a large institutional-looking building with the stars and stripes hanging over the door.",
    "1235": "Ezra sits playing the piano in the foyer of a modern glass and steel mall. People of all different ages mill in the area, going about their business. Ben stands in a shop doorway, watching Ezra play. Ben looks deeply moved and appears to drift off into his own thoughts. A couple cuddle and giggle in a diner. Ezra, who's in his 40s, sits at a table nearby, sipping from a mug. A pretty, blonde waitress speaks to him. Ben sits, watching nearby. Susan walks off. Ben watches sympathetically, then gets up. He throws money down onto his table. Then, saunters up to Ezra's table. Ezra, an attractive man with an aquiline nose and longish brown hair, sips his drink then self-consciously smooths down his hair, unaware of Ben standing over him. Ben looks down at the pie on a plate in front of Ezra. Ezra's blue eyes are clouded. A look of surprise crosses Ezra's face as Ben goes. A single box jellyfish floats in Ben's aquarium in the motel. Ben sits watching it. Ben sits motionless in the shadowy room, then goes to pick up his mobile. He checks the display and slowly opens up the mobile. Emily, in hospital. Lying in bed with air tubes running from her nose, Emily fiddles with his card. She holds her mobile away from her and looks at it briefly. He walks down a corridor. He leaves his motel. She snuggles down in the bed. Ben walks in the night. Emily's smile fades. She closes her eyes and smiles. Her eyes are open again. Emily blinks and begins to look drowsy. Phone to his ear, Ben walks towards the main door of the St. Matthew Center. The glass doors slide apart and he enters. Ben walks down a hospital corridor towards Emily's room. He stops outside her room and looks at her through the window. Emily lies fast asleep, surrounded by machines and monitors. Ben closes his clamshell mobile phone. Emily lies on her side. Her ear pressed against her phone, which lies on a pillow beneath her. Ben slowly and gently pulls the phone out and shuts it. Ben stands, looking down at her tenderly. Ben puts Emily's phone on the bed, draws up a chair and sits at her bedside. Ben stares down at her peaceful, but bruised face. Emily continues sleeping peacefully. Emily asleep on her side, wakes, blinks drowsily and rubs her eyes as she slowly comes to. She sits up a little, freezes, then sits up fully. Emily stares down at Ben, who is slumped back in the chair beside her bed, fast asleep. Removing the oxygen tubes from her nose, Emily watches Ben, then slowly reaches out, and caresses the back of one of his hands with her fingertips.",
    "1242": "On a dark, rain-sodden pitch, Bremner, in a yellow Leeds shirt, slides down a Derby player. Leeds players foul and head-butt their counterparts. Brian bellows at Don. Bremner strolls up to Brian and shakes his hand on the touchline. Bremner smirks. Brian and Peter are dazed in the rain as the Leeds players trudge off, gesticulating at the Derby crowd. Longson stalks angrily down the corridor, past the away dressing room, to stand beside a hangdog Brian surveying his battered team. Longson glares at Brian, then turns on his heel, leaving a rueful Brian to meet Peter's concerned look. Brian addresses the press assembled in the tunnel of Juve's Comunale Stadium. Brian jabs his finger at a camera. Nurses wheel a gurney from an ambulance. Brian sits by Peter's hospital bedside. Brian smiles and looks away. Their eyes meet and hold a loaded look for a moment, before each drops his gaze. Brian storms into the Derby board meeting. Longson stares at the table as he smokes a cigar, while the other directors look away from Brian's plaintive looks. Shaking his head in disbelief, Brian wanders down to Longson, then hurls his tracksuit top on the table. Everyone gathered in the candlelit room turns to look at Peter. Brian crosses the room to Peter. Brian stands beside three grinning young men before the assembled press below the Leeds United sign in front of the stadium. Giles, Bremner and Hunter watch from the training ground. Now, Brian passes them in the tunnel. Brian stands with his back to the pitch in the players' tunnel. Brian smiles bitterly as Giles points past him, towards the empty stadium at the end of the tunnel. Brian's smile wilts as Giles turns and saunters off with the other players, who pat him on the back as they go. Alone, Brian turns slowly and makes his way up towards the pitch, gazing at the empty stands. Alone in his stark hotel room, Brian lies on his bed, smoking and drinking. He's staring at the little girl playing noughts and crosses with the toy clown on the television test-card. A woman rides a tricycle past beach huts on the seafront promenade. Girls flock across the beach by the pier. An elderly couple eat fish and chips. More middle-aged folks snooze in deck chairs in the hazy sunshine. Brian pulls up with Peter in his Ford Zodiac on the seafront. They stroll along the seafront passing a woman, hobbling with a Zimmer frame. Brian's eyes drift away as he frowns. Peter points over the street to a hotel. In the bar, the Brighton Chairman extends his hand to shake.",
    "1243": "Brian smiles wryly with his arms folded. He leans forward and shakes the chairman's hand. A crowded tourist beach by a Majorcan hotel. Bare-chested, Brian plays football with his kids. Peter cavorts around with them in the impromptu game. Fat holiday-makers laze on lounges. Brian kisses Peter's cheek playfully. A man smears some cream over his obese folds. Brian holds his arms aloft to celebrate scoring. Barbara frolics in the surf with Peter and the kids. Wearing aviator shades, Brian nods smiling. They beckon him to join them. His face becomes sober as he turns over to the back page of the paper to see the sport headline. By the hotel, a waiter points Brian out to a man in a panama hat and blazer. The middle-aged man wanders down the sandy beach carrying a briefcase towards Brian. Brian's now lying on his back in the sun. The man in the blazer dabs sweat from his face as he stands over Brian. Still wearing his shades and an intrigued expression, Brian raises himself up onto his elbows, looking up at Archer. Peter marches off along the jetty away from Brian, leaving him pacing furiously, hands on hips then on his head in despair. A home game. A Luton Town player in orange stripe weaves through the lead-footed Leeds midfield. Bremner sulks beside Clough on the bench. Behind them, Don makes his way to a seat with the directors. Don eyes Brian gloatingly. A Luton striker scores. The Leeds fans cheer as Brian escorts his team down the tunnel. Brian finds Cussins waiting. The Leeds players trudge into their dressing room. Cussins leaves Brian with his hands on his hips. Brian makes to follow Bremner into the dressing room, but has the door slammed in his face. The players now showered and in their fashionable clothes join the directors in the long, narrow lounge. Brian traipses in last to face Cussins. A player obliges. Cussins eyeballs Brian, then turns to the players. Brian wrinkles his nose with distaste as Bremner, sat beside Giles, winks at him. Brian nods and swallows hard. Brian's new young signings looked troubled as their manager steps into the corridor. Jimmy finds Brian outside the door. Manny Cussins in the board room. Brian smarts. He straightens his jacket and glances around the board members. Cussins glances at the other directors. Brian leads Nigel down the corridor. They pass Don's photo. Brian's in makeup for Yorkshire TV. The presenter knocks on the door. Brian winks and smiles wistfully. Now, in the studio. The floor manger leads Brian to his seat before the cameras. Brian notices two other chairs. Brian sits. The tall handsome presenter leads a bullish Don through the dark studio into the lights of the set.",
    "1244": "Don sits in the chair to Brian's left, the presenter to Brian's right. Brian shoots a scathing look at the presenter. Don smooths out his tie. The floor manager points at the presenter. Brian's grin sticks. Brian fades to silhouette as the lights dim. Brian nods bitterly as Don and the presenter rise from their seats and stroll away across the studio floor. Still sat in his chair, brooding introspectively, Brian glances over at the TV crew who wander out of the cavernous studio as the lights go out. Brian sits in the darkness on set, the switched off cameras pointing away from him. Brian drives past Elland Road in his Blue Merc with Nigel and Simon in the back. The lads read comics and annuals as Brian broods at the wheel. He looks in the mirror at them. The boys swap wide-eyed looks on the back seat. Brian smiles as the boys stifle giggles. The boys huddle close behind Brian, excitedly. The chalk cliffs of the south coast. Girls wheel over the Brighton Promenade in the sunshine. Brian stops the car outside a large red brick house. Peter's wandering among the shrubs and plants in his front garden. He looks over at Brian in his car. He stoops over a flowerbed. His eyes fixed on Peter, Brian gets out wearing a heavy frown. Still bent over the flowerbed, Peter glances over at Brian then carries on weeding. Brian puts his hands in his pockets as he strolls up the drive. Peter shoots Brian a withering look. Peter looks down at his plants. Then, he steps back with his hands on his hips, admiring them. Eventually, he turns to Brian with disdain. Peter turns back around. Peter takes a step closer to kneeling Brian, scrutinizing him. Peter points at Brian. The boys exchange puzzled looks in the car. Peter walks closer and stops. Peter strolls towards his house, then turns back. Brian fixes Peter with a sincere, imploring look. Peter looks at Brian, then hangs his head and shakes it. He rubs the finger of his clenched fists together. Then, he raises his open hands out towards Brian. Brian stands and walks towards his old friend. Brian throws his arms around Peter and hugs him close. Peter screws his eyes up and returns the embrace. Then, he scowls. Brian is wide eyed as he speaks into Peter's ear. Peter blinks slowly and shakes his head. A tender smile spreads across Brian's face. He tightens his embrace and closes his eyes. They step back and look at each other. Peter thumps Brian's shoulder playfully. Peter nods over Brian's shoulder towards the boys in the car. Brian beckons to them. The boys scamper to Peter.",
    "1245": "She wipes mist off her bathroom mirror and brushes her teeth. Elsewhere in New York City, some very fashionable ladies are also getting dressed. The model-type women put on expensive-looking designer underwear. Andy roots through a jumbled drawer and pulls out a serviceable pair of white pants. One of the women, a fashionable blonde, selects a jacket from her extensive walk-in wardrobe. Another lady carefully coordinates her brown top with just the right skirt. Then, the fashionable ladies put on their designer make up working to achieve a flawless finish. In contrast, pretty Andy has put on a comfortable-looking mauve jumper over a white shirt and trousers, and dabs on a bit of lip gloss. The fashionable ladies make their jewelry selections, while Andy consults her appointment book. Andy flips through some political articles she wrote for the university newspaper. The well-dressed ladies pull on their high-heeled shoes and boots. Andy kisses scruffy boyfriend Nate goodbye as he sits reading in bed. The fashionable ladies scoop up their designer phones and bags and leave their swanky uptown apartments. Unfashionable Andy, who is slender and has long, dark hair, walks out of her downtown apartment followed by a gaggle of young schoolchildren out on a trip. A model-type measures out a small amount of cereal and adds some nuts to her breakfast. Andy stops at a bakery and walks down the street, unashamedly munching on an onion bagel. The fashionable ladies flag down taxicabs and get into chauffeur-driven cars, whilst Andi heads cheerfully down into the subway in her rather shapeless brown coat and clunky black heels. Andi makes her way down a busy city street, as smartly dressed businesspeople dash this way and that. Skyscrapers loom overhead on either side of the street. She arrives at a tall building housing Elias-Clark Publications and gazes up at its impressive facade. Clutching her battered, brown leather briefcase, she takes a deep breath and walks into the marble-floored reception hall and up to the desk. An elegant redhead is waiting. Andy follows Emily. Emily's BlackBerry. Emily springs into action as a sleek, silver car pulls up outside. Creative director Nigel leaves. Andy checks her onion breath. A chauffeur-driven car pulls up outside the building. Chic, grey-haired Editor-in-Chief Miranda Priestly gets out, carrying a designer handbag and a mockup of the magazine. Emily dashes into Miranda's office, puts a glass down on her desk, and fills it with mineral water. Andy watches a member of the editorial staff quickly binning her breakfast, and another changing her shoes. A woman uses a webcamming feature on her computer to touch up her makeup. Emily arranges a pile of magazines on Miranda's desk before quickly tidying up her own.",
    "1247": "Andy goes in and leans on the desk. He pokes her forehead. Her face brightens. He reads her smile. A huge clothes storeroom. Made over and looking fabulous with her freshly fringed glossy hair and an elegant black jacket and trousers on, Andy strides past Serena and Emily and gets the phone. Emily glares at Serena. Nate leaves the restaurant he chefs in. Nate pulls on his jacket and heads down the street, walking straight past Andy, who is leaning against a car waiting for him. He stops and looks back, taking in her new look from top to toe. The Chanel boots, the slinky jacket, the gold necklaces, the lipstick and the sleek hairdo. Andy walks to the subway wearing a stylish green coat and shades, with white gloves on and a cute bag. Another day, she walks the same boot with a black coat on, an orange hat and a different designer handbag. Now, she emerges from the subway in a white coat to match her beat cap with yet another desirable handbag on her shoulder. Andy runs into work across the foyer in heels and a chic black coat, her dark hair scooped up in a bun. Now, wearing a gorgeous flowing black outfit with knee length boots and a long pendant necklace, Andy's arranging magazines on Miranda's desk when Miranda arrives. Miranda takes in Andy's outfit and then continues her call. Nate dough and Lily in her restaurant. A bag for Lily. Andy's mates giggle. She walks out. Andy gets out of the back of a sleek black car and makes her way to a loft in a fashionable apartment building. She rings the bell. Andy sashays down the hall in her black outfit with a big pendant necklace, and approaches a sophisticated looking couple. He hands her a black portfolio. They go to the bar. Suave James hands her a glass. He goes and a handsome curly-haired guy approached Andy. Andy puts down her glass. Andy smiles and takes her leave. Christian watches her go. Miranda's in her office going through James Holt's portfolio. She's wearing a crisp black suit and her shock of grey- white hair is expertly coiffured. In the anteroom, Emily points at Andy, who hurries into the office in a smart black mini dress with white colors and cuffs. Miranda purses her lips at James' red dress. Leaving the showroom. Andy follows Miranda. Back at the office. The key. Emily approaches Andy's desk. A car drops Andy off. Andy does so. Andy falters in the foyer as there are three closet doors to choose from. There are various different tables in the foyer, all with flowers on them. Andy looks up the spiral staircase and sees the twins looking over the banister rail on an upper level.",
    "1249": "Emily is standing on the stairs with another couple. She spots Andy. Inside at the benefit, Emily and Andy follow Miranda around as she greets guests, prompting her as to who they are. Miranda's wearing a black, off-the-shoulder gown. Andy spots Chairman Irv Ravitz with a chic lady on his arm. A tissue. A man waves at Miranda and turns to Emily. Andy steps back. Emily looks gratefully at Andy, who smiles. Later, Andy is hurrying out of the benefit when she meets Christian coming up the steps. Christian heads into the benefit. Andy is being driven home through the busy New York streets. Andy finds Nate watching TV alone. Andy shuts the door, puts down her bags and walks over to him, carrying a single fairy cake with a lit candle on it. Dark-haired Nate looks morose. He sits forward. He stops in the doorway and turns back to look at her, shaking his head sadly. Hanging his head, he turns and mooches off into the bedroom. Looking glum, Andy blows out the candle on the cake. Andy lets herself into Miranda's townhouse, carrying Miranda's dry cleaning and the book. She's wearing a cool monochrome outfit with black trousers and pale boots and a big, floppy cap on her head. She puts the dry cleaning into the correct closet and is about to leave the book when. Andy's being summoned from one of the other rooms, but she can't see Miranda. She yanks her cap off and smooths her fringe before heading in. Miranda's in a chair in the lounge. Andy hands it to her. Miranda rises, sternly. Andy looks down. Miranda has turned her attention to the book. Andy stands and stares at her with her big doe eyes for a moment, then leaves. Andy strolls sadly through the city, mulling over her decision. It's dark and the swanky shop windows she passes are all lit up. She passes people sitting at tables outside a restaurant. She shakes her head and moves on. Yellow taxicabs pass her on the street as she walks past shop windows, one displaying a fashionable red coat. Back at home, Nate wanders out of the bedroom and finds Andy looking through some of her old articles and photographs, including one of her with her parents. She picks up another photograph. Nate's shoulders sag and he heads back into the bedroom and turns out the light. Andy rubs her neck, trying to ease some of the tension. Andy is at work early. Miranda's office is empty and so is Emily's chair. Andy stairs across the anteroom at it, then picks up a clipboard and some papers. Miranda comes in, unbuttoning her coat, which has a striped collar.",
    "125": "She leads him towards the door. On the way he picks up his hat. In the BACKGROUND Dietrichson begins to ascend the stairs, carrying his coat and glass. Phyllis and Neff move close to the door. Phyllis opens the door a crack. Both look at the stairs, where Dietrichson is going up. Phyllis takes her hand off the doorknob and holds on to Neff's arm. They look at each other. The look is like a long kiss. Neff goes out. Neff, briefcase under his arm, comes down the steps to the street, where his Dodge coupe is parked at the curb. He opens the door and stops, looking in. Sitting there in the dark corner of the car, away from the steering wheel, is Lola. She wears a coat but no hat. Lola gives him a sly smile. Neff is a little annoyed. Neff gets into the car. Neff puts the briefcase on the ledge behind the driver's seat. He closes the door and starts the car. They drift down the hill. Neff looks at her curiously. Lola meets his glance. Neff brings the car to a stop by the curb. He turns around and looks towards the car. Zachetti walks towards the car. Neff and Lola. She has opened the door. Zachetti comes up. Lola steps out of the car. Lola catches up with Zachetti and they walk away together. Slowly he puts the car in gear and drives on. His face is tight. Behind his head, light catches the metal of the zipper on the briefcase. There is a fair amount of activity but the place is not crowded. Neff comes along the sidewalk into the shot. He passes in front of the fruit and vegetable display and goes between the stalls into the market. Neff stops by the cashier's desk and buys a pack of cigarettes. As he is opening the pack he looks back casually beyond the turnstile into the rear part of the market. The shelves are loaded with canned goods and other merchandise. Customers move around selecting articles and putting them in their baskets. Phyllis is seen among them, standing by the soap section. Her basket is partly filled. She wears a simple house dress, no hat, and has a large envelope pocketbook under her arm. Phyllis is putting a can of cleaning powder into her basket. Neff enters the shot and moves along the shelves towards her, very slowly, pretending to inspect the goods. A customer passes and goes on out of scene. Phyllis and Neff are now very close. During the ensuing low-spoken dialogue, they continue to face the shelves, not looking at each other. She hesitates, then opens it. Neff looks around quickly, slips the policy out of his pocket and drops it into her bag.",
    "1251": "Andy holds out a folder, which Miranda ungraciously accepts. Andy's taken aback. She glances down at the papers in her lap, and then looks across at Miranda with sympathy. Miranda hands back the seating chart. Back in her own suite, Andy has changed into a slim-fitting low cut black suit. She studies her reflection in a big mirror and touches up the mascara on her long, black lashes. Nigel comes in and studies the outfit she's wearing. Andy and Christian are in an elegant restaurant. They raise their glasses. After dinner, they stroll near the Notredam Cathedral. She swings around a lamppost. Christian kisses her. He kisses her again and again. She kisses him back, wrapping her arm around his neck. They are surrounded by bare trees adorned with fairy lights. There's a view of the Eiffel Tower from Christian's hotel bedroom window. Andy wakes up in his bed alone, and puts her hand to her head with a grimace. She rolls over and consults her watch on the bedside table. She pulls on her clothes and is hopping around trying to put her shoes on. Andy goes to grab her jacket and knocks over Christian's bag. Christian comes out of the bathroom in a towel. Andy grabs her stuff and goes. Walking along a modern bridge over the sand, she calls Miranda's suite. Andy gets back to the hotel and pauses before knocking on Miranda's door. Miranda and Irv shut the door in her face. She's changed into a black dress with a scoop neck, a full skirt with petticoats, and wears black gloves and a silver necklace. At the event, she paces the hallway. Nigel steps down from the podium. Miranda makes her way over from the table she's been sitting at. They had gathered in a plush banqueting suite with chandeliers hanging from the ceiling. Andy spies Christian sitting with Jacqueline. Miranda kisses Nigel before taking her place. James gets up and salutes his fans. Andy and Nigel smile over at him. Nigel's excited smile fades and he looks up at Miranda crestfallen. Pretty Jacqueline beams delightedly. Nigel puts on a brave face and applauds her. Jacqueline stands. Andy looks over at Miranda incredulously. Up on the podium, Miranda smiles and applauds Jacqueline as Irv eyes her coolly. Andy glances over at Christian, who looks stunned. James preens himself smugly. Nigel fidgets in his seat. Later, Andy gets into the back of a smart, black executive car, which is parked outside the venue.",
    "1252": "The car drives off down the chic Parisian street. Andy stares out of the window. A melancholy expression's on her face, not looking at Miranda who sits beside her. Flashback of Irv looking at the list. Andy turns and looks at Miranda. Andy frowns and shakes her head. Andy turns and looks out of the window. The two women stare at one another. Miranda puts on a pair of large sunglasses, smiles at Andy and steps out of the car. A swarm of photographers are waiting hungrily outside of the entrance of a grand building. Andy gets out of the car and watches Miranda as she makes her way through the throng. Andy ponders for a moment, then turns and walks off in the opposite direction. Expecting Andy to be behind her, Miranda turns back to address her. She looks around in confusion, then sees her young assistant striding off across the road. Looking slightly perturbed, Miranda carries on inside. Andy walks towards an ornate green and gold fountain. Andy throws the phone into the fountain. With a smile on her face, Andy strolls off along the Place de la Concorde. The Eiffel Tower, just visible in the distance. The Manhattan and Brooklyn suspension bridges stretch across the east river, which flows through the endless sprawl of buildings that make up New York City. A casually-dressed Andy is sitting in a coffee shop reading a newspaper. She looks up as Nate walks in and sits down in front of her. Andy stares down for a moment, then looks at Nate earnestly. Nate gazes into Andy's sad eyes. A smile flickers across his lips. He leans back in his seat. Nate nods. Andy looks down wistfully. Andy smiles. Nate shrugs. She looks up at him. Nate beams at her. Andy smiles back, then looks down coyly. Andy gapes. As she walks down a set of steps leading to the pavement, a smile spreads across her face. Dressed in smart jeans, a black polo neck and a brown jacket, and still wearing a large grin, Andy walks down a busy street. She takes a mobile phone from her bag and begins to dial. Emily gapes in surprise, then composes herself. Emily hangs up, looking genuinely touched. She allows herself a brief smile, then looks over at Andy's replacement. Out on the street, Andy's smile fades as she see Miranda leaving the building. Miranda finishes talking on her mobile as a silver Mercedes pulls up. As Miranda, who's wearing large Jackie O-style sunglasses, makes to get into the car, she suddenly spots Andy standing across the street. The two women regard each other for a moment, then Andy smiles and raises her hand in a wave.",

A brown-haired guy in his 40s, Carl, rejects a call from an unknown caller. He stares down blankly. He tenses. He takes the phone out again. He hangs up again. He takes his phone out and fumbles. He accidentally answers it and sighs. He holds it to his ear. Carl turns to the window. Peter waves. Carl moves his mouth. Grumpily, Carl hangs up. At the Bigfoot Lodge. A ring. They all turn to gawk. The guy nuzzles her. Carl eyes Rooney. Ted and Stephanie frown at him. He bashes into a waitress and slips. He ends up on the floor with a tray of drinks. He stands. Stiff as a board, he trudges off past a crowd of staring people. At home, Carl dons a suit jacket and studies his reflection in the mirror. He pops a name badge into his pocket. Then smiles at himself. As he leaves his apartment, a small white-haired woman creeps up behind him. She smiles. Outside a cafe. A guy bins a flyer. Carl sits at his computer. He spots a colleague springing out of his chair. Norman hangs up. Carl swallows. Outside the bank, he rejects another call from an unknown caller. He sits down on a wall. He takes out a leaflet. Carl frowns. Nick leans over Carl. Nick lobs the rock. Nick's open-mouthed as two security guards run out of the building. One of them takes him down. The other one leaps on top. Nick leaps over a wall. Carl's in his car. He rejects an unknown caller. He winds up his window as a guy selling oranges approaches. He passes the man outside the cafe. At his desk. Carl browses DVDs in the video store. He sits alone on the sofa in his smart apartment. He watches a film. Carl frowns and pauses the film. He goes to the door and peeps through the spyhole. Peter hurries off. Carl shuts his door with a worried expression. Peter and Rooney enter Carl's flat. Rooney goes to the fridge. Peter heads over towards the sofa. Peter furrows his brow and studies something. He's contorted but stiff. A fly lands on Carl's eye. Carl wakes from his nightmare and sits up with a start. He's on the couch. He's wide-eyed and disheveled. He stares into space miserably and swallows. He frowns. Thoughtfully, he gazes down at something on the table. He examines it. He makes his way towards the rows of seats. He sits down. On two screens. Carl jumps out of his skin.",
    "1255": "She looks at Carl with a suspicious frown. She takes a photo. She smiles. The woman halts cheekily. Carl smiles then turns away. He eyes her scooter. They tear down a road on the scooter. Carl sits behind the woman, Allison. He wears the helmet and clings onto her. They weave in and out of the other traffic. She speeds up, overtaking two vehicles. Allison holds up her camera to take a picture. She veers across the road onto the wrong side. Oncoming cars swerve. They head up a tree-lined hill. In the park by Carl's car. He pours petrol into his car. He breaks into a smile. He hands it back to her. He gazes at her feigning surprise. Wearing the helmet, she marches over to him. She presses herself against him and kisses him hard on the lips. She draws back. He's dumbfounded. He gazes at her as she gets back onto her scooter. She drives off with a smile. His eyes follow her as she goes. He turns back slowly, smiling to himself. He looks down. He's holding the Polaroid of them on the scooter in his hand. He scrutinizes the photo, nods and smiles. His eyes dart around nervously. He puts the petrol cap back on. He smiles. Nods and checks out the photo of him and Allison. Norman punches the air. Norman smiles wistfully. Carl sits in front of his computer at the bank. Three guys stare at him. He clicks to enlarge another pop-up. A corpulent woman heads over. She gawks at him. The woman beams. Carl stamps the form with an approved stamp. A slice has been cut from the cake. Carl high-fives him. Carl forces a grin. At the Bigfoot Lodge, Carl, Peter and Rooney sit in a booth. Carl glances at Rooney. Carl, Peter and Rooney slam down shot glasses. Carl spits out a lime. Carl snorts Tabasco sauce off his hand. Grimacing, he slams his fists on the table. He knocks over all the glasses. Carl plays on an arcade dance game. The figure and arrows on the screen show Carl which moves to execute. He stands on a platform with arrows to the right, left, back and front. He has to move his feet to the correct place to the beat. A crowd has gathered to watch him. He moves quickly, hopping about its spinning around. He's getting a perfect score. Peter and Rooney smile and cheer. He moves nimbly then twirls with his leg out. People have to duck out of the way. Finally, he collapses backwards. Peter and Rooney catch him. Carl snogs her. A big burly guy approaches. Rooney frowns. Outside, Carl is down. He crashes into a bin.",
    "1256": "Peter and Rooney go to his aid. They prop up the smiling Carl. Carl punches a random guy in the face. The burly guy knees him in the gut. The burly guy is restrained. Carl's face falls. He looks as if he's on the verge of tears. At home, Carl lies beside his toilet. His legs wrapped around the toilet bowl and his head near the door. He stirs. He opens his eyes. They flit from side to side. He smiles. Carl leaves his apartment and locks his door. He turns to find elderly, white-haired Tillie holding a hammer. She smiles and shrugs. Carl puts up shelves at Tillie's. Tillie knits while he drills. Tillie shakes her head. His shirt is trapped in the door. He tugs at his shirt. He yanks his shirt out and rolls backwards down a flight of steps. He sits up to see a scary dog charging towards him. The dog's chain stops it just short of Carl. Carl is frozen in terror, as the dog snaps its jaws inches from his face. A look of pained realization comes over him. Tillie pushes Carl back onto her bed. Tillie puts her false teeth into a glass. At work, Carl looks at an invitation on his computer. In his office Norman receives the response. Beaming, he gawks at the screen. Norman springs out of his chair excitedly. He gives Carl the thumbs up through the glass wall of his office. Carl salutes him. He salutes back. Carl pulls a silly face. Norman hides behind a wall then jumps out. Carl pretends to look away, then looks back at him sharply. Norman turns his glasses upside down and flaps around like a bird. Without his glasses on Norman crosses his eyes and holds his hands out. Carl winds sticky tape around his head. Carl tapes his nose up so it looks like a pig's snout. Carl's face looks deformed and lumpy. He sticks out his teeth. Norman looks uncomfortable and retreats. He takes out cash. A bed is delivered. Carl jumps on his new bed. He's balanced a glass of wine on the corner. It doesn't fall over. In a guy's room, Carl learns to play guitar. Carl takes off in a light aircraft. An instructor is beside him. Carl sits at a desk in a Korean class. His classmates laugh. The teacher gives him a withering look. He ladles soup for homeless people. The vagrant's on his phone. Carl snatches a flier from the guy outside the cafe. He pauses and checks his flier. Inside, Carl walks up to the bar and sits. It's the guy from outside the cafe. The guy walks up to the barman.",
    "1257": "On stage, a band who wears seahorses on their heads. Carl turns to look. Allison walks onstage. Carl shakes his head incredulously. Allison plays a keyboard. She wears a spangly mini top hat. Carl stands with his hand on his heart. Carl grins. Carl gazes at her. She pouts at the crowd, then furrows her brow. Carl sits at the bar with a bottle of beer. Smiling, Allison sashays up beside him. Carl sits at the bar, smiling and waiting. She glances over and beams. He looks down. They walk in the middle of a dark street. They reach her scooter. Wrinkling her nose, she smiles. They smile. Carl throws himself into bed and sets an alarm clock. He puts it on his bedside table and switches off his lamp. He scowls at his phone, then answers it. He switches the lamp on again. Early morning joggers stretch in front of a large observatory with three domes. A car races up the hill and comes to a halt. Carl climbs out, cans of energy drinks tumbling out when he opens the door. He removes a can stuck to his shoe. He runs over. He punches the air and bounds off. He sprints down a hill. The others jog behind. They take snaps on their cameras. Carl leaps onto a bench by a couple hugging. He snaps them with his phone, then darts off again. The group jog along a pathway on a hillside. They find Carl collapsed on the ground, his eyes closed. Allison squats and starts snapping Carl. Everyone else does the same thing. Allison and Carl stand together at the top of the hill. Carl downs a bottle of water, then gasps in air. He pretends to write notes. He nods thoughtfully. She slaps him across the arm. Carl and Peter eat in the garden of a restaurant. Carl downs a glass of water. A Persian woman. Carl picks up a basket that Peter's food was in. Peter stands to kiss Lucy. They sit. Faranoush beams at her. Lucy stares, flabbergasted. Norman opens his front door. They're dressed as Harry, Ron and Hermione. The others stare. Guests play a game of mock Quidditch. Carl smiles. The first Harry Potter film. Norman gazes at the screen and waves. Carl and Allison stand up to leave. Carl freezes. The party guests clap. Norman lets them out. Carl and Allison zoom down a dark street on Allison's scooter. Carl sits behind her with his arms around her waist. The scooter wobbles unsteadily. Carl's driving. He smiles nervously. He eyes something on the other side of the street. He grins. Carl and Allison hurry towards a chain-link fence. It has a gate which is locked.",
    "1260": "Two safety guys stand by. Carl dives off. He free-falls hundreds of feet towards a river, then gets whipped back up by the heavy-duty elastic. Waving his arms, Carl swings back and forth beneath the giant, curved bridge supports. He takes out his phone. Wes is on a golf course. He hands his phone to a caddy. At Norm's, Norm is having a Sparta-themed party. Norm wears a red cape and holds a shield and spear. Later, he sits, weeping. Carl's beside him, looking anxious, with his hand on Norm's shoulder. Norm's wearing a false beard and mustache. Carl notices the mustache is slipping and sticks it back in place. He looks down humbly. At home, Carl checks his answer phone. At the Bigfoot Lodge, the sign shows an ominous figure in a forest. Carl stands outside the entrance looking pensive. Peter and Lucy walk up. Carl leads them inside. Carl and Peter dance. Janet offers a piece of cake to Lee. Faranoush looks again. Norm's leaning against the bar, looking morose. Carl taps him on his left shoulder and leans round to his right. Norm bows. With his hand on Soo-Mi's shoulder, Norm dances around as they walk off. Lucy's with a group of friends. Carl catches her eye, smiles and waves. Lucy points around the room and gives Carl a big thumbs-up. They share a fond smile. Sitting alone at a table, Carl makes a phone call. Allison's at an exhibition of her photos. She opens then closes her phone. A woman's looking at the photo of Carl sprawled on the ground. Allison smiles tightly, and the woman raises her eyebrows. Peter sits next to Carl. Peter smiles. Rooney stands at the bar alone. Tillie walks up and smiles at him broadly. He looks at her warily. Rooney has a drink. He knocks back a shot. He ushers her out of the bar, looking back cautiously as he goes. Carl arrives home. She kisses him. He responds and kisses her for a moment, then pulls away sharply. He looks pained. Carl gets into an elevator and presses a button. The doors close. As the elevator descends, the light flickers. Carl looks up. The elevator stalls. The doors open. It's stuck below the level of the floor. Carl clambers out and walks off along the hall, looking around cautiously. As Carl walks across the forecourt, a black cat runs past behind him. Carl stumbles onto a car bonnet. He sees a guy hooking his car up to a tow truck. The guy is Carl. Carl runs from his hallucination. Terrence drives away from a hotel. Carl pops up in the back of the car, and Terrence hits the gas.",
    "1264": "Stemming the flow of blood from Snape's neck, with one hand, Harry holds the phial to Snape's cheek. Catches his tears in it. Harry removes the phial from Snape's cheek. Harry grips the phial. Snape studies Harry's face. Harry's lips tremble. Snape's eyes glaze over. His head lolls to one side. Hermione glances briefly at Ron. Then, looks down at the floor. Harry stares at the dead Snape. The surface of the water starts to ripple. The building trembles. Harry steadies himself against the glass wall. Ron holds onto the door. Hermione clasps her hands to her ears. Fred Weasley is injured. Distressed, Hermione and Ron stand a little way behind Harry. It's still dark. Pockets of fire burn throughout the school and grounds as the three friends make their way back up the path, to the courtyard. Ron pushes open the doors of the Great Hall. The three are confronted by piles of rubble. Further in, they see students and staff. Two students carry someone out on a stretcher. Ron spots something and hurries forward. Hermione follows. Harry stands frozen in the doorway. Slughorn is tending to the wounded Filch. He turns. Harry passes a long line of people, being treated. Professor Trelawney and Padma Patil pull a blanket up over a dead body. Harry sees the Weasleys up ahead. Weeping, George clings to his father and hugs Ron, desperately. Fleur comforts Bill. Distraught, Molly kneels beside Fred's body. Stroking his hair. Ron joins her, sobbing helplessly. Hermione stands at a distance. Harry watches the grieving family. Harry glances to his left, and sees the bodies of Nymphadora and Remus, lying side by side on stretchers. Remus' little finger rests on hers. Professor McGonagall limps towards Harry. Without seeing her, Harry turns and strides out of the Great Hall. He enters Dumbledore's old office which is undamaged. As he steps further in, covered doors to his right open of their own accord. A stone pedestal slides out. Harry crosses to the pedestal. Lifts out a shallow silver basin. He gently spins it through the air. It floats towards the desk at the far side of the room. He follows the spinning basin, the Pensieve, to the desk, where it lands, lightly. Holding the phial containing Snape's tears, Harry removes the stopper. Empties the contents into the basin. He sees misty black swirls appear in the Pensieve. Harry sinks his face into the bowl. The swirling black clears to reveal a meadow. Two young girls stand, facing each other. It's his mother, Lily and her sister, Petunia. Lily opens her palm to reveal a daisy growing in it. An equally young Severus Snape emerges from a large tree trunk. Petunia runs off.",
    "1265": "Snape bends down and picks a plant with two leaves, which flutter like wings. He guides it to Lily. The red-haired Lily smiles at the boy Severus. He glances at her. Then, they both look up at the Willow tree above them. The wind rustles the branches and the leaves fall flying like tiny birds. The fluttering leaves skim over the water. The image changes. Lily wears the Sorting Hat. She glances at Severus as she walks down the hall. At the dining table, another boy sits beside her. Pale-faced Severus looks at her, doe-eyed. James smiles at Lily, who gazes back at him. Lily and James, kiss and dance. Voldemort kills Lily. An image of Wormtail. Snape's face softens. Dumbledore's blackened hand. Draco and the vanishing cabinet. The night of Dumbledore's death, which Harry witnessed on the Astronomy tower. Images of Voldemort, and Harry, restless in his sleep. The night of Lily's death. Snape enters the bedroom in the house in Godric's Hollow and finds her dead, beside Harry's cot. Snape is overcome with grief. He gazes at her lying lifeless on the floor. There are tears in baby Harry's eyes. A raw, jagged scar in his forehead. Teenage Harry peers through a doorway. Snape raises his wand, and completes two circles, in the air. Creating white wisps of cloud. They gather to form a Patronus in the shape of a beautiful silver doe. It leaps out through a window. Longingly, Snape watches it leave. Dumbledore spins around, mouth agape. Snape rocks Lily's lifeless body in his arms. Snape's face is somber. In the forest, Harry sees the doe approach. The black swirls and the Pensieve return. Harry lifts his head out of the bowl. His eyes are wide and anxious. Dazed, he slowly backs away, holding his hand to his heart. Harry sits down on a step. His face is unshaven and dirty. He stares ahead blankly. He sits motionless. Harry walks downstairs along pathways cleared amongst the rubble. He turns on a landing, and sees Hermione and Ron sitting together on a step, further down. He pauses, stares at them, and descends. They start to follow him. Hermione holds Ron's arm. Hermione fights back tears. She rushes forward and flings her arms around his neck. Over her shoulders, Harry glances at Ron, who lowers his gaze for a moment. Hermione unwraps her arms from around Harry. They separate. Harry takes his leave and Ron moves over to Hermione. Side by side, they watch as Harry slowly makes his way down the stone staircase. Outside, Harry walks slowly across the deserted courtyard. The remnants of flickering fires cast his shadow before him. Harry enters The Forbidden Forest. Treading carefully, he stops by a tree.",
    "1266": "He turns and checks behind him. He turns back, and lifts up the golden snitch bequeathed to him, by Dumbledore. The writing on it appears. Harry studies it. He lifts the golden snitch to his mouth, and presses it to his lips. The outer casing opens. The inner casing revolves to create an opening. Inside, a polished octagonal stone. On one surface, a circle is inscribed inside a triangle down the middle of which, one is a line. The stone floats out of the snitch. Harry places the palm of his right hand, under the floating stone. He carefully clenches his fist around it. His eyes are closed. Harry slowly opens them, and stares ahead. In front of him, stand his parents, with Sirius and Remus. Lily stretches out her hand. Harry goes to take it. But, his hand passes right through hers. They gaze at each other. Lily lowers her hand. Lily smiles. Harry turns to Sirius and takes a few paces forward. Harry Nods, his father, James. Harry turns and gazes at his mother, then moves towards her. He looks across at his father. Sirius points at Harry's heart. Once again, Harry's gaze lights upon his mother. Harry unclenches his fist. The Resurrection Stone falls gently onto the forest floor. Voldemort stands in a clearing in the forest. Voldemort opens his eyes and glares at the gaunt-faced Death Eater. Bellatrix Lestrange walks up behind Voldemort, who takes a few paces forward. He turns around. Bellatrix lowers her head reverentially as he passes her, the Elder Wand clasped in his right hand. He stops and half turns his head. Bellatrix peers through the gloom and sees Harry coming into the clearing. Voldemort flexes his neck and looks back over his shoulder. He turns to face Harry. Hagrid sees him. Voldemort stares at the teenager who stands unwavering in front of him. Nagini slithers past Hagrid towards Voldemort, who steadies himself and raises his wand. Harry stands, unflinching. Harry closes his eyes. A stream of green light flashes from the Elder Wand and hits Harry full on. Bright white light. Harry comes too. He's clean shaven, unbruised, and without his spectacles. He stands, silhouetted against a completely white background. Behind him in the whiteness there's a small bench. He walks over to it and bends down to peer underneath the bench. He recoils when he sees a tiny, skeletal, red, raw naked figure curled up in a fetal position. Dumbledore steps towards him. Dumbledore wears a silvery white robe in the vista of white. Harry looks around. He glances back at the fetal figure. They stroll along the platform and sit down on a bench. Dumbledore gets to his feet.",
    "1270": "Harry and Ron are standing by Dobby's grave when Bellatrix approaches them. Hermione has transformed to look exactly like Bellatrix. Reluctantly, Griphook slides the sword into her bottomless bag. She joins Harry and Ron, who is disguised as a long-haired, bearded Death Eater. Ron holds out his hand, palm upwards. Hermione and Harry grasp his outstretched hand. Harry turns to Griphook. Griphook places his hand on the others. They apparate in a dark and gloomy street by Gringott's Bank. A cloaked man spots Hermione, who walks ahead of the others. The cloaked man moves away. Harry bends down and Griphook climbs on his back. Ron flings the invisibility cloak over them. Standing in the imposing banking hall, Hermione glances anxiously back at Ron, then stares wide-eyed at the rows of goblin tellers ahead of them. Hermione teeters in her unaccustomed heeled shoes. As a goblin teller looks up, she tries to look austere as she swaggers along. Wearing a long, black coat, Ron walks behind her, his head bowed. Hidden under the invisibility cloak, Harry and Griphook follow. Harry spots an armed guard. Like Bellatrix, Hermione has a stand of long, black hair over her right eye. She stops in front of a wizened old goblin behind a high desk. The goblin continues to write in his ledger. Arms folded, she regards him haughtily. He looks down at her. He turns and leaves his desk. A teller looks up. Griphook whispers to Ron. Ron sees an armed guard slowly pacing towards them. The old teller returns to his desk with Bogrod, a bespectacled goblin. Under the cloak, Harry and Griphook have moved nearer the desk and stand beside Bogrod. Harry casts a spell. Bogrod's demeanor changes, and he smiles benignly. Griphook is driving a cart along a twisting rail track, hurtling through dark, underground tunnels. Harry and Ron sit on his right and Hermione on his left. Bogrod, in his happy, mesmerized state, sits behind his fellow goblin, facing back of the track. Traveling at incredible speed, the cart's single headlight illuminates a waterfall gushing beneath the track. Griphook brakes desperately. The track twists down towards the waterfall. They pass through the cascade, and the rail-cart comes to a halt. An alarm is activated. They're tipped out of the cart and plummet. They stops falling, then land safely. All five get to their feet and look up at the cart as it trundles away. Harry turns to Ron and Hermione. Ron recast the spell on Bogrod, who smiles benignly. Ron leads them in semi-darkness towards a cavern. A huge, gray, spiky dragon lies chained on the ground. Griphook takes something from an opened wooden crate and hands it to Ron.",
    "1271": "The dragon rises. It breathes fire, then cowers as Griphook shakes a bell. Ron shakes the bell given to him by the goblin. They ease past the dragon. They continue along a narrow passageway and reach a door. Griphook presses Bogrod's hand into the locking mechanism. Bogrod grins inanely as the door opens. The dragon belches flame as they enter the vault and close the door. Light appears at the tip of their three wands. The vault is filled with treasure. Gold and silver goblets, candlesticks, jewels, and stacks of coins. Harry walks further into the vault. Harry moves ahead of the others. He stops, turns his head, blinks, then stares up at something. It's a gold cup with two handles. Hermione dislodges a ring. It replicates. Other objects start to replicate. Hermione throws it to him. Catching it, Harry wades through the growing mass of treasure. Up to his knees, Harry scrambles over the treasure towards the cup. The treasure is now waist height. Harry stretches the sword high above his head, reaching for the cup. He disappears from sight, lost in a mountain of gold and silver treasure. The others remain stock-still. He stumbles. He drops the cup. Griphook grabs it. Harry tosses him the sword. He flings the cup to Hermione. Griphook presses Bogrod's hand against the door. Replicating treasure tumbles out through the open doorway. The three are buried inside the vault. Griphook rings the bells to keep the dragon at bay. Harry struggles out of the vault and runs to a balustrade. Griphook runs off, leaving the grinning Bogrod alone with the dragon. The dragon raises its head and breathes fire, incinerating Bogrod. Armed guards rush in, throwing explosive bursts from their wands. She destroys the balustrade and, taking a run-up leaps through the opening onto the dragon's back. Clinging to its spikes, she hauls herself up. The beast belches flame. Goblins take cover. Ron and Harry are still by the vault. They leap onto the dragon's back. Her spell releases the dragon's chains. It breathes fire and looks up towards a pinprick of light high above. The three friends cling on desperately as the dragon climbs towards the light. A guard shoots from an approaching rail cart. The dragon knocks the track with its head. The cart and its passengers plummet. All is quiet in the banking hall. Rows of tellers pore over ledgers. Above their heads, a chandelier starts to sway. A teller looks up. The dragon bursts through a grating in the floor. Guards and goblins flee the flames. The dragon's head hits the chandelier. The three cling on as the dragon bursts its way through a glass dome onto the roof.",
    "1272": "The three friends hang onto the dragon's horny spikes, with Hermione on one side, Ron and Harry on the other. It takes flight, clumsily buffeting to rooftops and chimneypots before soaring into the air with the Thames winding far below. The wind ruffles their hair as the dragon flies off, heading west along the river. They soar through clouds towards it. The dragon's outstretched wings barely move as the currents of air carry it along. They fly low over the river. As they plunge deep into the water, Harry sees an image of Voldemort. The dark lord attacks a bank guard. A finger recoils from a glowing ring. Tom Riddle's scorched diary. The Horcrux locket. Voldemort spins. Harry surfaces. More images. Ron destroying the locket with the Sword of Gryffindor. The dark lord roars. Hogwarts School. A dark-haired woman. A banner with the eagle of the House of Ravenclaw. The two-handled gold cup. Voldemort frowns, eyes staring. Voldemort turns uneasily. Harry surfaces again. He swims towards the shore. All three clamber out of the water onto a rocky outcrop. They put on dry clothes. Voldemort stalks amongst dead bodies in Gringotts Bank. He speaks to his snake. The Malfoys stand nearby. Eyes wide with horror, Narcissa watches Voldemort and the snake. Griphook lies dead, still clutching the Sword of Gryffindor. It glows and slowly vanishes. Night in snowy Hogsmeade. Hermione, Ron, and Harry apparate nearby. The three friends run off. Death Eaters scour the village. Two Death Eaters search a covered market. They look under stalls and lift covers. The three fugitives crouch down, out of sight. Hearing the call, the two Death Eaters race from the market. The trio run up a set of narrow steps. They reach a locked, barred gate. Beckoned by a shadowy figure, Harry moves to a doorway and enters. The others follow him down a staircase. They enter a stone-walled room lit by a solitary oil lamp. Ron looks puzzled. Hermione and Ron see a painting on a wall. It's a moving portrait of a thin-faced girl with long, brown hair. Next to it, Hermione spots a mirror and sees Harry's face reflected back at her. The bottom corner of the mirror has a piece missing. She looks surprised. She turns to Harry, who inspects his own piece of mirror. It shows the back of Hermione's head. As Harry compares his shard with the missing section of the broken mirror, a bearded man comes in. He sets down food and drink. Harry glares at Aberforth. Aberforth stares at Harry, then addresses the portrait. The girl in the portrait nods, turns, and walks away into the painting, past trees and bushes. Hermione steps towards Harry, her eyes fixed on the painting.",
    "1277": "Hermione smiles. Ron races after the three students, as Harry starts to climb a mountain of furniture to reach the diadem. Hermione follows him. Harry finds a blue Pixie in the junk, and tosses it aside. More Pixies fly out of the mountain of furniture. Harry climbs frantically. Hermione is beside him. He sees the diadem wedged in the sofa, and wrenches it out. They clamber back down to the floor. They look down one of the aisles. The entrance to the aisle is glowing. A huge wave of flames surges towards them. It unites with a second wave, and pursues Harry, Ron, and Hermione. Harry knocks over furniture to slow it down. Harry looks back. The furniture is consumed by the raging inferno. The flames take the form of a fiery winged dragon. Goyle tries to extinguish the flames from the tip of his burning wand. Draco and Blaise back away from the fiery dragon. Goyle tosses his burning wand in to the fire. Hermione and Ron sprint ahead of the flames. In a different aisle, Harry is pursued by a flaming serpent. Terrified, Draco and his cronies begin scrambling up a high stack of furniture. Reunited, Harry, Hermione and Ron, see flames ahead of them. They turn. They are surrounded. Harry magics a protective shield. Ron falls back against some broomsticks and throws them to his friends. They sow upwards. Goyle climbs after Draco and Blaise. Dislodging a chair, Goyle falls backwards in to the raging inferno below. Draco and Blaise watch him fall. Ron turns to Harry. Losing their grip, Draco and Blaise fall. They cling to a carpet by their fingertips. Harry looks round. They swing their brooms round. Harry flies past, just missing Draco's outstretched hand. They try another pass. Harry grabs Draco and hauls him on to the broomstick. Ron grabs Blaise. Hermione leads the way, as they swerve to avoid tumbling, burning furniture. Hermione aims her wand at the flames up ahead. She clears a path. They make it out through the doors and fall off the broomsticks. Draco runs for it. Harry sees the diadem lying on the ground. Hermione tosses him a Basilisk's Fang. He sinks it in to the diadem. Black smoke rises from it. Ron kicks the diadem back in to the burning room. Three fiery images of Voldemort appear, surging towards them. As they back away, the doors slam shut. Gasping, Harry leans against a pillar. Nagini twists in to a coil. Voldemort falters. Harry shivers in the light. Voldemort turns in the dark, his face sweaty and taught. Harry grimaces. Voldemort faces his army. A group of Death Eaters steps forward, led by Pius Thicknesse. The spell kills Thicknesse.",
    "1278": "Stars drift slowly in the blackness of space. A moon glows silver in the darkness. Seen from the mountainous surface of the Earth. Letters form around the moon. A circle of reflected sunlight and the Earth form the two Os. In 1928, a blizzard lashes the Karakoram mountains in India. In a tent, a candle glows in a lantern and a cup of snow is placed on a gas burner. Climbing spikes are sharpened. Wind tears at the canvas walls of the tent. A light shines outside, then goes dark. A bearded climber looks puzzled. He emerges from the tent in thick furs with a climbing ax and a rope wrapped around him. He pulls on goggles to protect his eyes. Beams of light radiate skywards from behind a rocky ridge. The climber carefully ascends a snowy slope. The climber inches up a near vertical cliff. He plunges his ice ax into the rock and hauls himself up over the edge of the rock face. He stands slowly upright. He moves forward as the wind howls around him. He moves on, steadying himself with the ice ax. The climber raises his goggles, and stares at a glowing ball embedded in the snowy rock. Lights pulse inside the orb as he approaches. He closes on the object, which is about 10 feet high. Its surface is crystalline, with shadows and lights swirling inside. He reaches out a laser mutant hand on the orb. He slowly runs his hand over the surface, eyes narrowed above his snow crusted dark beard. He raises the eye axe. Light shines out as he breaks the crystalline crust. He squints at the intensity, the swirling brilliance within. He's enveloped in a brilliant light of overwhelming intensity. The eye sac lies on the snow. The climber lies next to it, his eyes closed. He awakens and rises slowly. He seats up and looks around. There is a spherical hole in the snowy rock face, but the orb is gone. The climber looks at this right hand. The mitten has a hole in it. He removes it, revealing a round coin-sized scar on the back of his hand. He frowns and checks his palm, too. He seats on the snow-covered rocky ground, and looks skywards through the swirling snow. Object seen through an electron microscope, appear on a screen. The tutor is slim, with dark hair tied in a pony tail. She smiles hesitantly. Cars stream across an arched iron bridge over a river. The tutor drives a small silver hatchback. A computer game character has a sword across his back. Jacob has got long dark curly hair. The tutor, his guardian, is white. Jacob is black. She crosses to the bed where he's concentrating on the game, and sits beside him.",
    "128": "The redcap goes up the steps into the car. Neff laboriously swings himself up onto the box and from there up on the steps, keeping his head down. Meantime, Phyllis is holding the attention of the conductor and porter by showing them the ticket. Phyllis nods and takes the ticket back. Neff has reached the top of the steps. She goes up after him and gives him the ticket. They are now close together. She kisses him. The redcap comes from inside the car. Redcap descends. Phyllis kisses Neff again quickly. She runs down the steps. The porter picks up the box. He and the conductor get on board the train. Phyllis stands there waving goodbye as the train starts moving, and the porter begins to close the car door. Phyllis turns and walks out of the shot in the direction of the parked car. Neff and the Porter. The conductor is going on into the car. Neff is half turned away from the porter. He holds the vestibule door open. Neff hobbles through. Most of the berths are made up. As Neff hobbles along, another porter and some passengers make way for the crippled man solicitously. Neff hobbles on through. Four or five passengers are reading or writing. Dark except for a little light coming from inside the parlor car. Neff has come out and hobbled to the railing. He stands looking back along the rails. Neff stands silent. He starts patting his pockets as if looking for something. Jackson takes out a small bag of tobacco and a packet of cigarette papers. He rises and exits into the parlor car. Neff turns slowly and watches Jackson go back through the car. Then he moves to one side of the platform and looks ahead along the track to orientate himself. He gives one last glance back into the parlor car to make sure no one is watching him. He slips the crutches from under his arms and stands on both feet. He drops the crutches off the train onto the tracks, then quickly swings his body over the rail. Neff is hanging onto the railing. He looks down, then lets go and drops to the right-of-way. THE CAMERA STOPS. The train recedes slowly into the night. Neff has fallen on the tracks. He picks himself up, rubs one knee and looks back along the line of the tracks and off to one side. Close beyond the edge of the right-of-way, the silhouette of a dump shows up. Beside it looms the dark bulk of the Dietrichson sedan. The headlights blink twice and go out. He starts running towards the car. He runs a little awkwardly because of the improvised cast on his left foot.",
    "1281": "She spots a razor and a shaving brush. He looks at her defiantly. She sighs and, carrying a washing basket, runs downstairs. Red and blue lights flash outside, as she crosses to the front door. A blonde woman in a blue top is standing among the group of police officers. Helen looks shocked. Motorcycle outriders prepare to escort the waiting car. A stern-faced woman with dark hair sits in the front seat. The blonde woman puts her arms protectively around the bemused Jacob. The convoy of two cars and four motorcycles pulls away. Lights flashing, they speed down rain-soaked streets. He points to the road ahead. Beyond the outliners their side of the highway is empty. She stares at the expressionless agent who stares straight ahead ignoring her. More vehicles join the convoy rolling down the empty night-time highway. Military vehicles and personnel maneuver as gates open to admit them. A Chinook helicopter stands outside a large hanger. The convoy pulls up at an aircraft. It's loaded rack down. The agent ushers the stunned Helen towards the helicopter. Inside, it's packed with soldiers and some civilians. Helen finds a space and sits down nervously. She looks across at a man with a dark, bushy beard. The twin rotor helicopter lifts off into the dark night sky. Floodlights illuminate a sports field teaming with equipment and personnel. The chopper lands mid-field. A soldier carries a heavy machine gun on his shoulder. As police cars escort more vehicles through the military throne. Soldiers push racks of protective clothing along a walkway. A NASA space agency logo adorns the screen in a large lecture theater. It's on a collision course with the Earth. Graphics show impact location Manhattan. Helen stares. The screen shows one hour 18 minutes 43 seconds. The time is counting down. She tentatively opens the toilet cubicle door. She looks nervously at the woman in military uniform and nods. Choppers hurddle towards the bright lights of Manhattan. Helen looks shocked and stares out of the window of the chopper at the city lights. Helen and Yusef hold hands as the scientists brace themselves. Helen opens her eyes. A bright ball of light is moving through the dark sky above the illuminated city. It passes behind the towering Empire State building. It illuminates the bell gothic fasade of Saint Patrick's Cathedral and moves with swirling brilliance towards Central Park. Trees cast eerie shadows across the grass. As people gather and stare up in horror. As Helen stares out of the chopper window as the object sinks towards the ground. Powerful blasts of energy slows decent, generating clouds of billowing vapor. The watching crowds are silhouetting in its intense light. The draft from the object's descent causes a tsunami of wind and vapor.",
    "1285": "Klaatu walks up to a snack machine. Watched by a child, he studies the mechanism, then places his hand on the selection panel. A tuna salad sandwich drops into the collection tray. The little curly-haired lad walks up and stares at Klaatu, who senses the presence, turns and stares back. He stands as the boy continues to stare before being ushered away by his mother. Klaatu watches the ticket fight and takes a bite of the sandwich. The heavy-set man notices and follows him. The big man collapses. The thief sees his chance and snatches the ticket back off the prone man. A security guard chases the thief as his colleague attends the fallen man. Klaatu watches. Klaatu walks into the grubby men's room. Standing in front of the mirror, he pulls back his jacket. There's a patch of blood on his chest seeping through his shirt. He touches the blood, studies his reflection, then touches a finger to the sweat on his brow. He collapses. With a reprimanding look, she takes the phone. The family next door unloading their car. Crowds mob the offices of the New Jersey Transport Police. Helen pushes her way through the throng. She moves through the crowd and is concerned to see Klaatu sitting on a bench, his head slumped forward. As she approaches, he looks up into her eyes. Evacuees file through the city past fences topped with barbed wire. In the pouring rain, she opens the passenger door of her car and he gets in. Jacob's sitting in the back. Klaatu turns and looks at the boy. She shoots him a mistrustful look and maneuvers her silver car out into the busy street. She pulls out the sample of his fatty birth skin. Dips his finger in and rubs some of the substance on the stitched bullet wound on his chest. The wound heals immediately. Helen stares in disbelief. She gapes at him, open-mouthed. Jacob looks puzzled. Klaatu calmly adjusts his tie. Lost for words, she obeys. Two heavily-armed fighter drones hurtle through the clouds towards Manhattan. The drones are remote-piloted from the base. They skim between the high-rise city blocks. Pilot's eye view is displayed on a bank of monitors. The orange light glows in the huge robot's head as the Reapers approach. Beams of energy shoot out from the robot's eye slit, detonating the missiles. Beams from the robot are locked on the Reapers. The Reapers are sent plunging into two tanks. The robot's light goes out. The Colonel rips off his headset in frustration. Traffic clogs the night time highway. As she pulls into a rain-drenched parking lot, an illuminated golden arches sign is reflected in the car's windscreen.",
    "1287": "A sphere rises over the Great Wall of China, another over the Pyramids. From all over the world, glowing spheres head into space, away from earth's atmosphere. Klaatu walks in slow-motion through the woods, a shadow emerging through the mist. Glaring at him, Jacob reluctantly obeys. They are caught in the police car's spotlight as she backs away from him in horror. Klaatu's face appears on the cop's computer. The officer drives up to them. The cop looks shocked. With a touch, he sends Helen's car crashing into the cop, crushing him against his own cruiser. Klaatu then releases Helen's car. The cop slumps dead to the ground. Klaatu scoops some of the fatty flesh from the sample jar. He touches a hand to the police cruiser, activating all its systems. Helen and Jacob stare as he then reaches down with his other hand and touches the alien flesh to the officer's head. Power surges through the man's body. The officer rolls over. He's alive. They stare at one another. Klaatu looks around, hearing the sirens. Mike's with the Defense Secretary. The robot is floating down a deep, concrete-walled shaft. The light in its head slit comes on. Helen's car is parked in the rain. A grandfather clock shows 5 past 11. Helen leads the way into the house. She leads the way into a study. Klaatu walks into the next room which has books piled everywhere, and approaches a chalkboard covered in figures. He erases a highly complex formula. Helen turns away looking worried and approaches Jacob. She strokes the boy's hair affectionately. Klaatu writes his own formula on the chalkboard. A gray-haired man watches as he works, then approaches him. He picks up a piece of chalk and also starts to write. Klaatu glances at Karl's work then moves to another part of the board. Karl pauses to look at his figures as Helen watches them both curiously. Klaatu draws a sweeping arrow across the board, connecting the formulae. Karl continues to write as Klaatu adjusts some of his equations. Klaatu studies him, then turns away from the chalkboard. Walks across the room, and looks up at the speaker which the music is playing through. Lights shine in the dark at Mount Weather Flash Facility, Bluemont, Virginia. The suited agent steps into the operations room separated from a circular chamber by thick windows. The windows look out onto the vast head and shoulders of GORT. The light in his head is glowing orange and tracks the agent's every move. The agent stares at GORT and walks slowly forwards. GORT's glowing eye follows him. The agent backs nervously away from the window. Klaatu studies him thoughtfully. He walks out of the room through the French windows out onto a terrace.",
    "1289": "FLASHBACK - Juno approaches a boy hidden by shadow. He's sitting in an overstuffed chair. She slowly, clumsily lowers herself onto his lap. A DOG barks, jarring Juno back to reality. We see a teacup poodle tethered in the yard a few feet away from the abandoned living room set. The dog yaps again. She swigs from an absurdly oversized carton of juice and wipes her mouth with the back of her hand. Finally, a panting Juno arrives at DANCING ELK DRUG on the main drag of her small Minnesota suburb, Dancing Elk. She enters the DRUGSTORE. ROLLO, the eccentric drugstore clerk, sneers at Juno from behind the counter. He wears a polyester uniform vest. Rollo regards her with intense skepticism. An eavesdropping TOUGH GIRL wearing an oversized jacket and lots of makeup gapes at Juno from the beauty aisle. Rollo pulls the bathroom key out of reach. Rollo sighs and slips her the bathroom key. Juno races down one of the aisles. She shakes the stick desperately in an attempt to skew the results. Shake. Shake. Juno walks slowly and dejectedly up the street to her house, gnawing on the Super Rope. Juno trudges toward her HOUSE. The yard is a wild tangle of prairie grass and wild flowers. She stops and loops the Super Rope over a low-hanging tree branch, contemplating how to fashion a noose. Juno's BEDROOM is decorated with punk posters: The Damned, The Germs, the Stooges, Television, Richard Hell, etc. She picks up a hamburger-shaped phone to call her best friend. LEAH's room is cluttered with the sentimental junk that certain girls love to hoard. Leah and Juno struggle to drag a recliner across a well manicured suburban lawn. They make a formidable team. Bleeker discreetly pushes a POSTCARD to Juno with his foot. She picks it up off the floor, reads it, then looks at Bleeker, who is watching the teacher obediently. Bleeker putting on double socks in his Car-Bed. Bleeker putting on his sweat bands. CU of Bleeker applying Runner's Glide. CU of a CROISSANT POCKET warming in the microwave. PAUL BLEEKER steps onto the front porch of his house for early morning track practice. Bleeker is startled to discover that Juno is outside waiting for him. She has somehow arranged the living room set on the front lawn, and is seated in the armchair, chewing a pipe officiously. She mounts her bicycle and waves before riding off. Juno pushes her crappy bike into the bike rack and winds a lock around it. We see Steve looking back at Juno for a brief second with mixed feelings. We see Leah at the far end of the hallway, talking animatedly with a paunchy middle-aged teacher, KEITH.",
    "1294": "Inside, we see Vanessa sitting alone at her perfect dining room table, drinking a glass of wine. Vanessa takes a sip and continues to let the days events sink in. After a beat, Mark comes down the stairs to join her. Mark nods and sits down. There's a LOUD KNOCK on the front door. Mark opens the door. He squints and sees Juno pulling away in the van. He holds it up. We can see there's WRITING on the back. It looks like it was handwritten on the back of a Jiffy Lube bill. Vanessa takes the note from his hand and turns it over, examining it. A porch light's been left on for her, and the place looks cozy and inviting. Juno parks her car and walks up to her house. She picks a CROCUS from the unkempt garden near the porch and sniffs it. She lifts her shirt and tickles her belly with it. Mac is alone at the kitchen table going over the family finances while drinking one of Bren's weight loss shakes. Juno enters. A wave of REALIZATION crosses Juno's face. Juno presses Bleeker's hand against her belly. Juno lets out a genuine shriek of pain. The doctor reveals JUNO'S BABY BOY above the sheet. Juno looks at the baby in awe, then her eyes begin to flutter and she passes out. Paulie Bleeker is running as fast as his legs can carry him on the Dancing Elk track. There's a very sparse crowd in the bleachers. As Paulie approaches the tape, his envious teammate Vijay looks on. The fifteen or so people in attendance cheer. Paulie breaks the tape, winning the race. Bleeker looks out at the BLEACHERS, scanning them for Juno. Bleek takes off RUNNING toward the parking lot without stopping to explain. The nurse turns and addresses an unseen spectator. A NURSE reaches into one of the maternity ward bassinets and gently lifts up a swaddled newborn baby. We move to the door and get a view of Vanessa's bedroom. We see her lying in bed with a burp cloth draped over her shoulder, feeding the baby. For the first time ever, Vanessa looks disorganized, unshowered -- and incredibly happy. There are formula bottles on the bedside table and a bassinet pushed close to the bed. Obviously, she hasn't been away from the baby for a single moment. It's a sparkling summer afternoon. She waves goodbye to Bren, who is playing in the yard with two WEIMARANERS. She looks happy, but older. She looks almost as happy with her dogs as VANESSA looked with her baby. Juno wheels her bicycle out of the detached garage. She's obviously not pregnant anymore. Her guitar is slung over her shoulder in a gig bag.",
    "1296": "Morgan is petting Houdini's fur gently. As Graham and Officer Paski get closer, they see Morgan is crying. Then they see the dog is laying on its side and has a BARBECUE. Bo is on top of the jungle gym curled up in a ball. They stare at Morgan as he slowly pulls an inhaler from his pocket and brings it to his mouth. He inhales the asthma spray. He lowers the inhaler so he can speak. Graham stares at his ten-year-old son. He starts crying. Graham picks him up in his arms. Graham reaches up for Bo. She has dirt and tears on her face. She slowly climbs down. Graham carries Bo as she cries in his arms. He starts towards the house. Merrill walks out from the back holding a bowl of food. Merrill stands still with potato salad in his hands. Graham reaches the porch of his house and opens the screen door. The children watch over their father's shoulder as Merrill runs to their other German Shepherd sitting quietly near the house and leads her by her collar across the yard to the shed. Officer Paski is pulling the barbecue fork out of their dead dog's neck. Graham lies in bed. He rests his cheek against the pillow as he lies by himself. Graham slowly gets up from the bed. He takes his daughter's hand and starts out of the room. They both sit quietly for a moment. He looks to his daughter with startled eyes. Graham's eyes drift to the bedroom window. A LARGE SILHOUETTED. Graham stands. Merrill opens the front door. It's pitch black outside. Merrill turns to Graham and gestures with his fingers. Merrill brings his fingers together at the end of a gesture. Merrill and Graham look out into the darkness. Graham runs through the darkness around the first corner of the house. Merrill waves his arms. Merrill turns a corner full speed. THE LARGE FIGURE HAS COME. Merrill's eyes drift above them. Graham starts out of the kitchen. Bo watches cartoons. Bo's cartoon is replaced by a special report news icon. Morgan takes the asthma inhaler from his pocket and breathes in deeply. Graham and Edgar walk down the driveway to Edgar's patrol car. Graham TURNS IT OFF. Morgan nods and then plops back into the backseat. Downtown Bucks County. A group of small stores along a quiet street. The Hess station wagon pulls in front of a free parking meter. Graham steps out the driver's side and looks around. Merrill puts change in the meter. Morgan walks up to Graham with Bo. Morgan holds out his hand. Morgan takes the money Graham gives him, then takes Bo's hand and walks down the sidewalk.",
    "1297": "Graham watches them turn into a store. Merrill steps onto the sidewalk. Hands in his pockets as he walks away. Graham turns and calls after him. Merrill waves over his shoulder. He keeps walking. Graham starts across the street to the pharmacy. Three isles wide. MR AND MRS. NATHAN, a couple in their early seventies, sit behind their counter and watch a black and white TV. Morgan steps up to the counter. Morgan shrugs. Mrs. Nathan pushes her husband aside. Mrs. Nathan points over to the far corner. A gum chewing PHARMACIST in her early twenties, who looks like she's in her teens, glances through back shelves of medicines as she listens to the radio. Graham stares at the girl. When Tracey speaks her VOICE IS A BIT SHAKY. Graham looks at the young girl's teary eyes. Merrill stares up at a poster with a muscular guy in an Army uniform standing at attention on a beach. We are in a narrow ARMY RECRUITING CENTER. Inside the small storefront space is a desk. The crewcut guy savors the beat of silence. It takes a second, but Merrill smiles. The crewcut guy smiles back. The crewcut guy reaches to a stack of brochures. Picks the top brochure and hands it to Merrill. Merrill looks up from the brochure. The crewcut guy begins to stare at Merrill closely. Merrill turns to the young man, about his age, who sits at the folding table. LIONEL smirks. Merrill tucks the pamphlet in his jacket. Looks like he's not going to say anything. When he does, the words are soft and worn; they've been said a hundred times. Merrill turns and starts walking. As he passes Lionel, Merrill makes a small, quick move in Lionel's direction, like he might hit him. Lionel flinches and covers his face. Merrill walks out the door of the army recruiting office. Graham glances at the girl as she sits sideways to him at the counter. Graham's eyes widen. Morgan turns a knob on the side. Morgan hands Graham the monitor in the front seat. Everyone becomes frozen, standing next to the station wagon. Three of the doors are open. He keeps it out in the air where he had it as he closed his door. Graham looks to Merrill over the roof of the station wagon. Graham moves. He hands the monitor over the hood. Merrill reaches for it. Graham looks at Merrill, who's now one of them. Morgan is the first one to move. He moves from the back passenger door to the back bumper where he begins to climb onto the station wagon. Morgan crawls on the roof and takes the monitor ever-so gently out of Graham and Merrill's outstretched hands.",
    "1298": "Bo runs to the front bumper and climbs onto the hood. Merrill climbs up over the side and joins Morgan on the roof. Merrill keeps a hand on his nephew. Morgan raises the monitor above his head. THERE'S MOVEMENT RIGHT NEXT TO HIM. Graham spins and aims the FLASHLIGHT AT THE CROPS TO HIS RIGHT. THE LIGHT ONLY PENETRATES A FEW FEET INTO THE CROPS. Graham holds his breath. Graham turns and drops the FLASHLIGHT at the same time. THE BEAM OF LIGHT TURNS OFF WHEN THE FLASHLIGHT HITS THE GROUND. Graham kneels down and gropes in the darkness. His hands search over the ground in all directions. They finally touch the flashlight. Graham tries to get up. He stumbles backwards into the crops. He's tangled in crops as he struggles to rise. He gets up and starts running. Leaves and stalks slap him from all directions. THERE IS SOMETHING COMING BEHIND. Graham makes a sudden right turn. He puts his hands in front of him to protect his face and eyes. Another sudden turn, this time left. Graham keeps running across the yard. Graham steps into the kitchen. His hair is messed. His shirt has a few leaves from corn stalks stuck to it. The children don't notice his presence. Graham takes two steps to the kitchen table and slowly takes a seat. They're splashing each other at the sink as they clean the dinner dishes. His kind eyes stare down at the ground as he slows his mind. His breathing is a slow controlled pant. The children stop playing and look up to Graham. They follow his stare to the kitchen table. Graham looks up at them. Morgan reaches into the pile of video tapes under the television stand. He grabs one. Bo snatches the video as Morgan tries to put it into the VCR. Morgan stares at his sister. Graham and Merrill sit down at the same time on the sofa. They both have the same dazed, slow movements. Morgan rummages through the pile of videos frantically. He finds one and reaches for the VCR. He's breathing heavy now, Wheezing actually. Morgan moves to the sofa and takes a seat in between his father and his uncle. Bo walks over and squeezes in also. The four of them stare at the television. Morgan brings his asthma spray to his mouth and inhales. The family room lights are off now. There are a couple glasses of Bo's water on the television now. Bo is asleep on Graham's shoulder. Morgan is asleep on Merill's lap. Graham turns his sleepy eyes away from the screen to Merrill. Merrill looks his brother in the eyes. Merrill looks at the TV screen.",
    "1309": "He sits as thoughts crash at his head. He finally reaches for the keys and starts up the car. He looks into the rearview mirror and sees the man in the GREEN ARMY JACKET pass behind his car. Elijah quickly turns and sees the man moving through the parked cars heading out of the parking lot. Elijah takes a deep breath and turns off the engine. The figure in the army jacket seems to move farther away with every step. Elijah starts breathing harder. He pushes himself to move faster. He avoids the hard chrome bumpers and tailpipes that jut out from the cars as he quickens his pace through the lot. He gains on the army jacket. The man in the army jacket turns as he reaches a subway entrance that marks the end of the parking lot. He disappears into the subway entrance. Elijah quickens into a jog now. He hasn't done this in a while and it's painful. He makes it with great strain to the subway. He looks into the entrance. A steep flight of stairs leads to the subway floor. The tail of the army jacket is glimpsed before it disappears. Elijah breathes hard as he takes hold of the railing. Elijah starts his descent. Elijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility. and then his foot catches on a step. His hand slips away from the railing. He falls down the remaining part of the stairs. He comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a. His contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. The last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out from the belt of his pants. David's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes. David turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game. Joseph runs out from the huddle across the field to David. Joseph nods. David looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who stands with the other children. David stares at his son. David watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep.",
    "1313": "Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. David's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the information booth. He watches him for a beat. David watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself. Then David steps back to look around. He bumps the shoulder of a man standing behind him. David takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. The enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it. The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him. The man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening. It opens slowly anyway. David stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable. David is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man. He's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive. He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM. The man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it. Four identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his bin inside. David waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. And then they open. The huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit. David lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. The man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. The orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves. He turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. David stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it.",
    "1318": "It is early morning and the parking lot is empty except for Marcus' van. The Mercedes eventually pulls in, parking beside him. Marcus throws open the back of the van, revealing the components of the water drill in various prop gift boxes. Willie wears a forbearing smile. He shakes his head and chuckles as Marcus tosses him an empty red Santa sack. Marcus stares. Jesse, the security guard unlocks the door and opens up for Willie and Marcus. They enter in costume. Willie lugs the filled sack and seems to be straining. As Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags. Willie drops the bag with a loud thud. Willie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling. He gets up and walks away. Gin sits at his desk sucking in a Pall Mall filterless. Bob Chipeska sits opposite. A bus clears frame, revealing the kid as he walks toward the mall. Cheering, the six bullies engulf the kid. Marcus and Willie go about the business of being a Santa-Elf team. Willie sees off another child. Willie stares at him. Marcus returns to the velvet rope to find Gin Slagel waiting stone-faced. Marcus sighs. Gin leaves. Willie's eyes do not leave the spot in space. The Kid turns to go. Willie beckons him. He displays an envelope. The Kid's eye is indeed black and blue. He reaches self-consciously up to it. Willie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait. Marcus stares at him. Lois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs. She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs. Lois is in the driver's seat. Gin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down. SCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van. He shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises the hood. The two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood. Marcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals. Willie follows. Willie enters. He goes up and tries to yank the hand, which the hysterical Kid yanks away. As Willie drags him to the sink and runs water over the cut, the Kid takes great gulping breaths and finally manages to say. Willie grabs a vodka bottle standing open on the counter and liberally pours some on the hand. The Kid shrieks.",
    "1323": "Bob pulls his son close and hugs him with all his might, tears filling his eyes. Charlie tried hard to push and there it is a BABY'S CRIES. Audrey stood stunned, standing wide eyes opened and, holding up the CHILD. Audrey reacts, crosses to the counter, turns on the radio, trying to drown out the sound of the approaching menace. Out of the STATIC, the haunting sounds of BING CROSBY singing SILENT NIGHT fills the room. The quiet before the storm. Michael helps Charlie quickly clean herself up. She stares at him, a burning spite in her eyes. Those words provide her little comfort. Charlie shakes her head, this is all too much. Michael nods grimly. Charlie looks urgently at Michael. The baby CRIES LOUDER. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey. Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie. Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. Michael cocks his gun. Points it at Sandra. Charlie squares off with Sandra, panic in her eyes. Charlie stares at her in horror, the truth of those words rattling her to the very core. A brilliant SPECTRAL LIGHT pours into the diner. She raises a hand to block the light. And that's when Michael fires. BLAM! Sandra staggers back, blood dripping from the hole in her forehead, and. Michael fires again. Blowing Sandra's body back through the doorway. Jeep watches the baby sail SLOWLY through the air. Jeep DIVES for the baby, catching the bundle of rags mere inches from the ground! And then he looks up to see. The dark SILHOUETTE OF A MAN approaching from out of the spectral light. A MAN WITH WINGS. Jeep's eyes grow wide as the FIERCE ANGEL steps into the diner. The angel's wings retract with clockwork-like precision. And now that we see his face clearly, we notice his striking resemblance to Michael. Gabriel raises a massive, ferocious, strangely mechanical looking MACE in his powerful hands. And the world returns to NORMAL SPEED as Gabriel brings the mace arcing down at Jeep. Jeep rolls! CLANG! The weapon just misses him, hitting the floor in a spray of sparks, literally CRACKING THE GROUND. Gabriel brings the mace up again. With a sweep of his hand, Gabriel sends Bob flying across the diner where he crashes down behind the counter near the stove. Michael GRABS JEEP'S HAND before the boy can rush back into the fray. Michael lets go of Jeep's hand and turns away to face Gabriel, leaving Jeep to contemplate those final words. And that's when Jeep opens his hand to find the KEYS to Michael's Police Cruiser. Jeep looks up from the keys to see Charlie, Audrey and the baby.",
    "1324": "Michael slowly approaches Gabriel. Jeep gives it some gas, but the engine's not catching. A dark shape pounces onto the hood of the car. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a shopping mall Santa Claus, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head. Michael closes his eyes. Buzzing surrounds them. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward the source of the clicking. He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. It takes the creature a moment to realize that the clicking sound is coming from Bob's silver Zippo. Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter. Bob looks at Gabriel. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty Zippo. Gabriel's eyes go wide as the tiny flame dances in front of the stove's broken gas line. Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes. The massive explosion rocks the slow moving vehicle. Jeep swings the gun around. BLAM! Gabriel takes one in the shoulder, but it doesn't slow him down. Audrey desperately tries to load a flare while avoiding Gabriel's grasp. Jeep can't get off another shot without the risk of hitting Audrey. Gabriel is almost entirely in the car now. Audrey swings the flare gun toward Gabriel, but he knocks her hand aside just as she pulls the trigger and the flare goes off inside the car! Jeep ducks. The car swerves madly. The flare ricochets through the cabin, lighting it up like the Fourth of July! Gabriel lunges for Charlie just as the flare bounces off the windshield - PING! - and nails him right in the face, setting. And that gives Jeep the chance to swing around and fire. He holds onto the car with an iron grip. Starts to pull himself back in. Jeep pulls the trigger again and click. Brings it up to fire, but he's too fast! WHACK! Gabriel knocks her into the side of the car with a sweep of his hand. Now he's clawing his way unobstructed toward Charlie again. Charlie pushes herself and the baby down on the floor in front of the passenger seat. Jeep punches it. The speedometer leaps ahead. Gabriel lunges over the passenger seat, grasping for Charlie, his ferocious hand only inches from her and the baby, when. Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and roll into a ball of fire. The Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation.",
    "1325": "Michael slowly turns around. Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, fingers tightening. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. The street lamps begin to flicker and strobe, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his whole body quaking, heels clicking the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. His eyes snap open, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Estevez looks at his partner with confusion. Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to. Blam! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already firing back. Bullets rip up the concrete. Smash! The squad car window shatters, Burton's chest exploding! And down he goes, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rising from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and floors it, roaring away, as the flickering street lamps finally go out in rapid succession, a wave chasing him, plunging the entire city into darkness. Bolts awake. Breathing hard. Covered with sweat. Jeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. He's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight. A couple of ancient Silverstream trailers are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors creaks open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness. A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign. Jeep turns to see Charlie, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. She approaches Jeep. Sees the strain in his eyes. He struggles for a moment, nods. A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face. Jeep turns away, dejected. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at. Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside. Bob Hansen, late 40's, owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out of it.",
    "1328": "Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter. Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE. The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. Jeep snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face him. Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE. Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands. Gladys rockets straight at him! But Jeep's too afraid to move. He clamps his eyes shut, bracing himself for the end. A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes. His gun's still cocked. Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. Sandra is on the floor with her husband. Blood pours freely from his neck. Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation -- then he rushes to help. Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck. A few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL. They're black. Undulating. Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield. And that's when they realize it hose aren't clouds. The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED bug guts. Bob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like he's about to puke or faint. Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling. He can't get the words out. Bob rests a hand on his boy's shoulder. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front. Bob and Jeep appear from the back, as Kyle, Percy, Audrey and Sandra carry Howard into the diner, all of them stumbling, gasping for air. Charlie moves in to help. Percy races for the back. Bob, Kyle and Jeep quickly drag Gladys's body wrapped in the plastic table cloth a short ways from the diner. They warily eye the curtain of FLIES no more than a hundred yards out.",
    "1333": "The storm is passing now, blown by the driving wind. The camera rises up to find Javert, the officer in charge of the convict workforce, looking on, his face rain-lashed and expressionless. Behind Javert, through the storm rain we glimpse a forest of half-built ships, their ribbed frames like great skeletons in the mist. Foreground convicts are at work on another ship that is almost completed, labouring in the crashing spray. With a last great heave the lines of convicts haul the damaged ship onto the slipway. He stands above the men on the top of the dock, as lines of convicts labour beneath him on the steep steps of the dock wall. Javert nods to the guards, and they begin to form the chained men into lines to return to their prison. Javert approaches Jean Valjean. Javert sees and points his stick at Valjean in silent command. Valjean stares back for a beat, defying him. Then he drops down into the seething water and re-emerges with the great mast in his hands, held over his head. His head breaks water with his bitter gaze still on Javert, as he throws the mast ashore in a deliberate display of strength. Valjean walks away, hardly able to take in that he is free at last. Valjean makes his way up a rising track, a worn knapsack on his back. Valjean strides down the long rising road, pulling his thin coat close round him against the cold winter wind. He comes to a stop at the top of the hill, and there before him, lit by the rising sun, spreads a wide vista of fields and towns and villages, stretching into the distance, with the snow capped Alps beyond. He passes a long line of labourers working. He approaches the overseer. Behind and below him lies Toulon at the sea's edge. The overseer notices shaved hair showing under his cap. Bewildered, fearful, suspicious, Valjean gets up and goes with the Bishop into the house by the church. A simple table on which is laid out bread and wine, with silver cutlery. The bishop's sister Madame Baptistine stands. Two silver candlesticks light the room, illuminating walls painted with religious scenes. Valjean hesitates. The Bishop looks from the silver to Valjean. The old Bishop is holding out the two silver candlesticks. Valjean, utterly bewildered, takes the silver candlesticks. Amazed, Valjean looks up. Silenced by the Bishop's gentle tones, the policemen turn and leave. He takes out his yellow passport and stares at it. Valjean kneels in the church. Slowly, he examines the yellow passport and raises it high, as if to the altar. Valjean stands and turns, walking fast to the door of the church.",
    "1335": "Bullets fly, and every few moments another cannon ball smashes into the piled debris. The big gun has been lined up with the gate and has burst right through in the first hit. Enjolras and the students throw themselves onto the barricades, firing at the attackers, handing their rifles down to others to be re-loaded, firing again. The hard core of student fighters retreat, firing as they go, into the Caf Musain. Marius takes a bullet, and crumples and falls. Valjean runs towards him - CRASH! The latest cannonade bursts a hole in the barricade and now the soldiers are storming through. Students driving back the pursuing soldiers hack away at the staircase, smashing it to fragments - the soldiers below fire up at them - students fall, their bodies caught on the jagged remnants of the stairs. Students and soldiers fight in the caf , on the stairs, up the stairs to the upper room. The students' ammunition has run out, they're hurling sticks and bottles - but the soldiers have found a way to clamber up, shooting as they come, and one by one the students are falling. Valjean has Marius in his arms and is hiding him from the onrush of the soldiers. Valjean carries Marius away from the carnage. The soldiers break through at last to the upper room, to find there's only Enjolras still alive. He stands by the window, knowing he will die now, proud and unafraid. Seeing him the soldiers hesitate. Javert draws his pistol and holds it to Valjean's head. Valjean meets his eyes. He moves up from the embankment onto the bridge. He begins to move away along the embankment, up steps, towards a bridge. He's unaware of everything except the turmoil in his brain. He climbs up onto the parapet, reaching his arms up to the night sky. Here he stands, looking down at the dark water of the night river. The Seine forms a whirlpool here, where violent currents swirl round the piles of the bridge. He reaches higher, turning his body, twisting, as if he wants some angel from on high to save him - and so, turning, he falls into the river. The swirling eddies close over him. And he's lost. Women move about the street, seeking their dead loved ones among the bodies that still litter the barricade. These are both the middle-class mothers of the students - Enjolras's mother, Grantaire's sister - and the working women of the slums for whom they died, united now in their grief. Slowly he rises from the chair and turns to the doorway. There stands Cosette, waiting for him. Cosette holds Marius, supporting him, as he enters the house.",
    "1340": "Valjean and Cosette turn into a street that is walled in by high windowless houses. Then he sees a nearby lamp bracket. The narrow street turns, and opens out onto the river. They follow it round a corner to find - a dead end. Valjean stops. A high wall before them. They're trapped. Valjean looks round. Once on the top, he hauls Cosette up by the rope. A cloister. As he sings he walks out onto the roof and stands by the symbol of the HQ, a monumental stone eagle. He looks down at the lights reflected in the river below. Then up at the great city. The fine ladies and grand gentlemen in the carriages avert their eyes, or raise the blinds of their carriage windows to shut out the sight of the losers of their world. Gavroche, bounding over their heads, evading the swipes of liveried footmen, lands on the running board of one particularly grand carriage and begs/taunts the RICH. STILL RUNNING WITH Gavroche as he hops onto the back of another very grand carriage, the traffic now moving at last, hitching a ride on the back - one or two of his gang hop on back of carriage with him, the others run panting after to hear his political lecture. The carriage has reached an arch into a courtyard where a crowd of a couple of hundred is gathered outside a house of sickness. The carriage stops as its occupant wants to watch what is going on. Gavroche jumps off as the carriage stops and joins the crowd. The crowd is made up of citizens of Paris, student revolutionaries, the poor and beggars. The students hand out printed leaflets and try to excite the crowd. A student, ENJOLRAS, stands on a raised step, making an impassioned speech with fellow student MARIUS. A priest is seen hurrying into the house, accompanied by two altar boys. In the crowd a young street girl, EPONINE, has her eyes fixed longingly on the handsome Marius. The occupant of the stopped carriage is MONSIEUR GILLENORMAND, Marius' Grandfather. He is clearly deeply unhappy to see his grandson engaged in such an activity. Mounted Police ride in to break up the crowd. Marius turns to see his Grandfather staring him down, furious. Gillenormand turns to get back in his carriage. Through a crack in a door, we see Marius sitting on a tatty mattress in a tiny hovel of a room. He is taking out a hunting rifle from under the mattress, wrapped in a rag. His eye is caught by the ring on his finger. CLOSE ON a signet ring, a family crest. Marius stares at the ring then takes it off his finger.",
    "1342": "Marius rushes down the street, Eponine following. At the far end is the walled garden behind which lies Valjean's house. Cosette sees Marius. She comes up the garden path towards him. Cosette holds the wrought-ironwork of the gate with both hands, eyes on Marius. Marius wraps his hands round Cosette's. Eponine looks on and suffers. Valjean comes to the door. He goes to the gate and opens it. Eponine screams. Valjean, now in his own bedroom, hears the scream and turns to the window. Thenardier and his gang shrink into the shadows, as Eponine's scream ends at last. He comes back to Cosette. Valjean comes running into Cosette's room. Valjean takes her in his arms. Valjean leaves to start packing. Feverishly, Cosette scribbles a letter. Cosette hurries down the garden to the gate, and goes to put the folded letter in the grill where her and Marius' hands entwined. Eponine steps forward. She opens the letter, reads it, then hides it in her pocket. Eponine stands outside Marius' door. Marius looks up. Marius by the empty house. INTERCUT between Eponine at the gate, Cosette and Valjean in the carriage, and Marius in the dark garden. Grantaire is downstairs flirting with a BARMAID. MADAME HUCHELOUP the proprietress of the Cafe Musain is sewing a red revolutionary flag to help the students. Javert is briefing a hundred uniformed police about the coming day in a grand ornate old room at Police Headquarters. Monsieur and Madame Thenardier are in the ground-floor bar, slyly watching a student smuggling some rifles up the stairs disguised in a piece of cloth. Grantaire rather reluctantly goes upstairs. Enjolras and the students have a production line under way for making bullets. Marius enters the ground floor and takes the red flag from Madame Hucheloup that she has just finished. Joly takes a tray and collects empty tankards. As he ascends the stairs, Madame Hucheloup tries to get him to give the tankards back. Joly starts to melt the tankards in a pot to make more bullets. Marius enters the first floor to join them at last. Valjean and Cosette arrive at their new hideout - Marius ties the red flag onto a flagpole -. Javert in the police station to his men -. We pull back from Enjolras and Marius holding their flag at the first floor window with the students beyond them to see that citizens have spilled out of the Cafe Musain into the street and have all joined in the final chorus. Now into view come the leaders of a great FUNERAL PROCESSION. An entire battalion of infantry, marching with weapons reversed. A division of Cavalry rides in front, behind a section of military drummers who drum a military tatoo.",
    "1348": "The boys are scared as they watch the creature hold Woodward tight, lift him, and its tentacles suddenly thrust into his nose, ears, and mouth. Joe stands and looks intently at the screen. Just then a muffled shatter-crash. Suddenly boom! The doors burst open and armed commandos. Donny gets stoned in his car. Doesn't notice the movement in the distance behind him. The military coming in. The locker hallway: the boys are handcuffed and scared, being led out by armed soldiers. Nelec moves to them. Overmyer checks their pockets as Nelec takes Cary's backpack, opens it, and pulls out some fireworks. Joe's terrified as Overmyer pulls from Joe's pocket a couple coins, half a pack of Bubble Yum and his mother's necklace. Drops everything but the necklace. Joe reacts, panicked. Joe's on the verge of tears as Overmyer pockets the necklace. Off the terrified boys as they're ushered away. The boys are put onto the bus. Boom down to Donny's car in the foreground, where we realize that we haven't been the only audience to this: Donny, sunk deep in his seat, hiding, watches wide-eyed as the bus drives away. His stoned mind races. Staying hidden from the remaining military, Donny scrambles for his CB, turns to channel 9, grabs the mike, speaks quietly, frantic. Jack moves fast through the crowded evac area. Preston reads Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine. Suddenly Jack is there, grabs him and pulls him up. Pan as Nelec moves back. We push in on Overmyer, who sits near the front, putting on his dark gloves. Nelec sits, which takes us to a shot towards the back of the bus. Another airman, Hernandez, 40, sits too. Push past them toward our four boys, sitting cuffed and seat-belted behind the dirty, wired safety glass, all looking toward us, terrified. Glass! The entire bus is rocked, Charles screams, hurt. At the front of the bus, Nelec falls, hits a bench, then. The bus was hit so hard it rides for a moment only on its. The military driver struggles with the wheel. The bus slams back onto the road, loud. A tire blows! We. The kids panic as the hobbled bus still drives. Push in on Cary, to closeup, looking past camera, terrified. Charles scrambles to unlatch his seatbelt. Baaam!!! The bus is slammed so hard. Windows shatter. Charles and Cary, seatbelts removed, land on Joe and Martin. The three soldiers hit the window-floor painfully. Hernandez so hard he's instantly. Nelec rises. Scared, but pissed. The rear wheels of the bus scream in rotation. We countermove with the creature as it comes around the other side, climbs onto the exposed side, metal and window.",
    "1358": "Izzy opens another car hood and finds pieces missing. As Jack heads back to his car, three residents move to him, walk with him, and ad lib. He stops, noticing four military trucks driving past slowly, with antennas atop the trucks, and the men inside seemingly scanning the area. Jack is disturbed by this. Joe rides along a hillside, parks his bike, and walks toward the edge. Joe moves into the doorway where his dad and others convene. Joe has heard this and dropped his flashlight, causing the men to all turn, silent. Joe, on the spot. Joe paints his model on the floor of his living room, watching In Search Of and talking to Charles on his walkie talkie. In the middle of nowhere wooded area, an Ohio Power cherry picker truck drives up and parks beside a utility pole. Rooney, 49, with a cigarette in his mouth, makes notes on a weathered clipboard. He glances at the power line, doesn't understand what he sees, and the camera pushes in on him. He radios in. A loud town meeting occurs with two-hundred frustrated citizens crowding the auditorium. Jack is at the podium, with town officials, including the local mayor, sitting on stage as well. Currently, Mrs. Babbit, 52, speaks into the microphone on the floor. The town roars its approval as Jack, impotent, tries. The town erupts in agreement. A short, bald man of 65, Mr. McCandless, speaks. The mayor takes over as Jack has a sidebar meeting with Mr. Jack continues into. The camera dollies fast with an exasperated Jack as he writes, tailed by. He heads for his office, seeing Louis, who is being escorted out by an officer across the room. Louis heads out as Jack turns, enters his office, and as that door opens, the door of his messy, motherless room opens. Joe and Alice enter. He could not be more self-conscious. He moves stacks of comics, tosses some dirty clothes behind the bed, including a pair of underwear and socks. He closes the closet and hangs a bath towel on his desk chair. She looks around as she enters. Alice sits on the bed. Joe takes the five-car train model. She moves close. Alice holds it. Joe watches her. She really looks at it. Their tension is interrupted by an out of breath Charles. Jack is with Officer Tally, 24. Tally puts a map on his desk showing 28 dots in a circle, anywhere from a 20 to 150 mile radius, with Lillian at the center. Jack is stunned. Officer Rosko is at his desk with a young woman, a ham radio at his desk beside a reel-to-reel tape deck. He takes notes. Cary is behind the camera, with Charles beside him. As it continues, Alice is seen behind the camera, watching Joe, smiling.",
    "136": "Gandhi sits under a tree, peeling potatoes. Nehru and his friends are sprawled out around him. Beside them, the river; in the background the business of the ashram goes on. Gandhi has finished the last potato. He glances at Nehru then drops the potato in the bowl. He lifts the pail of peelings to Nehru. Nehru in his fine linen suit takes the pail awkwardly. His friends watch with amusement, but they too rise to follow as they head for the kitchen. Nehru has half risen in his seat to address Charlie Andrews, who, walking from one somnolent building to another, has stopped dead at the sight of the car. He re-directs Nehru toward a trough where two or three goats are tethered, but he keeps right on talking. They have reached the trough. He meets Nehru's gaze, and for a moment something deeper than argument passes between them. Then something catches Gandhi's eye. He looks off. Ba stands, watching him, waiting. Gandhi turns. The goat is reaching for his bowl of potatoes. He pushes it away and starts for the kitchen. Nehru grins, captured by Gandhi's seriousness, and his humor. He hasn't moved, and neither have his friends. They watch Gandhi as he carries his bowl of potatoes to Ba. Gandhi plods on toward the kitchen, carrying the bowl of potatoes. The others laugh; Nehru suffers. His smile is sardonic, but genuine, theirs embarrassed and self-conscious. He looks around the ashram a little dismally. Ba and an ashramite woman squat by the river, washing clothes. Clothes are dipped in the brownish water. It is long past the monsoons and they have had to come far out in the riverbed to the water. But they are laughing at their task. Gandhi sits cross-legged, watching solemnly as Shukla reaches with his fingers into a bowl to eat. The fingers are thin, half-starved, like the man himself. He looks up at Gandhi almost sheepishly. Ba sits at one side in the shadows watching him as intently as Gandhi. His voice is choked and near to tears, resonant with the unspoken agony his words mean for him and the others like him. He looks at Gandhi nervously for a moment, then puts the food to his mouth like a man who is starving, and trying desperately not to show it. The solemn intensity of her gaze reflects her identification with the man's agony. She glances up at Gandhi. The camera is low, shooting along the track toward the light of an approaching train. From its distant glow we can see that people line the platform of the small station, waiting, but we cannot tell how thick the crowd may be. The station house.",
    "1361": "Abby steps away, not wanting to ponder Larry's balls anymore than she has to. She walks in on a shouting match between JOSH, a leftist angry news writer, and DORI, the entertainment-leaning co-writer. JAVIER, the new fat weatherman, takes a huge bite. They all laugh. Abby talks to STUART WARDLOW, 60's, KPHX's curmudgeonly general manager. Abby looks worried. Abby nods. She rips out an extra two feet of floss. She holds up her clipboard, which has the guy's E-Harmony PROFILE and PHOTO. Abby stops flossing and looks at Joy. There's an awkward silence between them. She pulls out another piece of paper, and hands it to him. She hears a noise coming from her bedroom and looks to see D'Artagnan's paw in the fish bowl, trying to scoop up a goldfish. He holds up several books in his hands, reading the titles. He drops the books on the floor, picks up a can of gasoline and pours it on the books. Mike shoves a burnt marshmallow into his mouth. He mimes swallowing. WE PAN off the television to the bed, where Abby now watches, appalled. Mike hangs up the phone. Abby, now infuriated, picks up the phone and begins dialing. WE INTERCUT between the stage and her apartment, as Mike continues his rant. Irritated, Abby begins to compulsively remake her bed. Mike bowls over LAUGHING. Abby and Joy make their way into the conference room. Dori and Josh are already there. ON TV: Mike's face appears. Joy looks at Abby. Abby holds up a piece of paper. Stuart takes the memo, reading it. Abby spins to face Stuart. Abby is pacing, clearly on the verge of hysteria. A KNOCK. Then the door opens and Mike appears. Abby glares at him. He stares at her, surprised. Abby gags as she pushes past him and walks out. Abby strides down the hall with Georgia and Larry. Mike gives a cocky wave. Abby and the control room crew watch the proceedings. In the control room, Abby smirks. Cliff shrugs. In the control room, Abby looks like she's going to pass out. Larry grabs Georgia and kisses her hard. After a moment of resistance, she melts into his arms. Larry throws Georgia over his back and hauls her off the set. Abby is sitting in a ball in her closet. Mike's sister, ELIZABETH, 40's, walks in, wearing a nurse's uniform and holding a cake box. She hands him the cake box. She gives him a kiss on the cheek. He grins. She fumes, jabbing the earpiece in his ear. He crosses to -- a CANDLE-LIT TABLE with a fancy dinner placed in the center. Several books rest beside it. Beside the table, a man plays violin.",
    "1365": "Debbie gets out of the shower. Pete follows. Pete sneaks down the hallway. He kisses Sadie as he wakes her. She wants to be left alone. Pete breathes all over her as he talks. Pete lifts a sleeping Charlotte out of bed and walks her downstairs. It looks ridiculous because she is too tall to hold her like she is a baby. Pete and the kids set up a tray of muffins and donuts on the table and decorate the room with birthday balloons, streamers, etc. Pete sneaks bacon, cupcakes, and mini donuts into his mouth occasionally. The house is a bit more cluttered and messier than when we last saw it in Knocked Up. Debbie opens a window and sneaks a cigarette. Sadie watches Lost on her iPad while Pete and Debbie talk in the kitchen. Pete clears the breakfast dishes. He turns on the faucet and pours water on the cupcake. Charlotte plays the theme from The Office on her keyboard. Sadie tears apart her closet looking for clothes. Debbie is in workout gear. Pete enters wearing a lycra outfit with all sorts of logos on it. Debbie leaves. Pete picks the soaking wet cupcake out of the sink and takes a bite. Debbie runs up a long flight of stairs with her trainer Jason. Her friend Barb trails behind. We see Pete in a large group of bikers riding down San Vicente. Pete's friend Barry is part of the group. A car makes a right turn in front of Pete, nearly hitting him. Pete bangs on the back of the car. Debbie is doing sit-ups while talking to Jason, who holds her feet down. In the background, Barb stretches on a yoga ball. Jason demonstrates. Pete and Barry eat frosted scones, happy to get some alone time to delay their return home. The family is driving. Sadie watches an episode of Lost on an iPad. Sadie stares at her iPad. We see a violent scene. Charlotte grabs for Sadie's iPad, then starts trying to lick her. Pete and Debbie get out of the car and walk down the street. Pete and Debbie enter and we see their two employees, Jodi and a new, gorgeous employee, Desi, who is up on a ladder. Debbie goes behind the register. She looks at Jodi. Pete is still staring at Desi on the ladder. Pete walks over to Debbie. Desi comes down to help a customer at the front of the store. We see quick cuts of Debbie playing with the kids on the trampoline outside. She does a full flip and lands on her feet. Pete is nowhere to be found. Debbie walks down the hall and into the bathroom without knocking.",
    "1367": "Debbie is getting a mammogram. The machine clamps too hard on her breast. She screams. Pete gets his testicles examined. Debbie is getting a colonoscopy. Debbie has some sort of very painful oral surgery. She's a little high from the laughing gas. Dr. Bowe has his finger inside of Pete's anus, giving him a prostate exam. Debbie is at the Gynecologist. He is the same one from the beginning of Knocked Up, DR. PELLIGRINO. Debbie's legs are up in stirrups. Two nurses enter the exam room. Debbie comes in the bedroom. Sadie runs down the hallway. Charlotte tries to open the door, it's locked. Debbie is giving Pete a blow job out of frame. Pete is sitting on a chair, super happy. Charlotte shoves Sadie. The fight between Sadie and Charlotte escalates and becomes physical. Muffled screams from the girls outside. Pete walks to the front door. His father, LARRY, greets him. A low flying 747 lets us know he lives too close to the airport in a small house. Pete sits down and talks with Larry. Two other identical children enter and jump on Larry. The three exit. Larry stands up and walks outside. Pete follows. Larry prepares to spray the kids with the hose. Larry sprays him with the hose. Larry's wife, CLAIRE, enters. Larry gets up and walks outside. A nervous Debbie approaches a hostess. Debbie sees OLIVER (65) sitting stiffly at a table. Oliver takes out his iPhone and starts showing Debbie photos. He exits. Debbie picks up his iPhone and sadly scrolls through all the happy pictures of his new family. The family's hanging out, relaxing at dinner. Charlotte holds her iPhone to her face using an app that animates her mouth to look like a talking monkey's. Charlotte holds the iPhone monkey app to her lips again. Sadie gets up and stomps off. She walks off. Pete and Debbie drive down the Pacific Coast Highway. The car pulls up to a beautiful hotel in Laguna. Pete makes a wood chipping splatter noise. Pete runs into the bathroom. He looks for the cookie. Pete and Debbie eat the cookie. They sit in silence for an incredibly long amount of time, staring through each other in a haze. They are stoned. They're laughing and having a good time. Stoned, Pete and Debbie jump up and down on the bed. They fall down on the bed, kissing. Almost totally under the covers, they watch as a WAITER brings in a room service cart full of food. Pete does magic tricks for the waiter. Debbie hands Pete a banana and two oranges, which he holds to his crotch in front of the waiter. Pete eats a bite of the banana.",
    "1374": "Fred You said. They roll around fighting on the floor and the crowd cheer. The room suddenly becomes silent as Viktor Krum walks in and puts his name in the flame. He looks at Hermione and she smiles. Dumbledore approaches the blue flame and it glows red. A name comes out. Everyone looks on anxiously. The Durmstrang crowd cheer. Another name comes out. The Beauxbatons girls cheer as Fleur walks up. Another name comes out. Hogwarts pupils cheer as Cedric takes the stage. People cheer, but the goblet glows red once more and another name flies out. Dumbledore takes it and reads. Harry slowly walks up. Dumbledore gives him the paper. Harry is in a room with the other champions. Dumbledore bursts in and grabs Harry. Harry is silent. A woman appears in a puff of smoke. She's well groomed and dressed colorfully. The four tri-wizard champions are stood together in a group. She walks over to them and shakes each of their hands. She takes Harry by the hand into a closet. An owl flies in with a letter for Harry, he takes it and begins to read. The owl nips Harry's finger. The fire flares up a little, a face appears in it. Ron enters the room. Ron leaves. Harry goes to the fire again but Sirius is gone. Neville waves. Hermione and Ron are walking up to them. Ron whispers some words to Hermione. It's clear Ron and Harry are not on speaking with each other. Hermione walks up to Harry. Harry and Hagrid are walking through a dark forest. Hagrid is looking more dapper than usual and is carrying a big red flower. Madame Maxime calls out to Hagrid. Harry does as he's told. A huge flame fires up. We're zoomed in on a badge, it depicts Cedric on a bright yellow background. As Harry walks along other pupils aim insults at him saying he stinks. A young boy runs past. Harry gets to a doorway, two pupils stand in his way. They laugh, Harry pushes his way through. He approaches Cedric who is standing around with his friends. Cedric's friends hurl off more insults. Ron and Seamus are walking along. Harry approaches them. Draco calls out, he's sitting up a tree. Harry walks away and Draco angrily tries casting a spell. Mad-Eye appears and quickly turns Malfoy into a ferret. Mad-Eye is making the ferret hover around. He sends it up the trouser leg of one of Draco's friends. He squirms and looks uncomfortable. Everyone else is laughing. Mad-Eye winks to Harry and he laughs. Eventually it comes back out and McGonagall turns Draco back to normal. Draco runs away. Mad-Eye shouts after him. Mad-Eye takes off his prosthetic leg and takes a seat.",
    "1375": "The crowds are cheering, people are taking bets. Harry is pacing nervously. Hermione is standing by the tent door whispering in. Hermione enters the tent and they hug. A bright camera flashes, Rita Skeeter the journalist approaches. Rita leaves and Dumbledore enters. The champions gather around him in a circle. Barty holds up a bag. Fleur takes out a little green dragon. Viktor takes another out. Cedric picks one. Harry puts his hand in the bag and pulls out the dragon. The cannon fires immediately. Harry is sitting alone nervously. Harry enters the rocky arena. The crowd are cheering his name. He sees the golden egg sitting alone, he makes a run for it but the dragon appears. Harry's forced to retreat behind a rock as the dragon flames him. Harry stumbles and falls around the arena. Harry summons a broom. He jumps on and flies off, the dragon gives chase. The dragon bursts through the crowd and they look stunned. Harry is flying at high speed around the Hogwarts buildings. The dragon cuts him off and whips him off his broom, he lands on the roof of Hogwarts, hanging on for dear life. The dragon is clambering across the roof, strewing tiles as it goes. Harry reaches his broom but it's stuck. He jerks it loose and lets go of the roof just in time before the dragon swipes at him. He falls a long way but regains control. He flies on to an area with a bridge, he flies through a gap in the bridge but the dragon crashes into it and falls into the water. The crowds are mostly silent. We see Harry flying towards us and the crowd erupts. He goes straight for the golden egg. Harry is lifting the golden egg, people around him cheering. The Weasly twins have Harry sitting on their shoulders. Seamus hands Harry the golden egg. Ron appears in the doorway. Harry is looking at Cho. When she looks back he spills drink from his mouth. They laugh at him. A young boy walks up holding a package. Nigel is gazing at Harry. Nigel leaves. Hermione laughs. Groans emerge from the boys who are listening on. The girls seem a lot more excited. They try. She grabs Ron and pulls him up to dance. He does so and a wolf whistle comes from the crowd. The girls instantly stand and walk forward, the boys are all still seated. Neville stands. Groups of girls are giving them icy looks and turning their backs. Hagrid and Madame Maxime are walking together. They laugh together and have a moment. Viktor Krum is training, a group of girls are following him around. Severus Snape walks past and slaps Ron over the head.",
    "1378": "Harry sees something shining in the distance and he moves towards it. Viktor tries to zap him but misses. Harry ducks and Viktor gets zapped by Cedric. Cedric runs up and kicks the wand out of Viktor's hand. He points his wand at Viktor's body as if to finish him off, Harry runs up and intervenes. They struggle. The two of them begin running towards the cup. The undergrowth grabs Cedric and he falls to the ground. Harry looks back. Cedric is pinned down with no means of escape. Harry zaps the plantlife and Cedric wriggles free. Harry helps him up. The wind starts blowing again. Harry and Cedric have ported to a graveyard. Harry lets out a shout and holds his head, he is in pain. We see Wormtail and Voldemort nearby. Wormtail casts a spell and kills Cedric. Cedric lays dead on the ground. Wormtail pulls Harry closer, a status grabs hold of Harry and traps him. Wormtail drops something into a cauldron, Harry watches on. A bone hovers in the air under Wormtail's control, he drops it into the cauldron. He takes a knife and slashes his arm over the cauldron. He takes the knife to Harry and cuts at his arm. Harry shouts. Wormtail takes the knife over to the cauldron and lets the drops fall into it. The cauldron bursts into flame and a reformed Voldemort emerges. Wormtail hands him the wand and bows deeply. Wormtail looks concerned, but does it anyway. Voldemort sticks the wand into Wormtail's arm. The sky changes, others have been summoned. Voldemort begins slashing angrily at the hooded figures. Voldemort grants Wormtail a new hand. Harry struggles to get free. Voldemort puts his hand on Harry's head and he screams. Voldemort forces Harry to bow with magic. Voldemort casts at Harry and he wriggles in pain. Voldemort pulls Harry to his feet, Harry begins to move away. Harry takes steps toward Voldemort. They both cast and their streams of magic meet. They both struggle. Shapes form in the surrounding magical energy. The connection breaks, Harry runs over to Cedric's body and summons the cup over to them. In an instant they port out. Voldemort looks angry. Back at the arena Harry appears with Cedric's body. Harry weeps on Cedric's body. Amos breaks down wailing. The crowd look on distraught. Mad-Eye Moody enters and closes the door behind him. Harry is in the room still sobbing. They sit. Harry nods. We see Harry's arm, it has a skull and snake marking. Mad-Eye starts shaking and struggling for air, he reaches for his bottle but it's empty. He rushes to a chest with other bottles and struggles to find one. A flash of magic occurs and Mad-Eye is knocked into the wall.",
    "1382": "As the Whomping Willow begins to thrash, its violence oddly muted at this distance, Lupin takes a stick, pokes a knot on the trunk. Instantly, the Willow calms. We look UPWARD, see the tops of the trees etched against the darkening sky. BATS fly TOWARD us. We FOLLOW one, when Buckbeak snags one. A tail twitches briefly between his beak, then -- SLURP! -- is gone. Harry and Hermione sit together in the lengthening shadows. Hermione looks at Harry. Hermione nods, not wanting to press Harry further, then glances beyond the trees, toward the Whomping Willow. SHADOWS emerge under a FULL MOON: Black. Harry, Pettigrew, Lupin, Hermione, Ron, Sleepwalking Snape. Harry studies himself and Sirius. Hermione glances toward the Willow. Harry looks back to the tall grass. The werewolf is frozen. OWWWWWWW! This time, Harry doesn't stop her. Just then, a CHILL WIND rises. The LEAVES of the trees TREMBLE. EERIE SHADOWS flutter over the moon, greasy as smoke. Dementors. Hermione eyes Harry warily. He is transfixed, staring hungrily toward the outcrop. The Lake begins to freeze. WHOOSH! WHOOSH! One after another, Dementors drop from the sky, vanish in the cyclone. She looks. Desperately, her eyes flash to the cyclone, to the pitiful sight of Harry and Black at the water's edge. dying. Harry's face changes. He draws his wand. Harry slashes through the trees, down to the rocky outcrop, to the exact spot where his father appeared. Poising his wand, he looks out over the sea of Dementors on the other side of the lake. A WISP of SILVER escapes his wand, hovering like a MIST, then BLOOMS MAGNIFICENTLY. The trees EXPLODE WITH LIGHT. The Lake BLAZES with reflected FIRE. Harry stands utterly still, wand extended to the heavens. Across the lake, the Dementors retreat. Harry waits, still as a statue, until each and every one is gone. Then he simply lets his arm drop. WHOOSH! Harry and Hermione plunge INTO FRAME astride Buckbeak, SOARING toward the castle. Hermione contemplates this. Sirius paces within a SMALL CELL, a man condemned. Stunned to see them. KA-BOOM! The CELL DOOR ROCKETS to the sky. Black claps his shoulder, looks him in the eye. With a twinkle in his eye, Dumbledore swings open the door. As Harry and Hermione enter, they catch the faintest glimpse of themselves across the room just as they EVAPORATE. Ron blinks. Turns. Frowns. Ron glances to the other side of the room. Hermione glances mischievously to Harry. Harry JUMPS. Lupin turns, smiles through haggard eyes. The Marauder's Map lies open on an otherwise bare desk. Harry nods, looks back to Lupin. Unable to disguise his shock at Lupin's appearance. Harry eyes the open desk drawers, the bare bookshelves.",
    "1383": "Harry turns back. Sensing something in the shadows across the street, he rises. Slowly draws his wand. Then he sees it. Something BIG. Darker than the shadows which conceal it. Something with WIDE, GLEAMING. Harry steps back. Afraid to look. Wand outstretched. He TRIPS, tumbles over the forgotten trunk. The tip of his wand BLAZES. BANG! TWIN BEAMS of BLINDING LIGHT spear the night. Stan eyes Harry suspiciously, nods slowly. As Stan grabs Harry's trunk, Harry peers into the shadows across the street -- now simply shadows -- and climbs aboard. Only BEDS. In one bed, a DISHEVELED WIZARD GRUNTS, turns over in his sleep. BANG! Ernie rockets away and the beds -- as one -- slide six inches to the rear. Harry drops onto the bed nearest, peers up at the CHANDELIER SWAYING directly above his head. Beyond the windscreen ONCOMING TRAFFIC WHIPS past in a blur. Stan, huddled in an armchair, peeks over The Daily Prophet, eyes Harry coolly, before disappearing once more. Stan grins with sinister delight, showing BAD TEETH. As the Shrunken Head CACKLES with delight, Harry peers out the windscreen, watches London careering by. Sure enough, directly ahead, a LITTLE OLD LADY is crossing the street. Ernie HITS the BRAKES HARD and Harry flies forward, palms to the window. The brakes pinch down, the bus stops inches from the old lady, and Harry flies back onto his bed. BANG! The bus rockets forward once more. As Harry rights himself, he notices the HEADLINE of Stan's Daily Prophet: ESCAPE FROM AZKABAN! Below, a sunken-faced MAN with long, matted hair glowers from a MOVING PHOTOGRAPH. Harry shakes his head, still staring at the man's face. Harry nods and, as he does, Black's eyes shift. Just then, a pair of DOUBLE-DECKER BUSES sweep directly toward the Knight Bus. Before can scream, the entire Knight Bus SQUEEZES DOWN and shoots the gap between the two onrushing buses. The Shrunken Head winces. As the Knight Bus rockets off, Tom and Harry are revealed, Harry glances up, reads the SIGN above: THE LEAKY CAULDRON. Tom drags Harry's trunk inside, then pauses and, with a FLICK of his wand, silences the car alarm. Harry trails Tom through the quiet room. The BARTENDER glances up, his gaze lingering perhaps a bit too long. A solitary WIZARD reads a book while, at his elbow, his COFFEE CUP STIRS ITSELF. Tom leads Harry upstairs. As Harry follows Tom inside, he finds a SNOW WHITE OWL (HEDWIG) perched atop a chair. Harry turns, finds a PINSTRIPED SILHOUETTE (CORNELIUS FUDGE) at the window, staring at the ghostly shadows beyond. Harry's reflection shivers in the glass, but the man doesn't turn. Tom takes a position against the wall, fishes a pair of WALNUTS from his pocket and -- CRACK -- crushes the shells between his palms.",
    "1386": "Hermione reads over the shoulders of others. As a flicker of fear passes through Harry's face, BEM, a Nigerian boy, stares grimly at the grainy image of Black. Beautiful flowers gleam in the dawn light, then, slowly begin to WITHER. The dew FREEZES, the grass grows brittle. Seconds later, the Dementors sweep by. A tall WARDROBE RATTLES VIOLENTLY as Harry, Ron and several classmates regard it warily. Ron JUMPS, glances at Hermione, then WHISPERS to Harry. Neville eyes the rattling wardrobe, steps forward queasily. Everyone LAUGHS good-naturedly. Lupin nods thoughtfully. Lupin leans close to Neville, WHISPERS. Neville's eyes POP OPEN in shock. Consider Lupin uncertainly. Neville nods nervously, takes a deep breath. SPARKS jet from Lupin's wand, strike the doorknob, and the wardrobe BURSTS OPEN. Instantly, Snape appears, eyes flashing hideously as he stalks forward. Neville backs away in fright. turns, sees Harry step forward expectantly. Concern flickers through Lupin's face. The Jack-In-The-Box pivots on its spring, its face tumbling toward Harry, becoming more sinister, transforming into a Dementor. Harry starts to raise his wand, then freezes, transfixed. The Dementor looms closer and closer, when. Lupin steps between, snaps his wand. Lupin studies him curiously. Harry looks up. Finds Lupin studying him. Lupin's eyes glaze in memory, then he blinks, smiles. Lupin turns, eyes Harry affectionately. Harry smiles vaguely. Harry, Ron, and Hermione exchange dark glances, when. Ginny emerges from the crowd, her face ashen. The students dash to the landing, where all THE PAINTINGS WHISPER FEARFULLY. Filch's rheumy eyes peer up, searching the upper shadows, then narrow. Filch extends a crooked finger. High up, near the ceiling, the Fat Lady cowers in a portrait not her own, trembling. As the students REACT, Dumbledore's VOICE cuts through. CLOCK TOWER DOOR: Great GROANING TUMBLERS fall. SPINDLES rotate. CYLINDERS -- one after another -- fire into place. WINDOWS: Iron SPIKES, sharp as razors, rise instantly. One by one, deep in the distance, the LIGHTS of the Great Hall go out. Dementors appear, COVERING FRAME, then separate like a curtain. CAMERA DRIFTS THROUGH the silent room, OVER an ocean of SLEEPING BAGS, FINDS Harry lying awake, staring at the net of stars glimmering beyond the highest window. A gentle CREAK is heard and Harry's eyes shift, see Snape pass through the great doors, converge with Dumbledore. Dumbledore gazes at the students, refusing to take the bait. As Snape's eyes glitter darkly, Dumbledore gazes out over the slumbering students. As Dumbledore's gaze finds Harry, he shuts his eyes, feigns sleep. As the students eye Snape with guarded curiosity, Malfoy finishes SCRAWLING something on a bit of PARCHMENT and balls it up in his hands. As he opens them, a MOTH flutters from his palms.",
    "1387": "Snape waves the moth away, blows out a candle and a slide show begins. An ancient woodcut of a horrific beast flickers at the front of the room. Ron frowns down at his book. As the class stares mutely at a slide of an attacking werewolf, Hermione waiting desperately for someone to respond to Snape's question, the moth flutters by Harry. A tiny cloud of moth dust mushrooms into the air and Harry lifts his palm. Malfoy's parchment has reappeared. Harry stares at the parchment. Malfoy has drawn a crude caricature of Harry in his Quidditch robes being struck by lightning over and over. Harry opens his eyes and Ron, Fred, George, and Hermione slowly come into focus, standing at the foot of his bed in the hospital wing. As Harry edges up against his pillow, we see a nurse in the background, removing the spokes of an umbrella from a Hufflepuff player's neck. Uncomfortable glances. He tips a bag of splintered wood and twisted twigs onto the bed. As Harry stares, we hear a gentle wind, then. Harry shakes his head in response to Lupin's question, then -- WHOOSH! -- sets Hedwig free of her traces. As she soars into the sky, Harry and Lupin watch from the lake's edge. The great doors open and Fred and George enter. The invisibility cloak drops and Harry is revealed, looking cross. Instantly, Fred slaps a worn roll of parchment into his hand. Harry unfurls it. It's blank. George touches his wand to the parchment and intricate ink lines surface in the fiber of the paper, spread like veins. Harry reads the curious words at the top. Trapdoor lifts. Harry's eyes appear. As he pulls himself up, a door bangs open. Quickly, Harry hides, watches a man's boots descend the stairs. Malfoy's eyes shift, regard Hermione with disgust. SPLAT! Malfoy takes a snowball to the grill. Splutters. Malfoy glances about in confusion, when -- SPLAT! SPLAT! -- he takes two more. Hermione and Ron glance about uneasily. Crabbe and Goyle start for Ron and Hermione, when -- FLUMPH! -- their knees go out and they fall headfirst into the snow. Draco begins to back away fearfully, eying the mist. Malfoy's ski mask is pulled over his eyes, he's spun about, given a rough kick to the ass and sent stumbling over the rise and out of sight. Ron and Hermione stand frozen, exchange a nervous glance, and dash off. When -- FLUMPH! -- they both go flying, land on their pants in the snow. As they sit up, they hear laughter. Hermione's eyes narrow in suspicion. The invisibility cloak drops. Harry grinning. But he's smiling. The trio trudge through the swirling snow.",
    "1389": "Snape turns. Sees Lupin standing in the shadows. Lupin takes the parchment, which now displays a rather unflattering caricature of Snape and a pair of potions. Harry walks aside a fuming Lupin, who grips the map fiercely. Harry walks silently. Harry lingers briefly in the doorway, absently eyes the WAXING MOON that glimmers beyond the window, then starts to turn away. Stops. Lupin hesitates ever-so-slightly, then returns to his papers. As Trelawney eyes Harry's crystal, Hermione rolls her eyes. Stung, Hermione starts to reply, but -- remarkably -- seems incapable of a single word. Rising gracelessly, she exits, knocking her crystal ball to the floor. Harry watches curiously as the ball rolls slowly OUT the doorway. Ron stops, glances at Harry, then moves off. Harry watches him go, along with the others, then spies Hermione's crystal ball lying on the landing. Harry sets Hermione's crystal back on its stand, starts to go, when the SMOKE within the crystal suddenly DARKENS. Leaning close, Harry watches the shape that appears. It is unmistakable: Sirius Black. Just then, a SHADOW crawls the glossy surface of the crystal and a HAND SNATCHES Harry's shoulder. He wheels, finds Harry stiffens. When it rises, she blinks, eyes the hand that lies upon Harry's shoulder. Her hand. Harry shakes his head. Harry -- clearly unsettled by his encounter with Trelawney -- hastens down the stairs, and we fade out. SWOOK! SWOOK! We FADE UP ON a MOVING POV OF a CROW as it glides to the flock circling the feet of a POT-BELLIED MAN (THE EXECUTIONER) sitting in the courtyard. As he sharpens his AXE -- SWOOK! SWOOK! -- we -- cut to HARRY, RON AND HERMIONE hurrying past. The Executioner looks up and we Harry, leading Ron and Hermione toward Hagrid's hut. She and Ron look and SEE Malfoy, along with Crabbe and Goyle, lurks within a grouping of monolithic menhirs, BINOCULARS in hand, spying on Hagrid, who stands in the pumpkin patch, tossing dead ferrets to Buckbeak. Malfoy stumbles back against a tree, cross-eyed with fear as Hermione jabs the tip of her wand under his nose, when she turns, surprised Ron's spoken to her. Hermione nods, then -- SMACK! -- quick as lightning, lands a looping right to Malfoy's jaw, putting him flat on his back. Stunned, he leaps to his feet and runs, Crabbe and Goyle huffing and puffing behind. The trio makes their way down the slope and past Buckbeak, chewing on a ferret with idle satisfaction. Hagrid stands by the window watching Buckbeak. Harry and Ron sit. The trio slip silently into a stand of trees. Beyond them, Hagrid's hut glimmers desolately in the dying sun. High in the CLOCK TOWER, a BELL begins to TOLL.",
    "139": "Gandhi has remained seated, pensive. Charlie studies him a moment. A little grin, but his mood remains pensive -- and remote. Gandhi looks up -- his anger, his determination there, but then broken by a hopeless sigh. Charlie is stunned, and obviously hurt. Gandhi proceeds more gently. And now Charlie understands. Gandhi smiles; warmth, and sadness. Then he speaks with a determined purposefulness, a friend's trust. He has taken some scratched notes from under the bedding and handed them to Charlie. He nods. Gandhi meets his eyes -- a smile that shelters Charlie's vulnerability, returns his love. The very English, very steadfast Charlie fights to contain his emotions. It is packed to overflowing; restless. Gandhi sits in the dock. The magistrate (English) is surveying the courtroom; he signals his clerk (English) to him. The magistrate frowns. We see the front row from his point of view. Two or three Indian journalists and one European. The magistrate receives that news with some alarm. He indicates that the clerk take his place. Gandhi stands. The courtroom is silent, but we can still hear the sound of the chanting outside. The magistrate stares. The journalists write. The clerk swallows. The magistrate looks around the courtroom and is only too aware of the mob outside. The clerk lowers his eyes to his pad. The magistrate searches the distant wall, the top of his desk, his twitching hands for an answer. Again the magistrate stares. And so do the journalists. The magistrate wets his lips. And now the court explodes. In the chaos of cheering and delight, the magistrate rises, looks around the room and heads for his chambers. The journalists are scribbling furiously. Gandhi turns and starts out of the courtroom. Gandhi steps down from the courtroom to the balcony. A huge cheer comes up from the massed peasants below. As he smiles down at them, he is turned by. Gandhi reacts -- with surprise and caution. Again Gandhi is surprised -- but even more cautious. It sounds casually ironic, but they look determined, even angry. The Governor, Sir Edward Gait -- the portrait of the King prominent behind him -- is feeling as cornered as Sir George but for different reasons. His desk is arrayed with several tall stacks of folders -- all with exactly the same covers -- and on one corner of the desk, some folded newspapers. He taps one of the folders irritably with his hand. Sir George looks at him -- half defensive, half defiant. They are old friends -- the same school, the same social class, long together in India -- and their argument is an argument between friends who accept the same premises. But even so the Governor feels the game has not quite been played fairly.",
    "143": "The crowd is running and screaming. He looks off at the crowd. His eyes narrow. A group of men are hurling themselves at a breach in the top of the wall, hanging there, scrabbling for a purchase, some disappearing, a few heroic individuals astride the wall reaching down to assist their women and children in the swirling crowd below. Dyer glances woodenly at the panel -- a man in some shock at the consequences of what he assumed was an act worthy of praise. The Advocate looks at him with a degree of disbelief -- more at his attitude than his statement. He stares at the panel like a reasonable man making a reasonable point. The evasiveness, the only half-buried embarrassment of their response only deepens his own withdrawal into himself. Dyer thinks about it. A muted reaction from the public section. The Indian barrister stares at him a moment, then simply lowers his eyes to his notes. For the first time there is the hint of uncertainty in his manner. There is just a tremor of distaste quickly suppressed among the panel. Dyer looks at him quickly. And that answer stops the Advocate. He smiles dryly. Dyer faces him stonily, a seed of panic taking root deep in his gut. Quiet: the same silence as at the Court of Inquiry. The camera is panning slowly along a section of the wall. We are close and see the bullet holes, the patches of splashed blood, the scratches where fingers have dug at the surface of the wall to claw a path to safety. And finally the camera comes to a close shot of Gandhi, matching that of Dyer, whom we have just left. He is surveying the wall in the now empty park numbly, desolately. Nehru stands a few feet away from him, his mood the same, the same benumbed grief and incredulity. The camera continues its pan -- bits of human hair matted in the dried blood, and the bullet-ripped foliage, the well, trampled ground around it, little pieces of clothing. The imposing capitol building of the British Raj in India. Chelmsford is pacing along one side of a large conference table. This time Gandhi is in the middle and speaks with the full authority of a leader. The Indian side acknowledges Chelmsford's disclaimer -- coolly, but accepting it. That lifts Chelmsford's hopes a little. It is spoken with the cold determination of a man still angry. The British are stunned almost to speechlessness -- the audacity, the impossibility of it -- and from Gandhi of all people. The senior civil servant, Kinnoch, is the first to recover. Gandhi and the others just look at him. Chelmsford is realist enough to recognize that a faux pas has been made, and he strives to get the meeting back on the course he intends.",
    "144": "He has deliberately if delicately caught the eye of both Jinnah and Maulana Azad during this. His smile flitters cynically on the mouths of the others on his side. He looks at them all, then up at Lord Chelmsford behind them. The top is lifted, whiskey pours. The camera pulls back. We are still in the Council Room, but time has passed. The Indian delegation has gone, and the British are relaxing as a servant pours. And they all laugh. There are some smiles, but not all of them are quite so amused. It is an instruction they all find correct. A roar of approval from a huge crowd. We are featuring two British soldiers, their faces partially lit by a flickering torch light that reveals their tense wariness. And we can see its cause. A huge crowd is gathered around a platform -- torches sprinkled through it -- and their mood is confident, belligerent. As their defiant roar carries through the night air we see that Gandhi sits cross-legged on the platform. Patel, now for the first time in an Indian tunic, and Azad, also in an Indian tunic. Desai, Gandhi's new male secretary, is with them. But it is Ba who is speaking at the microphone, who has brought the shout of defiance from the crowd. It is the end of her speech and she makes the pranam and turns away. There is applause and noise, but Ba does not acknowledge it; she simply sits cross-legged behind Gandhi, who is talking with Patel and Nehru. At last he rises, and the noise and applause increase to something like chaos. In close shot we see other British soldiers watching on the perimeter of the crowd and they are now made even more wary by the enthusiasm of this greeting. Gandhi fiddles with his glasses, preoccupied; finally he looks out over the crowd and holds up a hand -- almost lazily -- and gradually, but quite definitely, the crowd stills. We intercut with the crowd, listening raptly. Gandhi holds up one finger. Neither of these goals is easy, and the audience reaction shows it. Now Gandhi raises a third finger. And the crowd breaks into stamping and applause. Gandhi lets it run for a time, then stills it with the one small gesture as before. This has sobered the audience somewhat. Now he looks out across them as though seeking something. There is an excited stir; he silences it. As suitcoats, shirts, vests, trousers, are flung into a pile. Featuring the two British soldiers -- later -- on the edge of the crowd, staring off, their faces now brightly lit by darting flames. A huge triangular pile burns before the platform, an excited half-naked crowd swirling in the shadows around it.",
    "147": "Gandhi struggles to turn, and Mirabehn helps him. When he turns we see that his face is wet with sweat from the dry heaving and his hands and arms are quivering and he cannot stop them. She looks at him nervously, then pours a glass from the pitcher. She turns back, and propping up his head, helps him to sip. Gandhi swallows with difficulty. He pauses, letting his head fall back and she lowers it down to the mat again. He tries to smile. Mirabehn looks daunted by his intractability. Gandhi signals her down to him. She bends so she is looking at the floor and he is speaking almost into her ear. We intercut their faces, very close, as he speaks. During the very last of it Mirabehn has turned her face to him, touched with emotion. She starts to pour water from the pitcher into the glass again, then she turns suddenly, her attention caught. Her point of view. The doorway. Nehru stands in it. Kallenbach and Desai are a step or two behind him. It is a victory. Gandhi's face cracks into a tearful grin. And Nehru chokes with emotion and laughter at the same time. He buries his head on Gandhi's hand, clutching it to him. Bright sunshine. A little boy is pulling a goat by a tether. He turns with a bright smile. Gandhi is walking, holding Ba's shoulder for support with one hand, and Mirabehn's with the other. Nehru stares at him and the policemen with growing incredulity. It stops Nehru. He looks at Gandhi and sighs in unmastered frustration, but he moves to Gandhi's side. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn. He laughs and Nehru struggles to join in the joke. A quiet hum in a packed courtroom. Armed sepoys line the wall. Featuring Judge Broomfield and the clerk. The Judge is flipping through documents on the case, a troubled frown on his face. At last, he shuts the folder and nods to the clerk. The clerk turns and says in a moderately loud voice. The sergeant-at-arms turns and moves to the door at the side of the bench. The courtroom immediately falls silent. The sergeant-at-arms opens the door -- a moment -- and Gandhi enters slowly. He has recovered a bit more, but he still moves slowly. As Gandhi enters, he lowers his glasses, places them on his desk, and rises, facing Gandhi. Featuring two English court reporters. One nudges the other in astonishment, signaling off toward the judge. The clerk, confused as well as astonished, see the judge standing, facing Gandhi in respect, and dutifully, he too stands. A disbelieving exchange of glances, the sound of others standing around them. The whole court rises, the astounded reporters the last of all.",
    "156": "Finally Azad takes just a step forward. Gandhi looks up at him. For a moment he folds his hands absently, then he stands. He moves to Ba's side and kneels. Ba's eyes flutter open. She holds her hand out to him and he takes it. When he goes to release it, she clutches it. Gandhi hesitates, and then he sits, holding Ba's hand in his lap. He looks across at Mirabehn and nods for her to go. Mirabehn smiles weakly, gives Ba a last little rub of farewell and stands. Patel stands, letting Mirabehn pass before him and do down the corridor with Azad. He looks back. Gandhi sitting, holding Ba's hand, his eyes once more on the floor in their empty stare. A fly moves along a small section of the floor that still contains a ribbon of the dying sunlight. Gandhi still sits, holding Ba's hand, staring into nothingness. The doctor appears in the doorway. He pauses, nods amiably to Gandhi, though Gandhi does not react to his presence at all. Moving quietly, the doctor goes to the other side of Ba and crouches, and lifts her wrist to feel her pulse. He holds it for a moment, then lifts his eyes in doubt and sudden fateful apprehension. He glances at her, then slowly lowers her arm and puts the branches of his stethoscope in his ears. He puts the acoustic bell over her heart. A moment, and he lifts it slowly, his face confirming for us what he and we already know: there is no heartbeat. He glances at Pyarelal, who only lowers his eyes. The doctor turns his head slowly to Gandhi. His posture is utterly unchanged, Ba's hand still in his lap, his eyes still staring emptily at the floor in front of him, but suddenly tears begin to run down his cheeks. The funeral pyre burns, its work almost done. Mirabehn, Patel, Azad, Pyarelal, stand with other prisoners and the military wardens in solemn obeisance to the dead -- and the living, for Gandhi sits a little distance from the pyre, wrapped in his shawl, staring at the dying embers in tragic and impenetrable isolation as though he may never move again. Close shot -- Mirabehn watching him her face wet with tears. A piece of cloth, shimmering in a stiff breeze. For a moment we hold it in silence and then we hear the sound of an aircraft growing louder and louder. And slowly the camera pulls back and we see that the cloth is part of a pennant of the nose of an aircraft. We cut from the pennant to see the aircraft stopping before a reception area, a carpet rolled out toward its door.",
    "160": "Nehru crosses and kneels so that he is almost at Gandhi's eyeline. Gandhi must take his eyes from his writing to look, and he is almost moved to tears at the sight of Nehru. His hand shakes a little as he holds it out to him. Gandhi turns to pat their joined hands with his other hand. He does so with effort, and at last he sees Patel. Patel sits near the head of the cot so the three of them are on a level. Outside the canopied area, Bourke-White is crouched, her camera framing the three of them. Gandhi smiles and reaches to touch hands with him. Gandhi shakes his head. But Nehru feels he has an antidote for that despair. Bourke-White captures the sense of elation in his face. From her discreet distance, she lowers the camera, holding it against her mouth, waiting for Gandhi's response. Gandhi nods to Nehru, accepting the news with a sad wistfulness. He glances at Patel, and we see that they recognize that their bland conviction that they could talk him out of the fast was deeply misplaced. Nehru turns back -- this time no confidence, only concern. Gandhi smiles, pain etched in his eyes. He touches Nehru's hand. Nehru stares at him, feeling the sudden fear that Gandhi means it. Patel, Mirabehn, Azad, Bourke-White are gripped by the same realization. An outside broadcast truck is parked among the usual crowd, grown even larger now, and more women among them. The crowd has spread from him all along the street; they stand against the walls of the houses staring at him, terrified to move. We see, just in passing, the frightened, apprehensive faces of Godse, and near him, Apte and Karkare. Nehru stands, staring at them all, his face seething with anger. On the cover is a picture of rioting men fighting and diagonally a cut-out of Gandhi lying on his cot. Mirabehn is rising, leaving the magazine at her feet. She moves to Nehru and Suhrawardy as Azad ushers them into the canopied area. Abdul Ghaffar Khan sits quietly in the background. Mirabehn speaks softly. Nehru looks across at Gandhi. The doctor, who is testing Gandhi's pulse yet again, glances at him -- no encouragement -- and moves away. Nehru moves to the side of the cot and Gandhi smiles weakly and holds out a hand, but he is in pain. Gandhi looks up at Suhrawardy, who nods. Gandhi looks back at Nehru. Gandhi smiles whimsically, he touches him again but there is no change in his attitude. Nehru looks at him hopelessly. A huge crowd, some smoke in distant buildings, some damage near to help us know this is still Calcutta, and all is not yet at peace.",
    "162": "He holds up his hand for attention. He forces a smile -- then starts reading. It is flat and dull, like someone reading a speech to themselves, and those in the crowd who had hesitated before wandering off shrug and continue on their way. Gandhi is unnerved by it a little but he struggles on -- louder, but just as colorlessly. This last has come more firmly, and he lifts his head to the crowd, as though expecting a reaction. Three or four committed supporters applaud as on cue, but his technique is so inexpert that it draws nothing but blank faces from the bulk of them. He glances nervously at Ba, who is embarrassed for them both now. He holds it up. A constable glances at the police sergeant. And he turns and drops his pass in the wire basket over the fire. The flames engulf it. The police sergeant's eyes go wide with disbelief. The crowd murmurs in shock. At last Gandhi has got a reaction, but the dropping of the card has been as matter-of-fact as his speaking, with none of the drama one might expect from so startling a gesture. He takes Gandhi's notes from him, and faces the crowd. It is the end of the speech. He looks at the crowd. Gandhi harrumphs -- gesturing to a shallow box Singh holds. Kahn turns back, extemporizing rather lamely. He is facing the crowd. Behind him, Khan holds himself erect and slowly takes his own card from his pocket. He holds it aloft and then lowers it resolutely into the wire basket. The crowd reacts and the sergeant turns just in time to see it dropped in the flame. He gestures to a constable, who turns from the crowd and marches to Khan, seizing him by the arm and marching him to the paddy wagon. As he passes the sergeant, the sergeant takes his billy club, and faces the crowd, rapping the club menacingly against his hand. Behind him, Gandhi wavers indecisively a moment, then takes the box from Singh and moves to the fire. Gandhi is at the fire. For a second, his eyes lock with the sergeant's -- and then nervously, he takes a card and drops it in the wire basket, and another. Again, a murmur from the crowd turns him. Gandhi, on his hands and knees, blood trickling from his abraded cheek, has picked up a card from the ground and he leans forward apprehensively, his eyes fearfully on the sergeant, but he drops it defiantly in the basket. The sergeant's fury bursts -- and he slams the billy club down on Gandhi's head. Gandhi sags to the ground. Ba screams. She starts to run to him, but the other women seize her.",
    "163": "There is silence, and an air of somnolence. We see the police commissioner, Suhrawardy, two doctors, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and some others. Nearer Gandhi, behind Mirabehn, are Nehru, Patel, Azad, and Pyarelal. Gandhi turns to Mirabehn, his face shaking, peering into her eyes. His weary eyes look at her; he looks up slowly to Azad. Gandhi looks at Nehru. Nehru just nods tautly. Gandhi looks down, then lifts his head to Azad. The relief brings water to their eyes and grins to their faces. Nehru bends to Gandhi. Gandhi holds his hand out to him, and Nehru clutches it. Another click of a camera. He is not fully recovered, but well on the way. We get a wide-angle shot now and see that Bourke-White is shooting one of her favorite subjects again. She is enjoying the banter, as is Mirabehn, who is spinning quietly to one side of the room, and Patel, who sits cross-legged like Gandhi on the floor. Pyarelal is working on papers with him but grins at this. And she shoots him again, as he hands the cloth back to Manu. Abha is sitting next to Manu, looking at a collection of pictures of Gandhi, obviously Bourke-White's. Abha suddenly holds a picture up for Gandhi to see. It's one of him, ears wide, eyes round. Gandhi taps her on the head with his finger as she smiles. But Bourke-White has looked from Patel to Gandhi, clearly shaken by the implication in Patel's words. Abha has signaled to the cheap watch dangling from his dhoti. He glances at it, and holds his arms out. The two girls help him. She is photographing his getting-up and leaning on the two girls. He moves off, but has a sudden thought and turns to Patel. Patel nods soberly and Gandhi starts for the door, Bourke-White moving with him. He has passed her, he's in the doorway. We see the crowd at the end of the garden, where the light of the day is beginning to soften. He turns, teasing in his slightly flirtatious way with women. She shoots him against the door -- the crowd milling distantly, waiting -- then she lowers her camera. He turns; the last words have betrayed the smile on his face; they have a painful sense of truth about them. Bourke-White watches as he moves into the garden toward the crowd in the distance. She turns to Mirabehn. Mirabehn accedes gravely. Bourke-White stares at her, then turns to look out at him. Mirabehn nods, but she keeps on spinning and tries to sound cynically resigned but her innate emotionalism keeps breaking through in her voice and on her face. Gandhi is moving forward in the crowd, one hand resting on Manu, the other on Abha.",
    "166": "This is where the magazine Indian Opinion is printed and we see stacks of it lying around. A short Westerner, Albert West, is running the simple printing press which is powered by a crude generator. A small staff is helping him, including a Sikh, a Muslim, a couple of Hindus, and two young boys. Gandhi and Walker are approaching the tent from the river, Gandhi discoursing earnestly. They've reached the entrance to the tent, and he gestures in. This last remark has been directed toward Charlie Andrews, who sits near them at a cluttered table, typing on an old typewriter. He waves, and Gandhi shouts out to them all over the putt-putt of the generator. They nod. One of the Hindus bows with his hands clasped together. Gandhi hands Walker a copy of Indian Opinion and they start across the relatively barren field toward some other tents, Walker glancing at the paper. Gandhi watches him, grinning. This carries a weight and apprehension that none of the rest of the conversation has. Walker measures Gandhi with a little surprise. Gandhi seems trapped by an ineluctable fact. Reluctant as it is, it too carries commitment and Walker senses it. But they have come by a site where a building is being erected, and a European, Kallenbach, is perched above a doorway on the half-completed structure, getting a level. Some Indians are working below him. Gandhi turns to him, light-hearted again. Walker waves his notebook at him and Kallenbach lifts his level in greeting. On his bronzed chest there is a Star of David. Walker looks around, grinning, shaking his head. We see two women in saris cleaning the toilet. Walker looks at him appraisingly. A moment of embarrassed doubt, then he starts toward a half-finished building -- wooden sides, door, but canvas still covering the roof. It has an awning spread before it. Walker's carriage is tethered nearby, a Black driver standing in the sun, waiting. In the background we see two women cleaning a latrine. Walker glances at the latrine. Ba looks at him coldly. She turns back and walks into the building by the rear entrance. Gandhi is disconcerted by her attitude, but he tries to answer Walker. A grin -- but forced. When a girl, Sora, comes from the building bringing another cup and place setting, Gandhi calls to the driver. And he goes into the building, determined to find the source of Ba's aloofness. Ba is sitting sullenly on a carpet near the rear entrance to the building. He crosses and stands in front of her with all the irritation of a husband. It is hushed, aware that Walker might overhear them, but bristling with suppressed anger. Now Ba looks at him hostilely.",
    "168": "Another cheer. When it subsides, Tyeb Mohammed rises near the back, where he is seated with a number of other young men. The police half rise to look back at him, but there is a smattering of applause and several stand to look back. Gandhi waits, then. He looks at the audience. This is the more sober Gandhi they have come to know. He looks down at the police, making the point stick. There is a tentative reaction from the audience, but uncertain. He has their attention now. And now he gets the response he has wanted. Firm, mature, determined. Gandhi holds up his hand. He looks at the audience. A second, then a merchant stands, signifying his pledge. Then Tyeb Mohammed and the youths about him. Then all over the theater they begin to stand and on the stage until everyone is standing. Gandhi looks at the full theater -- all standing. He takes a step forward. A prison door slams: we are close on one face, another slam, another face, and again and again in the rhythm of marching feet. Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed are leading a large procession of Indian mine workers along a dirt road from a mining complex -- sheds, elevator platforms, pulleys -- toward a distant city. Tyeb Mohammed suddenly touches Gandhi's arm and nods ahead. A canvas-topped open touring car (circa 1910) pulls out from a turning between two factory buildings and comes towards them. There is a little hesitation in the ranks as the car approaches. In it we can see two uniformed policemen and a civilian. The car swings across the center of the road and stops right in front of Gandhi. The civilian smiles slowly. He looks from Gandhi to the miners. The civilian looks at him sharply, then smiles derisively, signaling the car off. As it pulls away, Tyeb Mohammed and Singh come up to Gandhi, both made wary by the man's evident satisfaction with what has transpired. Gandhi watches the disappearing car worriedly, then turns and signals the miners on. They start forward. The car rides on past the factory building out of which it turned, and suddenly mounted police come swinging out from the buildings and face the procession. Tracking back before Gandhi, Singh and Tyeb Mohammed as they move forward, fear suddenly making their pace more labored. Tracking back before the mounted police. They come on fast, batons at the ready. Gandhi screws up his courage, marching on. Tyeb Mohammed sets his jaw in defiance. Singh forces himself along at Gandhi's side. The mounted police riding on, batons at the ready. He is in the front rank of the procession, watching the horses approach. He has a blunt farmer's face.",
    "169": "Chili watches a woman on the sidewalk pause to tighten the scarf around her neck. Chili turns and studies Tommy a moment. Then, Tommy looks at him. As he gets up from the table, the other men around the table follow his lead as he finishes up some jokes. He merely watches in the glass as Tommy turns up his collar and steps out into the cold Miami day. A moment later the MANAGER, an old Italian guy in a black suit, joins him in the doorway. The Manager looks OFF SCREEN, and begins speaking in Italian. Chili stares straight ahead, rubs his hands together, tries to stay warm. Tommy drives. Chili points out the window. Tommy looks up at the hotel as Chili takes a pair of leather gloves from top of the dash, opens the door. As Tommy pulls up out front. As Chili knocks on the door three times. He waits, pulls the right-hand glove on tight, so that when RAY BONES opens the door, Chili nails him one punch. Chili and Tommy each sit in a barber chair, reading the newspaper while Fred and Ed sit nearby playing checkers. A car pulls up. Chili's no longer listening to Tommy, but now watching as Ray Bones and a BLACK GUY get out of the car. Ray Bones eyes Chili, then nods to Fred and Ed. Tommy looks over as Ray Bones - smaller bandage on the top of his head - and his man enter the shop. The two guys leave as the Black Guy steps up to Chili. Chili exchanges a look with Tommy, watches as 'Mr Bones' goes down the hall into the back office, then turns to the black guy. Ray Bones comes out with the collection book open, looking at all of the names of who owes what. Ray Bones steps over to Chili. Ray Bones checks his man to get some appreciation, but the guy's too busy looking at the hair rinses and shit on the counter. Tommy watches as the Black Guy picks up a pair of scissors, runs his hand along the edge. Ray throws the book at Chili and walks out, his man right behind him. Ray Bones then nods to his man who grabs Chili, holds the point of the scissors to Chili's throat. Chili looks over at Tommy. Where Chili sits with FAY DEVOE - thirties, attractive, in a sundress - on her patio. They each have a drink. She looks at him. Touches her drink to the side of her face. They sit there in silence a moment. Fay reaches over, puts a hand on his leg. Chili finishes his drink, sets it down. She finally looks at Chili.",
    "172": "He reaches for the script. Harry backs away, holds the script to his chest. Bo Catlett notices this. Bo Catlett eyes him a beat, then pushes out of his chair. Bo Catlett nods, gets up. Ronnie sits up straight. Ronnie opens his coat so that Harry can see a gun tucked in his belt. Bo Catlett gives Ronnie a look. Bo Catlett glances once more at Chili then follows Ronnie out the door. Harry stares at the door a moment, senses Chili staring at him. Chili looks at Harry. Chili shakes his head as Harry sits down in one of the chairs, fumbles for his cigarettes. Chili's minivan is parked outfront. Obviously losing it now, rubs his eyes and quickly walks off to a row of payphones. Chili sits at the desk on the phone. They consider each other a moment until Chili finally checks his watch. Karen looks caught, doesn't answer right away. Chili lets that sink in a minute. Leo sits down in the arm chair, stares sadly at the briefcase. Leo nods. He picks up the briefrase as he rises from the sofa and Leo gets out of his chair. Chili reaches for the door, opens it and looks back at Leo. As Chili starts for the elevator. Chili drives a dark road up into the park. Chili pulls in behind a row of trailers. He gets out of the car and heads for the set where Harry is now looking up at the sky and yelling at someone. He rounds a corner, and we see an explosion of light up ahead as we come upon. As he starts back, he sees Leo's scared look just before he slams the door shut. Leo steps into his doorway. Chili shakes his head, starts back for the elevator. Chili stops, turns around. Chili says nothing, sits down in one of the red leather chairs. Bo Catlett smiles at him, doesn't give up the script. Bo watches as Chili picks up a copy of the script, begins flipping through it. Chili flips through the script, sees a name. Karen smiles, decides to wait a moment. Chili, lost in the movie, keeps mouthing the dialogue. As Tanya/Marlene Dietrich resumes her slow walk away, Karen sits down at the end of the row. People start getting up to leave. Chili turns to a GUY a few seats away from him. The guy gives Chili a look, puts his arm around his DATE, and quickly starts up the aisle so that Chili can now see Karen sitting there at the end of the row. She gets up, they start up the aisle together. As Karen and Chili exit the theater, stand there a moment.",
    "183": "Two headlights appear in the darkness, backlighting the rain that pours down on a lonely strip of highway. A station wagon HISSES along the wet road surface. MARION, 30, drives. Next to her in the passenger seat is SAM LOOMIS, a clinical psychiatrist. He is a tough-looking man in his forties who flips through pages in a manila folder. Loomis glances at Marion as she lights a cigarette. She shoves the matches into the pack and tosses it on the dashboard. Loomis stares at the cigarette pack. They look up ahead. Standing by the side of the road is a MALE PATIENT, a wild-looking man in his sixties dressed in a white gown, who stares at the station wagon. Marion slows the station wagon and pulls off to the side of the road. Loomis jumps out. Through the windshield we see Loomis rush over to the patient, stand and talk for a moment, then hurry back. CAMERA MOVES with Laurie as she walks down the residential street. She carries a large bundle of school books in her arms. Across a backyard TOMMY DOYLE, an eight-year-old boy with tossled brown hair and bright blue eyes comes running with his books. He catches up with her and they walk along down the street. They walk up to the front of the old, two-story Myers house set back from the street. Laurie holds up a key. Laurie walks through the front gate and starts up toward the porch. Laurie strolls up to the front porch. She bends down, lifts the welcome mat and places the key under it. Through a frost window, we see Laurie bending over the welcome mat. Suddenly a DARK SHAPE, THE OUTLINE OF A MAN, leans forward, watching her. As she walks back to Tommy at the street THE SHAPE MOVES TO WATCH THEM, then fades back into the interior of the house. Laurie and Tommy continue walking down the street. Tommy breaks stride and runs across the street. We see Laurie walking off down the street in the distance. CLOSE TO CAMERA the DARK SHAPE MOVES INTO FRAME, watching Laurie disappear around the corner. Loomis reaches a car and unlocks it. Loomis gets in the car. Loomis starts up the car and pull away from the sanitarium. Wynn watches him go, then hurries back into the building. Laurie sits at the back of a classroom of HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. CAMERA PULLS BACK, revealing the blood-stained butcher knife in his hand, then further back. Mother and Father stare at the POV, at first in puzzlement, then slow, growing horror. CRANING UP past his parents standing there, up from the neighbor's house to a HIGH SHOT of the neighborhood as the sounds of POLICE SIRENS rise in the distance.",
    "186": "Annie's car pulls away. Behind Brackett, Sam Loomis walks up the street. Brackett smiles as Loomis walks up behind him. As they talk, the camera slowly moves around them to a view of the street. Loomis' station wagon moves by behind them. Through the blowing trees, we see the full moon rising in the night sky. Annie's car moves down a quiet little residential street and pulls up in front of a two-story house set back from the street: the Doyle house. We are in the front seat of the station wagon. Through the windshield, we see Laurie get out of Annie's car, say goodbye, and walk up to the Doyle house. Then Annie's car makes a wide U-turn in the street and starts down the other direction. The station wagon pulls forward and follows her. Annie stops three houses down the street and pulls into a garage. The station wagon stops several feet away. The shape gets out of the station wagon, close to the camera so we can't see him. He glances down the street. Gusts of wind blow the costumes of children going from house to house. The shape moves. The camera tracks behind him as he walks toward the Wallace house. The shape stops in front. We see Annie come out of the garage and walk to another two-story frame house: the Wallaces'. The front door opens. Through the front room windows, we can see Annie talking to the Wallaces as they put on their coats. The camera and shape quickly move behind a tree to hide from sight. The Wallaces step out of their house and walk to the garage. The shape steps out from behind the tree and stares at the house. Annie and Lindsey Wallace, a pretty little nine-year-old, stand in the doorway framed by the hall light. Annie closes the door. A police car pulls up in front of the Myers house. There are sounds of wind and chirping crickets. Brackett and Loomis get out and stand by the front gate. Inside, we see Annie turn on the TV. She goes to the mirror on the wall and begins to brush her hair. Looking down the side of the house, we see Loomis and Brackett walk up to the front porch. A broken, rusted rain gutter clangs back and forth against the house in the wind. The front door slowly opens. Brackett and Loomis stand in the doorway. It is totally dark in the house. Brackett's flashlight comes on, illuminating the two men. As they move through the house, the camera tracks with them. Suddenly Brackett stops. He trains his flashlight on a small object in the corner of the room. For a moment, Brackett doesn't speak.",
    "189": "Annie calculates a moment. Lindsey is back watching the TV Horror-thon. Lindsey's eyes light up. Annie and Lindsey come out of the Wallace house. Lindsey carries a bowl of popcorn. Annie has a coat over the negligee. They walk down the street to the Doyles. The wind blows strong and whips the negligee around Annie's legs. As the girls make their way down the street. The SHAPE steps into the glow of the streetlight and watches them. Tommy runs to answer it. He opens the door. Annie and Lindsey stand there. Lindsey sees the TV and runs into the living room. She takes off her coat; sits in front of the TV and eats her popcorn. She glances at Annie's coat. Laurie glances at Lindsey. Before Laurie can say anything else, Annie rushes out the door. Laurie closes the door and looks in at Tommy and Lindsey engrossed in the Horror-thon. Annie hurries across the back yard and steps into the garage. She walks to her car. She tries the door. Quickly she turns and walks out of the garage. Annie wanders through the empty house looking for her purse. She finds it in the front room, takes out her brush and lipstick and stands in front of the mirror primping. She glances up at her image in the mirror. Tommy hides, preparing to jump out and scare Lindsey. Lindsey gets up from the couch to search for Tommy. Lindsey turns around and looks for Tommy. For a moment, he glances out the window. The figure of a MAN carries what seems to be a BODY across the Wallace's back yard. Tommy SCREAMS and jumps out from the curtain, scaring the hell out of Lindsey, who also SCREAMS and begins crying. Laurie rushes in from the kitchen finding the children in tears. Tommy points out the window. Laurie bends down to comfort her. Tommy turns away from Laurie and Lindsey and walks over to the couch in front of the TV set. Almost instantly, Lindsey stops crying and follows him. Lindsey sits up next to Tommy and hugs him. Laurie shakes her head and walks back into the kitchen. The old Myers house looks ominous and foreboding silhouetted against the dark, whishing trees. CAMERA TRACKS behind the hedge where Loomis sits waiting. Suddenly, there are noises from the street. Three boys, Keith, Richie and Lonnie (from the playground) creep up to the edge of the sidewalk in front of the old house. They stare fearfully at the dark, tomb-like structure. Loomis parts the hedge in front of him and stares. For a moment Lonnie hesitates, then slowly moves through the front gate up toward the porch. He watches the young boy walk toward the house, unsure whether he should interfere or just watch.",
    "191": "CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking, and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly. A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles as Clarence speaks. The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is seen. The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young boys on top of a snow-covered hill. Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on large shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen river at the bottom of the hill. George Bailey at bottom of slide. As each boy comes down the others applaud. Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out onto the ice. On top of hill, preparing to make his slide. Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by the other boys, and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice breaks, and Harry disappears into the water. George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to pull him out he yells. The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain. When George reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety. Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling. Their attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the other side of the street. The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it. The boys watching the carriage. The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The drugstore is old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and little else. As the kids stop, George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish. He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up. George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl, is seated, watching him. George goes on to get his apron from behind the fountain. Mr. Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room. We see him take a drink from a bottle. Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the fountain. George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron. She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is infinitely older in her approach to people.",
    "192": "He drops the phone with a crash, grabs Mary by the shoulders and shakes her. Mary begins to cry. He pulls her to him in a fierce embrace. Two meant for each other find themselves in tearful ecstasy. Mrs. Hatch is at the top of the stairs. She practically faints at what she sees. Cousin Tilly's face fills the screen as she cries. CAMERA PULLS BACK, and we hear the SOUND of the Wedding March. People are crowded into the rooms: family, friends, neighbors. There is a din of conversation. Mary and George appear at the top of the stairs in traveling clothes, with Mrs. Hatch, red-eyed, behind them. Mary throws her bouquet, which is caught by Violet Bick. As they come out onto the porch, we see that it is raining. Nevertheless, Cousin Eustace has his camera equipment set up and is taking pictures of the group. George and Mary dodge through the rain and a shower of rice and get into Ernie's taxicab, which pulls away from the curb. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the maid. George and Mary are in each other's arms. Ernie reaches over and hands George a bottle of champagne done up in gift wrappings. The cab passes the bank, and Ernie sees a crowd of people around the door. He stops the cab. Scurrying people under umbrellas, swarming around the bank doors. Panic is in the air. Attendants are trying to close down. Several people come running past the cab. George gets out of the cab and looks down the street. George runs off up the street, toward the Building and Loan. They are simply-dressed people, to whom their savings are a matter of life and death. George comes in with an assumed cheerful manner. The people look at him silently, half shamefaced, but grimly determined on their rights. In their hearts there is panic and fear. An iron grill blocks the street entrance to the Building and Loan. A crowd of men and women are waiting around the grill. It has been locked. He quickly unlocks the grill door and pushes it open. Followed by the crowd, George runs upstairs and into the outer offices of the Building and Loan. George, followed by the still-silent people, comes in. Uncle Billy is standing in the doorway to his private office, taking a drink from a bottle. He motions to George to join him. George turns back cheerfully to the crowd. George vaults over the counter. The people ignore George and remain standing in front of the teller's window. They all have their passbooks out. George hurries into his office where Uncle Billy is waiting for him. He points to George's office. The telephone rings.",
    "196": "He waves as he exits through the door. A flaming plane crashes into the sea. George, behind the counter, is trying to quiet a crowd of people all clamoring for more ration points. George shouts. George, in the uniform of an air raid warden, is patrolling his beat. Man beside lighted window pulls down the shade as George blows his whistle. George is helping load his old car with scrap paper. Wheelbarrow full of junk being dumped onto pile. It is a raw, gusty day, and his overcoat and muffler flap in the breeze. George is walking along the sidewalk reading a newspaper. Draped around one arm is a large Christmas wreath. Under his other arm are several more copies of the paper. George comes to where Ernie, the taxi driver, is standing on the sidewalk. The front page of the paper, the Bedford Falls Sentinel. The subhead tells of a plan for a giant jubilee and parade, to be followed by a banquet, in honor of Commander Harry Bailey, U.S.N. on his way home from Washington after receiving the Congressional Medal of Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman pinning the coveted medal on Harry's bosom, in the midst of dignitaries; a picture of the transport which Harry saved. Practically the whole front page is devoted to the story. Gower comes running across the street from his drugstore and joins them. Uncle Billy is walking along the street, humming happily to himself. The outer door opens and George enters. The offices are unchanged, still small-time and old-fashioned. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are talking on the phone. The same office force, albeit a few years older: Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace. Seated on a chair is a middle-aged man with a brief case. Cousin Eustace has turned away from George and caught a glimpse of the man waiting in the chair. This is Carter, the bank examiner, come for his annual audit of the books of the Building and Loan. He gives the phone to Eustace, puts down his wreath and goes over to Carter. They shake hands. Uncle Billy is filling out a deposit slip at one of the desks. He grabs the paper from Potter's hand. Uncle Billy folds Potter's paper over the envelope containing his money, and flings his final taunt at the old man. In a cold rage, Potter grabs his paper and wheels off toward his office. Uncle Billy smiles triumphantly and goes toward deposit window with his deposit slip. Uncle Billy hands the bank book over. The teller opens it, starts to punch it with rubber stamps. Uncle Billy searches through every pocket he has. The teller, knowing the old man's vagaries, points to one of the numerous string tied around his fingers.",
    "199": "He turns his back to Zuzu, pretending to be tinkering with the flower. He sticks the fallen petals in his watch pocket, rearranges the flower, and then turns back to Zuzu. George puts the flower in a glass of water on the table beside her bed. They whisper. Mary comes in and picks up the phone. George enters shot, and stands listening to her. He snatches the phone from Mary. She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off. She cannot know that George's tirade against Mrs. Welch is really a tirade against the world, against life itself, against God. Mary succeeds in wresting the phone from George's hand. Mary speaks quickly into the phone. But the telephone is suddenly alive with a powerful male voice calling. Mary once more tries to take the phone from him. But before he can think of an insult to top Welch's, we hear a click on the phone. He yells at Tommy, noisily playing with his vacuum cleaner. Janie is still practicing at the piano, monotonously. The room has suddenly become ominously quiet, the only SOUND being George's labored breathing. George goes over to a corner of the room where his workshop is set up a drawing table, several models of modern buildings, bridges, etc. Savagely he kicks over the models, picks up some books and hurls them into the corner. Mary and the children watch, horrified. George looks around and sees them staring at him as if he were some unknown wild animal. Mary and the children stare at him, stunned by his furious outburst. There is silence in the room. Janie breaks into sobs. The sight of Mary and the children suffering is too much for George. He looks around him, then quickly goes out the front door of the house. Mary goes to the phone, picks it up. Potter is seated at his desk, his goon beside him. He is signing some papers. George is seated in a chair before the desk, without a hat or coat, covered lightly with snow. George turns and starts out of the office as Potter picks up the phone and dials. George is out of the door by now. CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to Potter. George comes out of the bank into the falling snow. He crosses the street, tugs at the door of his old car, finally steps over the door, and drives off. The place is an Italian restaurant with bar. The bottles sparkle. There are Christmas greens and holly decorating the place. It has a warm, welcoming spirit, like Martini himself, who is welcoming new arrivals. There is an air of festivity and friendliness, and more like a party than a public drinking place.",
    "202": "George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are two kids to him, and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter. George goes over to the candy counter. George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces. Violet gives him the money. Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, sticks out her tongue as she passes. George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish. He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her. He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her. She leans over, speaking softly. Mary, whispering. She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said. He turns back to the cash register, whistling. Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain. Gower comes to the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking. He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it. George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without comment and sidles back toward Gower. Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box. George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk. Gower fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor. Capsules spilling on floor at their feet. Gower waves George aside, takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris chair in the background. George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say. George turns a bottle around from which Gower has taken the powder for the capsules. George stands still, horrified. George's fingers fumble. His eyes go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison. George comes out into main room. With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street. Mary follows him with her eyes. He stops. Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the stairs. The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office. There is a counter with a grill, something like a bank. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin Eustace Bailey, the clerk. As George is about to enter his father's office, uncle Billy grabs him by the arm.",
    "206": "George comes running into shot. The wind is blowing as it has all through this sequence. He is frantically looking for Clarence. George leaning on the bridge railing, praying. George sobs. Suddenly, toward the end of the above, the wind dies down. A soft, gentle snow begins to fall. The police car pulls up on the roadway behind him, and Bert comes into scene. George backs away and gets set to hit Bert again. George touches his lips with his tongue, wipes his mouth with his hand, laughs happily. His rapture knows no bounds. He practically embraces the astonished Bert, then runs at top speed toward town. George's wrecked car is smashed against the tree. He comes running into shot, sees the car, lets out a triumphant yell, pats the car, and dashes on. He turns and runs through the falling snow up the main street of the town. He passes some late shoppers on the street. As he runs, he notices that the town is back in its original appearance. George notices a light in Potter's office window, and races across the street. Potter is seated working at his desk, his goon by his side. George pounds on the window. George runs off as Potter looks up from his work. The lights are on. The Christmas tree is fully decorated with presents stacked around. Carter, the bank examiner, a newspaper reporter and photographer, and a sheriff, are waiting in the hall for George. George comes dashing in the front door. He grabs his hand and shakes it. The photographer sets off a flash bulb. George runs to the kitchen. He gets no answer. He comes running back to the hall. The three children are at the top of the stairs. They are in their pajamas. George starts to run up the stairs, and the old familiar knob on the banister comes off in his hand. He kisses it lovingly and puts it back, then continues up the stairs. George and the kids. He is hugging them. Zuzu comes running out of her bedroom. George crushes her to him. As Mary comes through the door, breathless and excited. The four men are watching with open mouths. Mary races up the stairs, where George meets her in a fierce embrace. George and Mary embrace tearfully. He stops her with a kiss. She leads him excitedly down the stairs. Mary leads George, who is carrying a couple of the kids on his back, to a position in front of the Christmas tree. She runs toward front door and flings it open. Ad lib SOUNDS of an excited crowd can be heard. Uncle Billy, face flushed, covered with snow, and carrying a clothes basket filled with money, bursts in.",
    "207": "He is a very good-humored man of about fifty, in shirt-sleeves. During the foregoing, Cousin Tilly has answered the telephone, and now she calls out. Uncle Billy looking at his hand. CLOSEUP UNCLE BILLY'S LEFT HAND There are pieces of string tied around two of the fingers, obviously to remind him of things he has to do. He opens the door of his father's office and enters. George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a pad. He is a gentle man in his forties, an idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights. Nearby, in a throne-like wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power, sits Henry F. Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. He looks tired and worried. Goon pushes his wheelchair closer to the desk. The following dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for some time. George stands irresolute a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan Association, but aware more keenly of his personal crisis. George cannot listen any longer to such libel about his father. He comes around in front of the desk. He pushes George toward the door. As George passes Potter's wheelchair he pushes the old man's shoulder. The goon puts out a restraining hand. George proceeds toward the door, with his father's hand on his shoulder. George and his father at the door. Bailey closes the door on George and turns back to Potter. George stands outside the door with the capsules in his hand. Gower talking on the telephone. George stands in the doorway. He hangs up the phone and turns to George. He grabs George by the shirt and drags him into the back room. Gower starts hitting George about the head with his open hands. Mary is still seated at the soda fountain. Each time she hears George being slapped, she winces. George tries to protect himself as best he can. George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. George pulls the little box out of his pocket. Gower savagely rips it away from him, breathing heavily, staring at the boy venomously. He tears open the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at George again. The boy is whimpering, hurt, frightened. Gower steps toward him. But this time Gower sweeps the boy to him in a hug and, sobbing hoarsely, crushes the boy in his embrace. George is crying too. Across the counter stands Joe Hepner, the proprietor of the store he is showing a suitcase.",
    "209": "She screams. The noise is cut off by the swinging door. George and his mother sit down at the table. Harry, as he sticks his head through the kitchen door. She follows Harry into the kitchen, leaving Pop and George. George and his father, eating at the table. There is a great similarity and a great understanding between them. Harry and his mother come out of the kitchen, Harry carrying a pie in each hand and balancing one on his head. CAMERA PANS WITH them as they cross. George and Pop at the table. Annie comes in with some dishes. She exits. Annie comes in again from the kitchen. Annie stops serving to hear his answer. She gives George a look, and goes on out into the kitchen. Bailey smiles and turns to George. He stops, realizing that he has hurt his father. To cover his embarrassment, he looks toward the kitchen door and calls Annie listening through glass in door. George and his father at the table. At one end of the room an orchestra is playing. George wends his way through the dancing couples toward a supper table. He and Harry are carrying plates and pies. Several of the boys take the plates from him. George looks at them, feeling very grown up and out of place. Sam Wainwright comes in behind Harry, waggles his hands at his ears as he talks. George swings around, delighted to hear a familiar voice. Sam is assured and breezy, wearing very collegiate clothes. George and Sam wiggle their fingers at their ears, saluting each other. An elderly, fussy school principal comes over to George. Violet Bick comes into the scene and turns to face George. She is waving her dance program at him. Marty Hatch enters scene. He stops suddenly as he sees Mary, staring at her. She is standing talking to one of the boys, Freddie, a glass of punch in her hand. She turns around and for the first time she sees George. For a second she loses her poise, staring at him. George, staring at Mary. Still staring at George, and smiling. Mary and Freddie. Marty comes into scene, followed by George. Mary hands her punch cup to Freddie, and she and George start dancing. Following George and Mary as they dance. A WHISTLE is heard offscreen, and the MUSIC stops. Harry on the orchestra platform, whistle in hand. As the MUSIC starts and couples begin dancing once more, they look at each other. They start their Charleston. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of various couples doing their routines, some good, some bad. Freddie needs no more. Leaning against the railing around the dance floor, looking daggers at George.",
    "210": "Mickey, a young punk who has had one too many, is beside him. He takes the key from Mickey and turns the switch. The floor begins to part in the middle, each half sliding under the bleacher seats. Pandemonium starts. Dancers begin to scream as they try to get off. Some are so engrossed in dancing they continue at top speed. Teachers and elders start to scurry off. George and Mary dancing. They mistake the screams for cheers. George and Mary are so busy dancing they don't notice the floor opening. As the floor opens, it reveals an attractive, lighted swimming pool. Spotlights concentrate on them. The crowd watching George and Mary dancing. They move backwards until finally they reach the edge of the floor and fall into the pool below. George and Mary still trying to dance in the water the crowd on the edge cheering them some of the crowd leap into the pool the principal trying to restore order, finally clasps his hands like a diver and leaps in himself. The night is warm with a bright moon. George is dressed in jersey sweater and oversize football pants that keep wanting to come down. Mary is in an old white bath robe. Each is carrying their wet clothes tied into a bundle that leaves a trail of dripping water. As they near the camera we hear them singing. CAMERA MOVES WITH them as they proceed down the street. He takes the bundle of clothes from Mary. They stop and look at each other. Mary stops. George, to cover his embarrassment, talks quickly on. In his confusion George steps on the end of the belt of Mary's bath robe, which is trailing along behind her. She gathers the robe around her. He picks up the belt and throws it over her arm. George looks after her; then picks up a rock from the street. It is a weather-beaten, old-fashioned two-storied house that once was no doubt resplendent. George hurls the rock at the house. We see a grumpy old man in shirt sleeves in a rocking chair on the porch. He looks up as he hears the breaking glass. As he talks, Mary has been listening intently. She finally stoops down and picks up a rock, weighting it in her hand. The old deserted house. Mary throws her rock, and once more we hear the SOUND of breaking glass. Mary looks at him provocatively, then turns and shuffles off down the street, singing as she goes. George hurries after her. George joins her in the singing as they proceed down the street. Man on the porch of house, listening to George and Mary. They have stopped walking and now face one another.",
    "212": "The whistle of the approaching train is heard. The train comes to a stop, and Harry is among the first to get off, followed by an attractive girl about the same age as he is. The group, including Ruth Dakin. This is the young lady who came off the train with Harry. In the excitement of greetings she has been momentarily forgotten. She stands, smiling, waiting. George and Uncle Billy stare, astounded. George is thunderstruck. He takes Ruth's hand. He kisses Ruth. Camera moves with them down the platform. George stops, with a sinking feeling. Uncle Billy and Ruth continue out of shot. Harry stops with George. He runs out of the shot, George watching him. George slowly moves after Uncle Billy and Ruth. He is thinking deeply. Camera moves with George as he comes into the scene. Ruth detaches herself from the group and offers George some popcorn. Ruth nods, smiling. Cousin Eustace is taking a photograph of the family group assembled on the porch. Flash bulbs go off, and the group breaks up. The crowd enters the front door of the house, leaving George and Uncle Billy on the porch. The latter is tipsy. He feels very high. He looks around for his hat, which is on his head. George takes the hat from Uncle Billy's head and hands it to him. They descend the porch steps, and George turns his uncle around and heads him down the street. George is standing at the garden gate. He is obviously disturbed about the latest turn of events. He takes some travel folders from his pocket, looks at them and throws them away. His mother comes out of the house and kisses him. She nods toward the house, where Harry and Ruth, among a crowd of other couples, are dancing to the music of a phonograph, and can be seen through the front door. They kiss. Mrs. Bailey puts George's hat on his head. George is standing in the middle of the street, hands in his pockets. He is obviously undecided as to what he wants to do. As a girl passes, he turns and watches her for a moment. Violet is locking up for the night. A couple of men are crowding around her, each one bent on taking her out. She looks up and sees George standing there. Camera pans with Violet as she crosses the street to George. Violet takes her beauty shop seriously and she's an eyeful. He looks her over. She senses the fact that George is far from immune to her attractions. She links her arm in his and continues on down the street with him. They stop walking and face one another. Her eyes are seductive and guileful as she looks up at him.",
    "213": "George is walking slowly past the Hatch home. He walks past the house a few yards, turns, and starts back again. Mary is looking out the window, watching George walk back and forth. But after a few steps he turns around and starts back. George stops, startled, and looks up. Mary has disappeared from the window. Mary is running down the stairs. Mary looks in a mirror at the bottom of the stairs and fixes her hair. She is plainly excited at George's visit. She runs into the parlor and puts a sketch on an easel. It is a caricature of George throwing a lasso around the moon. Then she opens the front door and stands there waiting for George. George is struggling with the gate he finally kicks it open and starts slowly up the path toward Mary. Mary and George are in the entrance hall. They go through the doorway into the parlor. George sees the cartoon on the easel and bends down for a close look at it. George and Mary sitting on the divan. There is silence for a moment, then Mary joins in singing with the phonograph record which has been playing all through the above scene. He looks at his watch, as though about to leave. He is uncomfortable, and she tries desperately to keep the conversation alive. Mrs. Hatch, in a bathrobe, and with her hair in curlers, is leaning over the banister as she calls. George and Mary seated on the divan. George is aghast. As George leaves the room, the telephone in the hall starts ringing. Mary comes into the hall. As Mary picks up the phone, George comes in from the front porch. George has stopped, hat in hand, to hear the first greetings. She hands the instrument to George. Sam is seated at his desk, while a couple of his friends are nearby, with highballs in their hands. As she hears this, she hastily hangs up the extension phone on which she has been listening. Mary takes the telephone from George and holds it so that of necessity George's cheek is almost against hers. He is very conscious of her proximity. Mary is watching George interestedly. George is very conscious of her, close to him. As Mary listens, she turns to look at George, her lips almost on his lips. George can stand it no longer. He is silent for a moment, then blurts out. By this time a small crowd has collected to watch the above scene. Violet is furious and talking in a loud voice, and George is trying to quiet her. As George stalks off, the crowd breaks into laughter. George looks surprised at this.",
    "217": "Pappy is considering the crowd. He drops one arm around Everett, the other around Delmar. Everett hesitates, not sure where this is going. The band beams, but Delmar leans into Everett, worried. He gives Everett a meaningful look, which Everett holds for a considering beat. Pappy returns a considered appraisal. The steps of the meeting hall. People stream out of the concert into the warm summer night. Everett, now relieved of his beard, is walking down the steps with Penny. He raises Penny's left hand with his own to display their wedding bands - but Penny's finger is bare. She walks off. His attention, and everyone else's, is drawn by a procession on the street below. A crowd carrying torches jogs behind a man in clanking leg irons and wrist manacles who is being escorted by four policemen trotting alongside, their nightsticks held across their chests in riot-ready formation. Everett and the rest of the Soggy Bottom Boys descend the last couple of steps to meet the oncoming criminal. Delmar cries out. It is indeed George Nelson, grinning and game despite his heavy restraints. As he passes he turns to call back over his shoulder. Delmar, smiling, shakes his head as he watches him go. In the black we hear snuffling, growing louder, closer, slobberier. We are inside a cupboard. Its door is being nosed open by an eagerly sniffing snout. As the door swings wide the inside of the cupboard is washed with light. It contains, next to a tangled bunch of hairnets, several neatly stacked tins of Dapper Dan pomade. Everett, Pete, Delmar and Tommy are walking through the woods. They emerge into a clearing. The cabin stands before them. Two shotgun-wielding goons fall in behind the four men and push them forward. Moving forward reveals, next to the oak tree, three fresh-dug graves. Standing at the far lip of each grave is a rough pine coffin. The sheriff with mirrored sunglasses, Cooley, steps off the porch, the drooling hound at his heels. The goons are shoving them toward the tree. Three gravediggers, having just finished their work, emerge from the three graves. They are shirtless black men with bandannas round their necks. They look to Cooley for guidance. So too does the drooling hound. The goons recover their leering grins and resume their happy task. The gravediggers stand next to the graves, leaning on their shovels. Sweat glistens on them and trickles down their faces like tears. Cooley gives the faintest smile. Delmar bows his head to silently pray. Everett bows his head as well. The singing of the gravediggers begins a mournful swell. The mournfully building song is now supported by a bass more palpable than audible - the song, it seems, rising out of the earth itself.",
    "220": "Delmar whistles appreciatively. He lurches threateningly to his feet. Everett scrambles up. Everett too watches the white-robed people following in the wake of the tenor. There are more and more white robes drifting through the woods, all of them strangely oblivious to the three men. There is an endless stream now, drifting through the foreground, the background, the campsite itself. We are booming down to reveal a minister in the foreground. He stands belly-deep in the river, easing a white-robed man back-down into the water. Behind him a line of robed singers lengthens steadily as people stream out of the woods. Pete, Delmar and Everett emerge from the woods and gaze down at the river. White-robed people continue to drift past them. Delmar wades out into the stream, cutting in line. Delmar has reached the minister and holds his nose as the minister incantates over him and lowers him into the water. The smoldering twig fire. A bloodhound on a leash circles into frame, its tail fiercely wagging. We follow it as, nose to the ground and straining against its leash, it waddles over to an empty tin of Dapper Dan pomade. Everett drives, shaking his head with a forebearing smile. Pete, sitting next to him, and Delmar, in back, are both dripping wet. He shakes his head and laughs. A thirtyish black man in worn go-to-meetin' clothes stands on the shoulder, waggling his thumb at the passing car. He grabs his battered guitar case as the car pulls over and trots up to the open window. Everett looks at the man in the rearview mirror as he pulls out. Tommy shrugs. Everett's eyes narrow as he studies the man in the rearview. The car is pulling into the parking lot of a single-story cement-block building with a hundred-foot antenna and a handpainted sign. As the men get out of the car, Everett snaps his suspenders. Everett strides up to a portly middle-aged man who wears dark glasses and holds a white cane. Everett grimaces, thinking. The three singing convicts form a semi-circle behind Tommy, who plays his guitar into a can microphone. They are performing a hot and harmonized version of 'Man of Constant Sorrow'. When they finish Everett whoops and slaps Tommy on the back. A caravan of two oversize cars is pulling into the lot just as Tommy and the three convicts burst out of the station door, whooping it up. A sixty-year-old man in enormous seersucker pants held up by suspenders and the outward pressure of a blooming belly is getting out of the first car. Delmar waves a fistful of money at him. A big shambling man of about thirty has followed him out of the car.",
    "224": "Everett gives her an ingratiating laugh. He ostentatiously fans some of his money. Watching Everett fan his money. The big man stops chewing and slowly raises his napkin to his lips to give them a dainty pat. The big man appears as she leaves. Big Dan chuckles as he draws up a chair. Everett rises and digs in his pocket. As the three men start to move off, Big Dan gives Delmar a tilt of the head and a crinkling smile. Pappy O'Daniel sits smoking a cigar, nursing a glass of whiskey, and soliciting the counsel of his overweight retinue. Pappy narrows his eyes at him, wondering what he's getting at. Pappy whips off his hat and slaps at Junior with it. He glares around the table. Eckard grunts as he starts to rise. Pappy whips him back down with his hat. As he settles back Eckard looks around the table and helpfully relays. The car boosted from the general store has been pulled off the road and parked a few yards into a field littered with bluebonnets and rimmed with moss-dripping oak. Everett, Delmar and Big Dan sit on a blanket around a large picnic hamper. Big Dan is just sucking the last piece of chicken off a bone. He tosses the bone over his shoulder, belches, and sighs. Delmar is pleased and embarrassed. He rises to his feet and tosses down his napkin. He reaches up and with one hand easily rips a stout limb off a tree. He casually strips its twigs. He swings at Delmar who staggers back with a grunt. Everett wears a puzzled smile. Delmar, though stunned, is faster to size things up. He charges Big Dan and wraps his arms around him. Big Dan rears back and whacks at his head. Everett is still puzzled, but willing to be instructed. Big Dan walks awkwardly over to Everett with Delmar still attached to him like a hunting dog locked on to a bear. Big Dan takes a break from whacking at Delmar to deliver a blow to Everett. The blow catches Everett on the chin and sends him reeling. Big Dan bear hugs Delmar and tosses him away. He whacks Everett into a semi-conscious heap and then paws through his pockets. He walks over to Delmar who is on the ground moaning, and kicks him several times. He takes Delmar's shoebox and flips off the top. Inside is a bed of straw with the toad resting on it. He pokes around the straw with his finger; nothing else inside. Delmar, moaning, looks blearily up through swollen eyes. Big Dan has the toad in his enormous fist. Delmar moans through cracked and bloody lips. He squeezes the frog, crushing it, and tosses it away against a tree.",
    "228": "Furniture, torn mattresses and pillows lie scattered. Feathers fly. Szpilman comes into the courtyard. He turns a corner. He stops, his face blank. Lying outside the door, the bodies of Jehuda, Mrs. Zyskind, their two sons and the toddler. Szpilman steps across the bodies. Papers, pamphlets strewn all over the place. The mimeograph smashed. Szpilman enters, stands, surveying the devastation. Szpilman shuffles along, comes to the cafe. He goes inside. A shambles. Szpilman wanders through the upturned tables, broken chairs. Stops, looks about. He turns and makes for the door. Then he hears an urgent hiss. He turns sharply and tries to find the source of it. Now he sees, hiding under the platform, Benek, beckoning to him. Szpilman hurries over and crawls on his back until he's beside him. Benek replaces a plank and they are hidden from view. Thin slivers of light illuminate the two men on their backs in the cramped space. He can't continue. Benek nods. In bright sun, Szpilman and Benek march in a column, four abreast, under the command of two Jewish foremen, guarded by two German policemen. They are being marched out of the ghetto gates. Street traders with baskets full of wares, fruit, vegetables, fish, tins of preserves. Women bargain with them, making purchases. Lively, colourful. Dealers in gold and currency calling monotonously. Again Szpilman tries, but Janina, her profile to him, doesn't see. He goes back to work. The German policemen wander over to one of the stalls to buy fruit. The moment they do so two Jewish workers scamper across to another stall to buy bread. Szpilman glances across the square: Janina is still at the stall. He comes to a decision. He jumps down, is about to dash towards Janina, but stops dead. Janina is no longer there. As before, Szpilman and Benek march towards the ghetto gates in the demolition column, four abreast, under the command of the Jewish foremen and guarded by the two German policemen. A little later: Szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back. The noise of airplanes overhead. A swarm of Russian bombers. Anti-aircraft fire. Puffs of exploding shells. The workers look up. So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below. An SS man, ZICK-ZACK (his nickname), with a whip, approaches Szpilman. Szpilman goes to him. Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly. After a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied. Two Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag him away. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood, nails, tools, paint, metal brackets.",
    "230": "A gentle knock on the door and Bogucki slips in with some clothes. He gazes at Szpilman, whose eyes remain closed. Bogucki holds up a towel. Szpilman lifts himself out of the bath and dries himself. The ceramic stove. Szpilman's ghetto clothes, torn into strips, are being stuffed into it and burned. Janina shoves the strips of clothes into the stove. Szpilman, now wearing Bogucki's suit and clean-shaven, watches the clothes burn while he spoons hot soup into his mouth. Janina adds the last strip of clothing. A rickshaw carrying Szpilman and Bogucki travels along the dark streets. The rickshaw comes to a halt outside a store. The moment it stops the shutters of the store are raised and Bogucki escorts Szpilman to the door, then quickly returns to the rickshaw, which moves off fast. GEBCZNYSKI shakes hands with Szpilman, ushers him in and then pulls down the shutter. Gebczynski's store is for sanitary furnishings and supplies: lavatories, basins, baths, taps etc. He leads the way and as he goes he picks up a cushion from a chair and a blanket. Szpilman follows. Gebczynski leads Szpilman down the stairs. Dark, shadowy. Shelves with taps, washers, pipes. Gebczynski leads the may to a particular set of shelves. He puts aside the cushion and blanket, then starts to push at the shelves. Slowly, the shelves move to reveal a secret compartment. He helps Szpilman into the compartment. He hands over the cushion and the blanket to Szpilman; then, putting his back to the shelves and his feet against the wall, he pushes the shelves back into place so that Szpilman is now hidden. In the cramped space, Szpilman is not quite able to stretch full out. With difficulty, he puts the cushion behind his head, starts to cover himself with the blanket but stops, seeing something. Szpilman and Gebczynski wait with others at the stop as the tram trundles towards them and comes to a halt. As they board. Gebczynski and Szpilman apprehensive, push through the rear section, packed with Poles, seated and standing, until they reach a chain and a sign. In the German section, only three or four passengers. Some read newspapers, others stare into space or out of the windows, but never looking at the Poles. Szpilman tries to appear as inconspicuous as possible. The tram rumbles on its way. Gebczynski and Szpilman come up the stairs to the landing and to a door. Gebczynski unlocks the door and they go in. A charmingly furnished bed-sitting room with a comfortable divan. Gebczynski leads the way in. Szpilman glances around, goes to the window, looks out. He can see a section of ghetto wall below. Beyond it, inside the ghetto, a narrow street leading to deserted buildings.",
    "233": "Michal carries a bag of provisions and puts them on a table while Szpilman goes immediately to the window and looks out. There are views of the city, but in the street below, opposite, is a hospital and, on the corner, a building flying a Nazi flag and guarded by a sentry, standing at his sentry-box. Michal comes up behind Szpilman. Michal makes for the door. He nods and goes. The sound of the padlock closing. Szpilman takes in the room. He sees the piano, is still for a moment, then goes to it. He sits on the piano stool and adjusts its height. He opens the lid. A cloth covers the keys. He removes the cloth. He gazes lovingly at the keyboard. He flexes his fingers. Then, without touching the keys, his fingers floating just above them, he plays. Passionately. Snow falling. Szpilman alert, hearing the padlock being unlocked and then idle. The door opens and Michal enters, accompanied by a man, aged about thirty, Szalas, confident, a little brash. In whispers. Szalas and Szpilman shake hands. Szalas produces a quarter bottle of vodka, thumps the back of the bottle so that the cork flies out. He finds glasses and pours. He gives the others their vodka. Szalas shrugs, finds the vodka, pours two glasses. He unwraps the package to reveal sausage and bread. He takes a bite of sausage, chewing deliberately, slowly. Szalas goes to the window, looks out. Szpilman thinks for a moment, then takes off his wristwatch, hands it to Szalas. Szalas pockets the watch, makes for the door, stops. He grins, downs Szpilman's vodka, gives a mock salute and goes. The padlock is locked on the other side. Sunshine floods in through the windows. Szpilman lies inert on the bed, weak, starving, ill. The sound of the padlock. Dorota, no longer pregnant, and Michal enter, come to the bed. In whispers. Szpilman barely has strength to open his eyes and focus on them. He mutters incoherently. She starts for the door. He leaves. The padlock sound. Dorota goes to the kitchen, wets a towel, comes back to the bed, kneels it, places the towel on Szpilman's brow. He focuses on her, smiles. Szpilman suddenly winces with pain. She looks at him; barely audible. The Doctor and Michal leave his line of vision. Szpilman looking down from the fourth-floor window. Peaceful. A few pedestrians. An everyday atmosphere. At the far end, at the T-junction with a main road, a tram rumbles down the street and comes to a halt, disgorging passengers on the far side and so out of sight. The tram continues on its way, now revealing the few passengers who alighted, two women, an old man with a stick.",
    "24": "Carol enters the scene. Wide-eyed with apprehension, she looks at her mother, who, in return, only nods permission for Carol to let it go. A last defiant snort from Carol -- and then she is overwhelmed. Carol breathes heavily -- gets control, stopping herself on the brink of crying. Slumped, fought out -- Carol gets out one last, naked husky voiced question. A beat, then. She offers him the note. He hands it back to her deliberately. She takes it and walks back to the service area where, embarrassed, confused, and messed with -- she tosses the note. After Carol leaves, she exits. Carol takes an old weekend case down from the top shelf of the closet. Now she looks in another drawer and pauses as if she ponders one of the mysteries of the ages. She hesitates then talks to herself. She puts it back. Carol puts her bag in the car. And off they go. Turning onto Fifth. Carol chattering away. Simon and Carol have thus declared their majority. Carol, whose life has been rugged but basic, feels as strange as she does moved by Simon's trauma which is so much more complicated than her meat and potatoes troubles. She looks out her window -- then kisses her fingers and touches them to Simon's cheek. A nice, understated, gesture of friendship. Carol walks to Simon and puts an arm on him. She gives Simon a kiss. She turns to him. She exits the room. Melvin is in his bedroom -- everything he's taking neatly stacked on the bed waiting to be packed (he is taking a camera). He has a list of what he needs. All items underwear, socks, etc. with four checks next to each one and still he -- checks each stack on the bed and adds another check. The PHONE RINGS. He makes a little comment to himself as he moves. This is an amazing development. He has almost no recent experience with receiving a nighttime phone call. As she picks up the phone. Melvin visibly relaxes. Melvin looks up -- wary -- his brain sends a disturbing message. And finally Carol notes Melvin's mood and pauses. She looks at him for a very strange, long beat. Melvin is visibly disturbed by her gesture. Melvin unnerved. Frank prepares to depart. Frank starts to leave -- Simon stops him. They embrace. As Frank moves off Melvin sees Carol and his demeanor changes. Frank stumbles back. Self-satisfied, he relaxes. Frank adjusts and exits. Simon and Carol stunned by the manners. CAMERA FOLLOWS as Melvin goes to a rack of CDs -- all carefully labelled. As Carol, dressed in a thrift shop find, enters the main room of the suite and hears the SHOWER running -- she sits down to wait -- through.",
    "240": "He starts to scale a wall. He looks as though he's getting away. But there's a floodlight on the SS vehicle. It flares into light, swivels and finds the man. A volley of shots. The man drops from the wall, dead. The SS men get into the vehicle and speed off, driving over the dead bodies. Szpilman and Henryk stare at the scene, silent, shocked. The only sounds, the weeping of the people opposite and, nearer, Mother crying softly. Szpilman, as if in another world, playing the piano. The cafe is full of customers but the atmosphere is much more subdued than previously, the mood is sombre. A doorman with a cudgel beats away the beggars from the door as Halina, distraught and out of breath, runs to the cafe entrance. The doorman lets her in. Szpilman snaps out of his reverie, seeing, across the heads of the customers, Halina, in a state of great anxiety, beckoning urgently. Szpilman quickly brings the piece to a close, stands, steps off the platform, threads his way through to Halina. She's shivering, almost unable to speak. Szpilman running. Streets crowded. Corpses. Szpilman, sweating, dodges and sidesteps. Then, suddenly, a woman bars his way. She's the Feather Woman, brightly rouged, with her thickly painted eyebrows, the unsteady mauve ostrich feather rising from her straw hat. He tries to dodge past but she grabs his arm. Szpilman manages to free himself and runs on. A mob of men in front of the building being herded this way and that by Jewish policemen. More and more captive men are brought in by the German Schutzpolizei (Shupos). The mob constantly swelling. Szpilman reaches the back of the crowd. Szpilman scans the mob. The Jewish policemen using batons and whips to herd the men. Szpilman becomes alert. He's seen someone he recognises. Heller, with his red hair and Hitler moustache, wielding a baton, driving men into the building. With difficulty, Szpilman pushes his way through the mob and gets nearer to Heller. Heller glances round. Heller shoves someone aside so that Szpilman can approach, but he continues to beat and manhandle people. Heller just glares at Szpilman and then moves away. Szpilman stands, jostled by the crowd, uncertain, forlorn. Szpilman, keeping to the shadows of the alleyway, watches the front of the building. Comings and goings. German Soldiers in evidence. The mob is smaller now. Szpilman waits and watches, and then a POOR WOMAN passes, carrying a can wrapped in newspaper followed by a RAGGED OLD MAN, dragging himself along. He's shivering with cold, his shoes with holes show his purple feet. The ragged old man suddenly lunges forward and tries to grab the can from the poor woman.",
    "249": "She touches its sleeve. Her hand goes in its pocket and pulls out his tobacco pouch. Like a little girl playing cowboy, she spreads the tobacco on some rolling paper. Imitating what he did earlier, she licks the paper and rolls it into a pretty good cigarette. Her hand reaches back in the pocket and pulls out his Zippo lighter. She SLAPS the lighter against her leg, trying to light it fancy-style like Vince did. What do you know, she did it! Mia's one happy clam. She triumphantly brings the fat flame up to her fat smoke, lighting it up, then LOUDLY SNAPS the Zippo closed. The Mia-made cigarette is brought up to her lips, and she takes a long, cool drag. Her hand slides the Zippo back in the overcoat pocket. But wait, her fingers touch something else. Those fingers bring out a plastic bag with white powder inside, the madman that Vincent bought earlier from Lance. Wearing a big smile, Mia brings the bag of heroin up to her face. Mia has the unbeknownst-to-her heroin cut up into big lines on her glass top coffee table. Taking her trusty hundred dollar bill like a human Dust-Buster, she quickly snorts the fat line. Her head JERKS back. Her hands go to her nose (which feels like it's on fucking fire), something is terribly wrong. Vincent dries his hands on a towel while he continues his dialogue with the mirror. Mia is on all fours trying to crawl to the bathroom, but it's like she's trying to crawl with the bones removed from her knees. Blood begins to drip from Mia's nose. Then her stomach gets into the act and she VOMITS. Vince continues. Blood and puke are down her front. And her face is contorted. Slack-jawed. Lance puts down his cereal and makes his way to the phone. Jody, his wife, CALLS from the bedroom, obviously woken up. Lance CHARGES from the window, out the door to his front lawn. Vincent is already out of the car, working on getting Mia out. WE START in Lance's and Jody's bedroom. Jody, in bed, throws off the covers and stands up. She's wearing a long tee-shirt with a picture of Fred Flintstone on it. As she walks in the living room, she sees Vincent and Lance standing over Mia, who's lying on the floor in the middle of the room. From here on in, everything in this scene is frantic, like a DOCUMENTARY in an emergency ward, with the big difference here being nobody knows what the fuck they're doing. Lance looks up at Jody. WE FOLLOW Lance as he runs out of the living room into a room with a bunch of junk in it.",
    "250": "Lance continues his frenzied search. Jody calls to Lance. As he continues searching, flipping and knocking over shit, Jody appears in the doorway. Lance spins toward her. Lance angrily knocks over a pile of shit and leaves the shot heading for the living room. Vincent is bent over Mia, talking softly to her, when Lance reenters the room. Lance bends down by the black case brought in by Jody. He opens it and begins preparing the needle for injection. Vince rips her blouse open. Jody stumbles back in the room, hanging back from the action. Vince points to Mia's right breast. Lance glances over and nods. As Lance readies the injection, Vincent looks up at Jody. Jody runs to the desk, opens the top drawer and, in her enthusiasm, she pulls the drawer out of the desk, the contents of which (bills, papers, pens) spill to the floor. The injection is ready. Lance hands Vincent the needle. Jody hurriedly joins them in the huddle, a big fat red magic marker in her hand. Vincent grabs the magic marker out of Jody's hand and makes a big red dot on Mia's body where her heart is. Then once you do, push down on the plunger. Vincent lifts the needle up above his head in a stabbing motion. He looks down on Mia. Mia is fading fast. Vincent's eyes narrow, ready to do this. Lance, on his knees right beside Vincent, does not know what to expect. Red dot on Mia's body. Needle raised ready to strike. Jody's face is alive with anticipation. Needle in the air, poised like a rattler ready to strike. The needle leaves frame, thrusting down hard. Vincent brings the needle down hard, stabbing Mia in the chest. Mia's head is jolted from the impact. The syringe plunger is pushed down, pumping the adrenaline out through the needle. Mia's eyes pop wide open and she lets out a hellish cry of the banshee. She bolts up in a sitting position, needle stuck in her chest screaming. Vincent, Lance and Jody, who were in sitting positions in front of Mia, jump back, scared to death. Mia's scream runs out. She slowly starts taking breaths of air. The other three, now scooted halfway across the room, shaken to their bones, look to see if she's alright. Mia, still breathing, not looking up at them, says in a relatively normal voice. She turns around. Vincent's out of the car, standing on the walkway, a big distance between the two. Mia smiles. The two walk toward each other, holding out their hands to shake and shake they do. Mia lets go of Vincent's hand and silently makes the see-no-evil, hear-no-evil, and speak-no-evil sign with her hands.",
    "251": "We're in the living room of a modest two bedroom house in Alhambra, California, in the year 1972. BUTCH'S MOTHER, 35ish, stands in the doorway leading into the living room. Next to her is a man dressed in the uniform of an American Air Force officer. The CAMERA is the perspective of a five-year old boy. KOONS steps inside the room toward the little boy and bends down on one knee to bring him even with the boy's eyeline. When Koons speaks, he speaks with a slight Texas accent. The Captain pulls a gold wrist watch out of his pocket. Koons hands the watch to Butch. A little hand comes into FRAME to accept it. The 27-year old Butch Coolidge is dressed in boxing regalia: trunks, shoes and gloves. He lies on a table catching a few zzzzzz's before his big fight. Almost as soon as WE CUT to him, he wakes up with a start. Shaken by the bizarre memory, he wipes his sweaty face with his boxing glove. His trainer KLONDIKE, an older fireplug, opens the door a little, sticking his head in the room. Pandemonium seems to be breaking out behind Klondike in the hallway. A taxi is parked in a dark alley next to an auditorium. WE SLOWLY DOLLY toward the parked car. The SOUND of the CAR RADIO can be heard coming from inside. A young woman, with Spanish looks, sits parked, drinking a steaming hot cup of coffee out of a white styrofoam cup. The Sportscasters continue their coverage. CLICK Esmarelda shuts off the radio. She takes a sip of coffee, then hears a NOISE behind her in the alley. She sticks her head out of the car door to see. A window about three stories high opens on the auditorium- side of the alley. A gym bag is tossed out into a garbage dumpster below the window. Then, Butch Coolidge, still dressed in boxing trunks, shoes, gloves and yellow robe, LEAPS to the dumpster below. ESMARELDA'S REACTION takes in the strangeness of this sight. Butch, soaking wet, naked except for trunks, shoes and gloves, HOPS in the backseat, SLAMMING the door. Esmarelda, staring straight ahead, talks to Butch through the rearview mirror. Butch gets one of his boxing gloves off. Esmeralda watches in the rearview mirror. She presses a button and the back window moves down. Butch tosses his boxing glove out the window, then starts untying the other one. Esmeralda can't keep quiet anymore. As he tosses his other glove out the window. He finished wiping himself down. He tosses the towel out the window. Silence, as Butch digs in his bag for a t-shirt. Vincent smiles. Mia giggles. Vincent turns around.",
    "252": "Butch pulls on his tee-shirt. Esmarelda bounces in her seat with excitement. He looks at her license. We DOLLY around a phone booth as Butch talks inside. Butch hangs up the phone. Butch holds up a hundred dollar bill. Esmarelda's eyes light up. She goes to take it. Butch holds it for sometime. He gives her the bill. Butch flicks the switch back, making the room dark again. Butch climbs into bed, spooning Fabienne from behind. When Butch and Fabienne speak to each other, they speak in babytalk. Fabienne rolls over and Butch gets on top of her. They kiss. Butch's hand goes out of frame and starts massaging her crotch. Fabienne reacts. Fabienne lies her head back. Butch continues to massage her crotch. Butch kisses her on the mouth. Butch's head goes down out of frame to carry out the oral pleasure. Fabienne's face is alone in the frame. She finishes drying her hair and wraps the towel like a turban on her head. She hands him a towel. Butch exits the bathroom. We stay on Fabienne as she brushes her teeth. Butch keeps on talking from the other room. Fabienne brushes her teeth. We watch her for a moment or two, then she remember something. She walks out of the bathroom to ask Butch a question, only to find him sound asleep in bed. She looks at him for a moment. Butch squints down the front of the bed at her, trying to focus. Fabienne enters the room. Fabienne laughs. Fabienne gives Butch a sweet long kiss. Butch climbs out of bed and starts pulling clothes out of the suitcase that Fabienne brought. Butch is finished dressing. As he goes through the suitcase. By now, Butch is frantically rummaging through the suitcase. He's now throwing clothes. Fabienne can hardly speak, she's never seen Butch this way. Fabienne is crying and scared. Butch lowers his voice, which only serves to make him more menacing. He bends down in front of the woman who has sunk to the floor. Then rises. Fabienne is still sniffling. Butch goes to the closet. Butch puts on his high school jacket. Rising from the floor. The little Honda races toward its destination as fast as is little engine will take it. He has parked his car a couple of blocks from his apartment to check things out before he goes boppin' through the front door. Butch walks down the alley until he gets to another street, then he discreetly glances out. Everything seems normal. More or less the right number of cars in the street. None of the parked cars appear out of place. Basically, it looks like normal morning activity in front of Butch's home.",
    "255": "A disheveled young man in a gaily colored Hawaiian shirt is launched into frame by someone offscreen. The hatch marks on the wall behind him are apparently height markers. As his picture is taken, it is mounted on a tripod. A pretty young woman in a severe police uniform peers out from behind it. HI obliges, but still looks at Ed out of the corner of his eye. On his eye-skewed profile, as Hi is escorted away from the camera toward his cell. At the far end of the corridor a huge con is sluggishly mopping the floor. The Mopping Con snarls as Hi passes. Panning a circle of men who sit facing each other in folding chairs, the pan starts on Hi. At this point the pan has reached the COUNSELOR, an earnest, bearded young man who straddles a folding chair with his arms folded over its back. He is addressing one of the Cons. The huge muscle-bound black man with a shaved head is knitting his brow in consternation. Three PAROLE OFFICERS - two men and a woman - face Hi across a table. A beat-up Chevy pulls into the all-night store's empty parking lot. Hi is getting out of the Chevy in a Hawaiian shirt, holding a pump-action shotgun. He primes the shotgun - WHOOSH - CLACK - and heads for the store. Full-face exposure of Hi once again in front of the mug-shot wall. Hi obliges but shoots sympathetic glances at Ed who is obviously upset, wiping away tears and snuffling behind the camera. On Hi's profile, he turns back to Ed. Looking up through her tears as Hi is led away, as another police officer starts to lead him away. Struggling to call back over his shoulder as he is firmly led out the door, the door slams. As Hi is once again escorted toward his cell, the Mopping Con is now in the middle-background, having worked his way about halfway up the corridor since last time we saw him. As Hi passes, Hi looks sheepish. Two convicts sitting next to each other, GALE and EVELLE, appear to be friends. Hi faces the same three PAROLE OFFICERS across the same table. Of a 7-Eleven parking lot, at night, deserted except for Hi's car which sits untended, its engine rumbling. Hi backpedals into frame with a shotgun and a bag of cash. He spins and grabs his car-door handle. Locked. He tries the back door. Locked. As we hear the wail of an approaching siren, Hi takes it on the heel and toe. On Hi against the mug-shot wall, we see his right hand being efficiently manipulated by Ed's two hands: She is rolling each of his inked fingers into the appropriate space on an exemplar sheet.",
    "258": "At the same time the little Cashier is emerging from the 7-Eleven with his gun. The two bang away at Hi's retreating figure - the Policeman's revolver popping, the Cashier's Magnum booming. Huffing and puffing down the road with his Huggies. The cop car careens onto the street in the background, its siren wailing. The PASSENGER COP is leaning far out his window, one hand gripping the light-and-siren rack, the other pointing a gun at Hi, shooting away. Bullets whizz past. Suddenly, with a soft pthunk! the Huggies box pops forward, out from under Hi's arm - hit by a bullet. Still running, Hi reaches forward, tries to catch it on the fly, bobbles it, tips it - loses it. He overruns it a couple steps before he can bring himself up short. He turns and reaches to pick up the box but - PING-PING - bullets chew up the road near his hand. Leaving the Huggies, Hi takes off through a well-manicured yard. The police car is proceeding on down the street to catch him around the corner, the driver still drawling over his loudspeaker. We are tracking behind Hi as he runs up to the house and crashes through the screen door. Still tracking behind him as he runs through the living room. A middle-aged couple sits on the couch watching TV. They look up as Hi rushes by. Hi plunges down a staircase. As he does so we hear: ka-chick ka-chock ka-chick ka-chock. He emerges into a rec room where he and we rush past two kids playing ping-pong. He runs out the back door. OFFICER STEENSMA plunges down the stairs. Outdoors now, running, crossing the street behind the house and entering the parking lot of a supermarket on the other side. As a pack of dogs thunders in. The lead Doberman with chain and spike has now picked up about a dozen neighborhood dogs. The dogs thunder through the living room and down the stairs. As Hi bursts in. Tracking on him as he runs down the broad front aisle, head whipping as he runs, looking up each perpendicular lane, searching for something. He turns up one of the last lanes, races along it and grabs a carton of Huggies, still on the flat run. He emerges into the broad back aisle and runs along it, but at the first perpendicular lane he hits, we see Officer Steensma, gun leveled, at the other end. He fires. Hi keeps running. The Policeman is running along the front aisle, keeping pace with Hi running along the back aisle. He squeezes off shots at Hi as each lane gives him the opportunity. Hi abruptly stops between lanes and doubles back, losing the Policeman.",
    "259": "He runs down the second lane he comes to toward the front of the store. The pack of dogs appears at the end of the lane and thunders up toward Hi, braying at the top of their doggy lungs. The lead Doberman holds in his teeth a paper 7-Eleven cap. Hi reverses again, and emerges into the back aisle. BANG! A pyramid of cranberry juice explodes at his shoulder. Hi looks. Standing in the raised platform-cubicle at the front of the store is the Store Manager, a fat man in a white short-sleeved shirt with a lit cigarette dangling from his mouth. The Manager cracks open his shotgun and inserts two more cartridges - THOONK THOONK - in the smoking chamber. Hi doubles back once again toward the back aisle. The MANAGER is blowing out groceries on the shelves behind him. As he coolly levels his police special and takes aim at Hi. Still on the dead run, Hi is flinging the carton of Huggies. The carton rockets straight at the camera. Futilely raising his gun to avoid-impact: The Huggies catch him square on the chest. The force makes him stumble one fatal step backwards - into the back aisle - where: CRASH - He is hit broadside and bowled over by a rocketing shopping cart, propelled by an hysterically screaming SHOPPER. Racing on down the back aisle, bellowing. Tracking from in front. Beyond her we can see the pack of furiously barking dogs, nipping at her heels. As Hi emerges through the back door. Ed is just skidding around the corner. Hi scrambles in the passenger side. The car peels out of the lot. THWAK - Ed gives him a good hard slap and Hi's head rolls toward the camera. Hi's eyes are fixed on something in the road ahead. Hi's attention is still on the road. He is opening his door, even though the car is still racing along. He absently concedes. In the extreme foreground sits the first carton of Huggies that Hi dropped in the middle of the road. The car is approaching. As the car passes the carton, Hi's hand reaches from the passenger door and snags it. As Hi pulls the carton in and slams his door shut. Crane up in the car speeding away. As Ed bursts in the front door, holding Nathan Jr. They look up, dumbstruck and mortified, from the sofa where the have been watching TV. Ed is unmoved. She storms into the bedroom and slams the door. There is an awkward silence as Gale studies his thumb and Evelle stares at the ceiling. Finally Evelle turns to Hi. His gesture seems to take in the trailer and the entire domestic situation.",
    "261": "Similarly producing a long wooden match. Biting down on the cigar. Dragging the kitchen match along the unfinished wood surface of an expensive bureau, leaving an ugly black scar. The match erupts into roaring flame. Crackling as it is lit. From the inside of the office. The name on the pebbled glass is a backwards Nathan Arizona. There is the shadow of a man approaching the door, and muffled voices. The door swings open and Nathan stands looking in, his middle-aged secretary hanging at his elbow. Nathan is staring toward his desk. The Biker sits with his back to us, jackboots propped lazily on the desk. His head bobs and ducks, as if he is following some movement in the air in front of him. Eyes on the Biker he slams the door shut behind him, looking for some reaction. He still does not react to Nathan, not even bothering to give him a glance. His eyes continue to follow some phantom movement. When the Biker speaks it is still without looking at Nathan, and with a surprisingly soft voice and mild, unhurried manner. He takes a drag on his cigar. SMALLS is pleasantly shaking his head. Nathan is looking at him stonily. Quick as a flash the heretofore languid Smalls bolts forward, his fist stopped an inch short of Nathan's nose. His index finger and thumb are pinched together-holding the leg of a struggling fly that he has just plucked from the air. He flicks the fly away. Nathan stares grimly at Smalls. Nathan swivels to punch numbers on a telephone. He swivels back, looking up, and his speech stops short. The office is empty. A whipcrack effect builds to the cut and. He has been slumped over the kitchen table, asleep. Hi looks up. Gale and Evelle are smiling down at him. Hi takes the envelope that he was slumped over, to Ed written on its face. There is a harsh knock at the door. All three tense. Hi is staring. The knock comes again. He goes to the door, pulls back its shade and peeks out. Hi is looking at him evenly. Hi is suddenly nervous and urgent. Hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand. Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon. Hi stops short. Glen smiles. He spits on the dirt in front of him. Hi's face is set in rigid dismay. Glen is getting into his car. He slams the door. And the car squeals off. Hi looks back at the trailer. A slat in the window blind drops back into place. He opens the door. Evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms.",
    "263": "The rumble builds, louder and louder, until it is snapped off by a click. The front door handle clicks open and Smalls stands in the doorway. The abandoned trailer is perfectly quiet. The room is a complete shambles from the fight. Sunlight filters in between the slats of the venetian blinds. Smoke from Lenny Smalls' cheroot ripples up through the light. After only a momentary pause at the door to take in the scene, Smalls goes directly to a specific spot in the debris and nudges some of it aside with his toe, exposing a piece of paper. He bends down to pick it up but suddenly freezes, with a soft grunt of surprise. As he stands up with the piece of paper, it is Gale's picture of the Farmers and Mechanics Bank. Baking in the noonday sun, sitting in the front seat of their idling car, looking at the bank, they look at each other. Gale reaches for his door. As Gale and Evelle bang in through the door, Evelle holds a shotgun; Gale holds a shotgun in one hand and Nathan Jr. in his car seat in the other. Everyone freezes, staring at Gale and Evelle. An Old Hayseed with his hands in the air speaks up. There is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. Gale is tossing Evelle a sack. He is looking in shock at the tellers' counter. A muffled voice from offscreen. Evelle is momentarily abashed, but then brightens. Gale registers understanding. There is a murmur of acknowledgment from all the people on the ground. The camera is locked down on the roof of the rocketing squad car, looking past its flashing gumballs. The car is approaching the townlet, its siren wailing. A teller is finishing stuffing the last of two burlap bags. Close on her hands, we see her putting in a cash packet that is really only a few bills and a sleeve surrounding and hiding a small plastic device. The teller hits a button on the device and it starts ticking; she shoves it into the sack. He is grabbing the two sacks and tosses one to Gale, who also picks up the baby. As the two are backing toward the door, they bolt out the door. Siren jumps in loud at the cut. It is the same locked-down shot over the gumballs. Peeling out from in front of the bank, Gale is driving; Evelle starts pawing through one of the sacks. A thought registers with Gale and Evelle at the same moment. They look at each other. They both twist frantically to look in the back seat. Bellowing, KA-POP! With a loud flat crack something detonates in the front seat and the interior of the car is spattered with bright blue paint.",
    "265": "Hi and Ed are raising their heads. Facing forward, they do not see Lenny approaching again through the rear window. He is sawing out his second shotgun. Hi looks around, reaches and pulls Ed down beneath him just as: KA-BOOM! - The second shotgun roars and the back window spits in. As Lenny roars past the back window he casually flips something in. Folded over in the front seat. Below them something bounces into and around the leg well - Lenny's grenade. As the two front doors fly open and Hi and Ed spill out - Hi from the driver's side, heading for the far side of the road, and Ed from the passenger side. As she dives for cover behind a parked car. Beyond her - KABOOM! - their car explodes and bounces, pouring black smoke. The explosion flings him to the ground in the middle of the street. Looking up the street to where Lenny is wheeling his bike in a U-turn. He is not finished yet. Hi flat on his back, woozily shaking his head. He weakly raises himself on his elbows to look down the street. Looking down the length of his own body. His legs stretch away in a V. Crashing down from a wheelie, Lenny's roaring bike is almost upon him - aiming up the middle of the V. He rolls. As the bike is roaring by. Reaches and snags a chain on Lenny's passing boot. Dragged several yards before the boot shakes him off, leaving him on his stomach in the middle of the road. Hi looks up the road. Lenny is again sluing the bike around. Smoking as it skids around in the foreground, completing its turn. Boom up Lenny's back to reveal Ed stomping straight up the street toward him - unarmed, unafraid. As Ed closes in. Lenny's arms rise into frame. With a roll of his wrists two knives appear in his hands. On his stomach, sighting down the gun toward Lenny. Ed stepping into his line of fire, blocking Lenny. Raising an arm to stab. Ed stoops to scoop the baby from the car seat, revealing: Hi, behind her. He fires. Drilled by Hi's bullet, drops its knife. The exit wound spurts, not flesh and blood, but a brief jet of fire. Quick as a flash hurling the other knife at Hi. As the knife stings the gun out of his hand. Lenny bends to scoop up the knife he dropped. As she runs toward the bank, clutching Nathan Jr. to her chest. As Ed bursts in. The floor is littered with obedient hayseeds. From where he lies prone. BANG: The front door bursts open before Lenny's roaring hog. It sails off a step into the sunken atrium, and lands with a CRASH amidst the hayseeds.",
    "267": "As she runs for the back door and pushes through it, he slaloms through the wildly scattering hayseeds. Lenny bursts out. With a whipcrack effect he looks left, then right. He jerks the bike right, to where an alleyway flanks the side of the bank. Ed is running up the alley toward the front of the bank as Lenny enters. He roars after her, roaring down the alley. As the bike approaches behind her, closing on Ed as she reaches the mouth of the alley, a plank swings into frame, straight at the camera. Matching action as Hi finishes swinging the plank into Lenny's face, Lenny hits the ground hard as his bike spins out from under him. Riderless, twisting crazily into the street where it collapses. Lenny is rising to his feet beyond them as Hi nods encouragement to Ed. Lenny is reaching back to throw his knife. Hi, unaware, is turning to face him, presenting the plank as - the knife is thrown. It thunks into the plank, piercing it through. Hi backs up, swinging the knife-studded plank to make Lenny keep his distance. As he reaches up to unhook a chain from a ring on his vest shoulder, as the free chain drops down into his palm. Swinging the chain - WHOOSH WHOOSH - at the backpedaling Hi. As the chain snakes around it and rips it out of Hi's hands. Grabbing Hi by the shirtfront. Swings down and brass knuckles appear on it. As Lenny's fist swings into frame to club him forehand, then backhand. An uppercut from his heels sends Hi sprawling back. As Hi lands against it, banging his head. He sinks to the ground. Lenny is casually walking toward him, lighting a cheroot. Hi flops over onto his stomach and starts wriggling under the car. Hi's face in the foreground as he desperately seeks escape. Behind him we can see Lenny casually reaching down and grabbing an ankle. The shot is framed identically to the shot in the Arizona nursery where Hi pulled a baby from under the crib. Lenny pulls. Hi is dragged away from the camera and out from under the car. Struggling to stand up. Lenny wraps his arms around him and applies a tremendous bear hug. Crushed against Lenny. His hands paw futilely at Lenny's chest. Lenny finally flings Hi away. Landing in the dust, all the fight beaten out of him. Tired of the fight: He saws out both shotguns. On the guns as Lenny's thumbs draw them back. He raises the guns to fire. The end of the road. He wearily lifts a hand, defensively extending it in front of him - then stops, staring at.",
    "268": "A hand grenade pin hangs, glinting, from one of his fingers. Pawing at Lenny's chest he must have hooked his finger through its ring. Reacting. Reacting to Hi reacting. He looks down. On the bandoliers across his chest, silver pins glint in all the grenades - except one. Its squeeze-lever juts at a right angle from the grenade. Hi's jaw drops. The lit cheroot hits the ground between his boots. Scrambling to his feet. Trying to drop the shotguns to free his hands. In his panic his fingers tangle in the trigger guards. Starting to run. Finally freeing his hands. Diving behind the parked car. His hands fly in to wrap around the grenade - too late - bright light. Blows sky-high. There is a roar as if the earth were cracking open and flame as if hell were slipping out. We pan the fire to the sky. A white aluminum ladder rises up into the blackness, clanking softly. The top of the ladder arcs toward the camera. It is late at night; the nursery is dark and empty. Of the unpainted crib with the burned-in names: Harry, Barry, Larry, Garry, and Nathan Jr. As we pull back from the headboard Ed's arms are gently depositing the sleeping Nathan Jr. into the crib. Hi puts the singed copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care next to the baby. Hi and Ed looking sadly down at the baby. The silence is broken by the bleat of a squeeze-me toy as the lights are snapped on. Hi and Ed turn, startled. Nathan stands in his jammies, hair disheveled, holding a gun and squinting against the light. Keeping the gun trained on Hi and Ed, he slowly raises a pair of eyeglasses to his nose. He advances cautiously into the nursery, gesturing with his gun. Hi and Ed back away from the crib. Nathan peers in and studies the baby for a moment. He lays the gun down, tenderly picks up the baby and holds him to his chest. A tear forms at the corner of his eye. Hi and Ed are quietly moving back towards the ladder. As he bounces the baby, studying Hi and Ed. Hi shrugs. Nathan turns to put the baby back in the crib. He turns around with a thought. Hi does a small take, surprised at this much integrity. She stands looking into the crib. Hi steps up next to her and puts an arm around her shoulder. Ed starts crying softly as she gazes into the crib. Hi murmurs something to comfort her. Nathan is studying the two of them. Hi turns to face him. He speaks in a rush. Nathan looks at her. Finally he nods and sighs.",
    "27": "At first only the turrets and rooftops are visible against a torrid sky. The facades of the Moorish buildings give way to a narrow, twisting street crowded with the polyglot life of a native quarter. The narrator's voice fades away. A POLICE OFFICER takes a piece of paper from the typewriter, turns to a microphone, and reads. An officer BLOWS his whistle several times. There is pandemonium as native guards begin to round up people. A police car, full of officers, with SIREN BLARING, screams through the street and stops in the market. Some try to escape but are caught by the police and loaded into a police wagon. At a street corner TWO POLICEMEN stop a white CIVILIAN and question him. The civilian pats his pockets. He brings out his papers. The second policeman examines them. Suddenly the civilian breaks away and starts to run wildly down the street. JAN and ANNINA BRANDEL, a very young and attractive refugee couple from Bulgaria, watch as the civilian passes. They've been thrust by circumstances from a simple country life into an unfamiliar and hectic world. A shot RINGS out, and the man falls to the ground. The policeman frantically searches the body, but only finds Free French literature. A EUROPEAN man, sitting at a table nearby, watches the English couple more closely than the scene on the street. A middle-aged ENGLISH COUPLE sit at a table just off the square, and observe the commotion across the way in front of the Palais de Justice. The European walks over to the couple. The police van pulls up. The rear doors are opened and people stream out. Suspects are herded out of the van, and into the Palais de Justice. At the entrance the arrested suspects are led in by the police. He puts his left arm compassionately around the Englishman, and reaches behind the man with his right hand. The Englishman seems to be taken aback by this sudden display of concern. As he pats both his breast and pants pockets he realizes there is something missing. The plane SWOOPS down past a sign atop a building at the edge of the airport. As the plane lands a swastika on its tail is clearly visible. It taxis to a stop as a group of officers march into formation in front of it. Behind them stand a detail of native soldiers keeping guard. In the group is CAPTAIN LOUIS RENAULT, a French officer appointed by Vichy as Prefect of Police in Casablanca. When the plane door opens, the first passenger to step out is a tall, middle-aged, pale German with a smile that seems more the result of a frozen face muscle than a cheerful disposition.",
    "270": "A squad car, its siren wailing, kicks up dust as it roars into the foreground. Hi and Ed are seated on folding chairs facing an agent's desk. Hi wears a sport coat over his Hawaiian shirt. Ed is in her dress blues. Looking, with a dead pan, from the file to Hi. His face still deadly neutral, the agent looks back down at the file and unfolds the accordioned rap sheet, revealing it to be a couple feet long. On Ed as she stares vacantly out the passenger window. Driving. He looks from Ed out to the road. Over Hi's shoulder as he stares listlessly at himself in the mirror, a razor held forgotten in one hand, his face half lathered and half shaved. The bedroom is somewhat messy. Ed sits on the edge of the bed, also staring listlessly. Her police uniform is on but not yet buttoned. Her hands lie palm-up in her lap, like two dead fish. Once again Hi works as his sweaty gum-chewing colleague stands idly by. Alone in his Chevy. He looks to the side. 7-Eleven. Hi and Ed sit listlessly watching TV. Ed perks up, reacting to something on TV. Hi notices her reaction and also sloughs off his stupor to watch. A newscaster silently reading copy. Behind him news footage of five nurses holding infants mortices in. Watching intently. Eyes still locked on the set, Ed reaches her hand out to Hi. Eyes still locked on the set, Hi takes her hand in his. NATHAN ARIZONA, a stocky middle-aged man in a white polyester suit, is gesturing expansively with his white cowboy hat toward a one-story warehouse store with a football stadium parking lot, chroma-keyed in behind him. The businessman takes his newspaper and releases the machine door as he turns to leave. Hi snags the door before it closes and takes his own five- finger discount copy. He flips the paper over to look at the headline. The banner headline of the Tempe Intelligencer is: Arizona Quints Go Home. A pull back from the paper shows Hi and Ed reading it together at home. They look from the paper to each other. In the middle of the desert. We are floating in toward Ed who is seated, waiting, in the driver's seat of Hi's Chevy. Hi enters frame and cinches down a ladder that is tied to the roof of the car. Pieces of red flag flutter at either end of the ladder where it sticks out beyond the car. Hi gets in the car. It starts down the long, winding road leading away from the trailer, kicking up dust. Tableau of a couple at home. Nathan Arizona is on the telephone, his stocking feet up on an ottoman.",
    "271": "Florence sits reading Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. The living room is dominated by a large oil portrait of Nathan and Florence, gazing out from the wall over the mantelpiece. From somewhere upstairs we hear an infant start to cry. Florence stops reading and looks up at the ceiling. Nathan is oblivious. The baby stops crying and Florence's attention returns to her book. As he throws out his wrist to look at his watch a third title is supered beneath the first two: 8:45 p.m. He starts to replace the receiver but brings it back with an afterthought. As he slams the phone into the cradle the titles disappear. Another baby starts crying. Florence looks up at the ceiling. Close on the crying baby as Hi bounces it, gently but desperately. They sound restless. The floor-level wide-angle shot shows a baby crawling toward the camera in the foreground. Behind him, in the background, just rounding the open door from the nursery, yet another baby is making a mad dash for freedom. Hi emerges from the nursery and, stepping around the background baby, trots toward the baby in the foreground. By the time he reaches it the low-angle cropping shows us only his feet and calves. The baby and, beyond it, the stairway down to the main floor. He scoops up the baby and hurriedly tiptoes away toward the nursery. The baby at the nursery door in the foreground; the staircase in the background. As Hi reaches the baby we hear footsteps climbing the stairs. Hi's free arm comes down into frame to scoop the baby up and out of frame just as: Florence's head appears, bobbing up as she climbs the stairs. She approaches the nursery, still clutching the Dr. Spock book. As Florence enters from the hallway door. We track back into the room, on her, as she approaches the crib. Halfway there she freezes, staring, in shock. ED'S POV of Hi approaching the car. He is shrugging and displaying a pair of manifestly empty hands. Hi appears at her - the driver's-window. He is reaching to open the door but she slaps his hand away from the handle. He is trying to open the door, which Ed is holding shut with all her might. Ed is rolling up the window and locking the door. Muffled, through the closed window, and very forlorn. Florence is holding one of the babies cradled against her shoulder. The baby, peeping out over her shoulder, is facing the window. Looking. Of the window, as Hi's head appears in it. Looking. Looking back, he holds a finger to his lips. Florence starts bouncing it, patting it on the back. Hi and the window bouncing up and down.",
    "274": "The Biker approaches, craning down as he draws near. With the crane down we momentarily lose him from view over the rise; then suddenly - ROAR - he tops the rise and, wheels spinning, is airborne. As he crashes back down to earth in the foreground and roars away. Only now we are no longer in the desert: We are looking down a twilight street at the end of which is the Arizona house. The roar of his engine and clank of his chains recede as the Biker gradually dissolves into thin air. We are left looking at the empty street and the faraway Arizona house. The receding roar has left behind eerily beautiful singing, a woman singing a lullaby. Faintly, behind the singing, there is also a droning high-pitched noise. The camera starts floating forward very close to the ground, moving slowly toward the Arizona house. The high-pitched drone is becoming less faint under the singing. The camera is accelerating. The drone is growing louder - we can now tell that it is a human scream. As we approach the Arizona house we can see that a ladder is propped up to a second-story window. We are moving quite fast now. The scream all but buries the singing. We are rushing toward the house, toward the base of the ladder, the sustained scream drawing us on. We hurtle toward and then straight up the ladder with no abatement of speed, sucked forward by the deafening scream. We reach the top and hurtle - THWAP! - through the white curtains of the open second-story window into the nursery to reveal Florence Arizona, her back to us, screaming over the crib. We are rocketing toward her. She is turning to us, hands pressed to her ears, mouth stretched wide in an ear-splitting shriek and we are rushing into an extreme close-up of her gaping mouth and her wildly vibrating epiglottis and we. As they snap open. The screaming snaps off at the cut. The singing that the building scream covered, however, is now audible again. Perspiration beads Hi's forehead. It is now morning. Ed walks back and forth, gently bouncing the baby as she walks. She is singing it a lullaby. Hi is getting out of bed. The orange sun, rumbling, perceptibly rising. At the cut the rumble of the sun is snapped off by the high-pitched ba-WEEEEeeee. of a strobe going off as a flash picture is taken: We are looking over Nathan Jr.'s shoulder as he stands at his open front door, facing a battery of press people who stand out on the porch. An obie light over a local TV news camera glares in at us; various flashbulbs pop.",
    "275": "A POLICEMAN from inside the house is taking Nathan by the elbow. As Nathan allows himself to be led back into the house he calls back over his shoulder. We are following the two, hand-held, as the Police leads Nathan toward the living room. The room is filled with policemen milling about in several different uniforms: local police, state troopers, plainclothes detectives. The original Policeman is leading Nathan to a table where a white-smocked technician is preparing inkpad and exemplar sheets. The dialogue is urgent, rapid-fire and overlapping. BYRUM has taken Nathan's right hand and is rolling its fingers onto the inkpad. Nathan jerks his hand away. Two men in conservative suits are approaching. Giving his hand back. Also raising his voice at the offscreen bellower. Nathan is getting worked up. He grabs the overcoat being displayed by FBI #2. Nathan realizes that he's gotten ink from his fingerprinting all over the coat. He furiously kicks the coat. Throughout the speech Nathan stalks the room, working himself into a frenzy, furiously putting coffee cups onto coasters, generally cleaning up, hectoring the police, and swiping their feet off his furniture. Specifically, it is the hole in the muddy patch of earth that Gale and Evelle climbed out of. We are pulling back to reveal the feet-the shiny black patent leather shoes and blue pants cuffs - becoming quickly spattered - of several policemen milling about the hole. German shepherds sniff around also. With a roar, motorcycle wheels enter frame. The bike's jackbooted rider casually tools around the hole once; police step back and dogs skitter away to give him room. He backs toward the camera and stops, standing astride the bike. The whipcracking Biker cue mixes up. The Biker is shaking his head; he doesn't think they went that way. Suddenly, with a loud whipcrack effect, the Biker's head snaps to profile. He is staring across the field, stock-still, having heard, smelled or sensed something. The dogs milling around the hole also react, snapping to attention, a split second after the BIKER. A jackrabbit is bounding away at the far end of the field. After a moment, their attention returns to the hole. His attention also returns to the matter at hand. He squints, concentrating. His bike rumbles. It is the bathroom where we earlier saw Gale and Evelle combing their hair, now empty. The bathroom is quiet except for the dripping sink, and the faint rumble of an approaching motorcycle. It grows louder, then begins to recede as the bike shoots by the station. Suddenly we hear the screech of the bike's brakes. We are on the road outside the gas station as the motorcycle screeches to a halt in the foreground.",
    "28": "Laszlo turns off the light. He sits down on the couch next to her. It grows strained. A silence falls between them. Ilsa still cannot look at him. Ilsa finally turns to look at Laszlo. He bends down and kisses her cheek. He kisses her on the cheek and goes out the door. She stands there for a few seconds, then crosses to look out of the window. She sees Victor walking down the street and closes the blind again. The figure in the archway is gone. Ilsa gets a cloak from the bedroom, and leaves the hotel room. Carl is busy figuring. Rick and Carl sit by the bar and look over ledgers. He looks up at Rick. Carl laughs. Ilsa comes over to meet him. He walks over to the window and Ilsa follows. Rick walks over to a table and opens a cigarette box, but finds it empty. There are tears in her eyes now. He turns away to light a cigarette, then back to Ilsa. He stops short as he sees Ilsa holding a small revolver in her hand. It's pointed directly at him. He moves closer to her. Her hand drops down, and there are tears in her eyes again. She turns and walks away from him. Rick follows her and takes her in his arms. She is lost in his embrace. He presses her tight to him. Rick kisses her passionately. From his window, Rick watches the revolving beacon light at the airport. Ilsa sits on the couch. On a table before her rests a bottle of champagne along with two half-filled glasses. Rick walks over to her. Rick sits down with Ilsa. Ilsa puts her head on Rick's shoulder. She snuggles closer to Rick. They run inside the entryway. The headlights of a speeding police car sweep toward them. The lights move past them. They flatten themselves against a wall to avoid detection. Laszlo and Carl make their way through the darkness toward a side entrance of Rick's. Laszlo and Carl enter and cross toward the bar, out of breath from their exertion. Carl goes behind the bar. Rick and Ilsa hear voices below. Rick crosses to the door. He opens it just enough to see below, and turns off the light. Ilsa stands just in back of him. She makes a move as if to go out to the balcony but Rick's pushes her back. She withdraws behind the door. Rick walks out to the balcony railing. Rick sees Carl attending to Laszlo, who appears to be injured. Both Carl and Laszlo look up. Carl looks up wonderingly, then starts toward the stairway. Carl climbs the stairs. Carl enters Rick's apartment and sees Ilsa.",
    "280": "The camera pans farther left to the salesman's apartment. There are no lights burning behind the drawn shade of the bedroom, but the living room and the kitchen are lighted. The camera continues its pan to the left, to include the couple who sleep on the fire escape in the hot weather. He is in the act of laying out the mattress. His wife is slightly younger, peroxided, faded show girl type. Also wearing pajamas, with a fluffy handkerchief in the left pocket, the wife is leaning over the railing holding onto the rope which leads to the dog's basket now on the floor of the courtyard. The man is balding, and middle-aged. He is wearing striped pajamas. Having been a one-time siffleuse, her call to the dog is clarion and melodic. The little dog emerges reluctantly from the shadows, and steps into the basket. It begins to move upward, and the camera follows it. When the basket reaches the fire escape, the camera pans on to the apartment of Miss Torso. She is in the bathroom brushing her long hair, while her thoughts seem to be far away. The camera drops down to the apartment below, occupied by the elderly lady with the hearing aid. She is hard at work on a piece of abstract sculpture. For the first time we see something of her activities inside the apartment. She wears a short smock, although her legs are still bare. It takes the form of a piece of mahogany through which a simple hole has been carved. The camera moves on much farther to the left, and eventually comes to rest on the newly-weds' apartment with the shade still drawn. It moves on and at last passes though Jeff's window, and comes to rest on the two bid heads of Jeff and Lisa. Her lips are brushing lightly against his cheek as she speaks. By her position, Lisa is seated on Jeff's sound knee, her arms around his neck. She starts kissing him. She gives up trying to interest him in romance, and moves back from the embrace. Lisa stands, straightens out her dress, stretches a little then she turns to the divan, apparently not too interested in his observation about the salesman's life. However, her expression is disturbed as she watches Jeff. We are now able to see that Jeff's apartment is in darkness, only faintly lit from the distant light of the neighbors' window. Jeff is thoughtful for a moment, then he relaxes and smiles a little. Lisa stretches herself out on the divan.",
    "281": "Miss Torso is lying, face down, on her divan bed. Her head rests on the cushion at the far end, and she instinctively falls into an attractive pose. Her back is bare, and all she wears is a pair of brief dark blue shorts. The only light in the apartment is from a reading lamp. She is reading a book held in one hand, while eating a sandwich in another. At one point, she lifts her torso up slightly to brush crumbs out from beneath her. Jeff moves his eyes slightly to something outside the window. Lisa leans forward and looks out the window to see what Jeff is referring to. She turns back to him with a blank stare. Jeff turns and looks at her, quite unaware of her surprise at his comment. He looks away from Miss Torso, thoughtfully. Lisa sits bolt upright on the divan. She reaches back quickly and pulls on the overhead light. At that moment the songwriter returns to his composing. He is beginning his song again, and it has taken on new fullness and melody. Although it is not complete, it is farther along than before, and he plays his theme a number of different ways, trying to move it note by note to its completion. Lisa just stares at Jeff for a moment. We can see him over Lisa's shoulder. Jeff is staring out of the window again. Over this we hear Lisa's voice. Jeff puts out a restraining hand. At last the salesman is seen coming along the corridor. Slung over one shoulder, with his arm through it, is a large coil of sturdy rope. He goes through the living room into the bedroom. Jeff reaches quickly for his binoculars, and trains them on the salesman's apartment. Lisa, still stretched out on the divan looking at Jeff, suddenly sits upright and then getting up from the divan, moves over to Jeff. In a sudden surprise move, she swings his chair completely around so that his back is to the window. He drops the binoculars into his lap in surprise. The camera moves in as Lisa leans over Jeff, gripping both sides of his chair. Jeff tries to turn around, but she won't let the chair move. She turns the wheelchair slightly to her left so that he can see the newlyweds' apartment. A dim light burning behind them. The drawn shades of the newlyweds' apartment. Jeff looks, turns back to her, trying to suppress a chuckle. She is still staring out the window, as the scene. We see that his left hand rests on the telephone receiver which is close to him. Jeff is seated in the dark, his face lit by the faint glow from the distant street.",
    "284": "She looks toward the front of Thorwald's apartment house. And by her attitude we can see that there is no truck outside. She looks about her for a moment. The figure of Stella is seen, looking up toward Jeff's apartment, and arms outspread in a helpless gesture. Jeff lowers the binoculars, discouraged. He lowers the glasses, and turns to Jeff. SHOOTING TOWARDS the big window, with the neighborhood beyond, Jeff is as usual seated in his wheelchair on the left of the window, but now turned toward a newcomer. The second man is standing near the divan looking out the window with the binoculars. This newcomer is POLICE DETECTIVE LIEUTENANT THOMAS J. DOYLE, the man Jeff phoned earlier in the day. He has a sense of humor. Jeff lifts his hand in a feeble parting gesture. He is an intelligent-appearing, well-dressed modern detective. Doyle paces a little. He goes up the steps to the door, putting on his hat. He pauses his hand on the door knob. From Doyle's viewpoint. Jeff answers, showing only the slightest irritation. Doyle, still at the door. He starts to go out the door, and closes it behind him. Doyle becomes interested in watching something out the window. Miss Torso, in ballet costume, practicing her dance on the outside balcony. She is exciting and desirable. He even smiles somewhat secretly to himself at what he sees. Jeff smiles at catching Doyle enjoying Miss Torso. Jeff notices Doyle's interest. Startled at being observed, Doyle moves quickly away from the window, affecting nonchalance. Jeff's face grows serious. Doyle quickly collects his thoughts, and gets back to the case at hand. THE CAMERA MOVES BACK as Doyle returns to his drink. He moves to the sideboard, picks up a felt hat. He pulls a slip of paper out of his pocket. Jeff watches him intently. He looks at Jeff with some smugness. He puts on his hat, and goes toward the door. THE CAMERA is concentrating on the long-focus lens camera which fills the screen. Just beyond, there is a plate on which a solitary sandwich. Jeff's hand comes in, picks it up. We PAN US with the sandwich until Jeff's head fills the screen. Jeff is sober. Except for a small light in the kitchen, Jeff's apartment is in darkness. As he munches, he keeps his attention on the neighborhood. THE CAMERA PANS slightly to the left, as we see the dog being lowered in its basket. Thorwald's apartment is darkness. The sun has just set. We follow the basket down to the yard which brings Miss Lonely Heart's apartment into view. She seems to be putting on the final touches of her make-up, prior to going out.",
    "288": "The brick is weather-worn and faded. Each apartment has three windows facing the back, one showing a hallway, one a living room, and the window on the right opening into a bedroom. He sets down the case heavily, removes his hat, and slowly wipes his brow with the back of his right hand. He takes off his coat and tie. With his eyes still focused on the distant apartments, Jeff continues talking with Gunnison. His shirt is stained with sweat underneath. He rolls up his sleeves, and his well-muscled arms heavy with hair confirm his dark, husky build. The man enters the bedroom. The woman sits up as the man enters. She takes a wet cloth off her forehead. Before the man even reaches her, she begins talking, somewhat vigorously. We can see a woman lying on the far bed. Near her, a small table is covered with medicine bottles, spoons, boxes of pills, a water pitcher and the other impedimenta of the chronically ill. The man stops short of the bed, makes gestures of trying to placate her, but she goes on scolding. He hangs up and resumes his attention on the apartment of the salesman. The salesman looks toward the bedroom door, hesitates, then reluctantly walks toward it. He shouts back at her, turns and goes out of the room. His attitude changes to weary patience, then irritation, then anger. For a moment he is hidden by the wall. Jeff shifts his look more to the right. Jeff's attention is suddenly diverted to himself. His leg, under the cast, begins itching. He squirms, tries to move the leg a little. He scratches the outside of the cast, but the itch gets worse. It gives no relief. He reaches for a long, Chinese back scratcher lying on the windowsill. Carefully, and with considerable ingenuity, he works it under the cast. He scratches, and a look of sublime relief comes over his face. Satisfied, he takes the scratcher out. As he replaces it on the windowsill, his attention is drawn back to the scene outside the window. We see the man who left his apartment in anger come out of the doorway into the backyard. He is easy to identify through the color of his garish necktie. In one hand the man carries a small garden hoe and rake, and in the other a pair of trimming shears. He goes to a small patch of flowers, perhaps three feet square. They are beautiful, multi-colored three foot high zinnias. Jeff's attention is turned to something else of interest. Into the next door yard we see emerging from the apartment below the ballet dancer, the elderly lady. Her skin is dead white, and her body is thin to the point of emaciation.",
    "289": "She gets up from Jeff's lap, and puts the overnight case on the table. She goes to the window, and looks toward the song-writers' apartment. The party at the song-writer's has grown considerably larger. An assortment of well-dressed people have now crowded into the studio. They are drinking, eating, etc. Lisa stands, listening, entranced. Jeff watches her. She sits down on the edge of the divan near Jeff. She leans toward him. Jeff's tension eases off a little, but he is eager to talk. Doyle looks back toward Thorwald's bedroom. We see the dark apartment beyond him. He turns his head suddenly at the sound of Lisa coming out of the kitchen. She is rotating them gently toward the body to warm the brandy. She is quite beautiful. She holds two large brandy snifters containing some brandy. They are cupped in her hand, the stem between her fingers. She continues rotating the brandy. She comes forward hands one snifter to Jeff. Doyle reacts to her appreciatively. She offers the second to Doyle. Doyle sort of smiles, and takes the snifter awkwardly. Doyle bows his head slightly, but his eyes remain on her in a fixed stare. Lisa smiles in return. She turns around, and goes right back into the kitchen. Doyle stares after her, ignoring her remark, still not recovered from the first sight of her attractiveness. Then quickly, his eyes move down and to the left. The open overnight case with its displayed lingerie. Slowly Doyle's eyes travel back to Jeff. Quickly guessing what's on Doyle's mind. Jeff picks up the phone. He turns his head to Lisa, who answers. Doyle looks suddenly interested. He asks tersely. His head snaps back to Jeff, who answers. His head moves back to Lisa as she answers with a touch of pride in her voice. Before Doyle can comment, Jeff asks impatiently. Doyle smiles at Jeff, and then strolls over to the table where he puts out his cigarette and puts down the brandy snifter. Doyle goes to the window and looks out, as they watch him, expectantly. His voice is flat and to the point. He speaks without looking at them. Jeff and Lisa stare at him in astonishment. Then Jeff recovers, and answers with some anger. He starts to pace the room. He spins around, and his face has lost all its friendliness. She replies with some sarcasm. Lisa and Jeff. Jeff, reasoning. Lisa cuts in spiritedly. Doyle starts to pace up and down, throwing out a hand in careful explanation. Jeff is resentful of Doyle's comments to Lisa. Doyle has turned away into the center of the room. He swings around. Lisa speaks again with continuing sarcasm. Doyle comes toward the CAMERA again.",
    "29": "He looks at Rick and says nothing. Rick walks to the bar, picks up a bottle, and pours a drink. Laszlo takes a drink. Rick reaches in his jacket for his cigarette case, opens it, and takes out a cigarette. Rick lights his cigarette. He looks away for a moment. Suddenly there is a CRASH at the door of the cafe, followed by the forced entry of several gendarmes. A French officer walks in and addresses Laszlo. Laszlo looks for a moment at Rick, then in dignified silence crosses to the officer. Together they walk toward the door. Rick's eyes follow them, but his expression reveals nothing of his feelings. They're interrupted by an orderly. Renault hands some forms to the orderly, who then exits, and the conversation continues. Renault sits at his desk and smokes while Rick nervously fingers his hat. Renault gets out of his chair and crosses to the front of his desk. Renault retrieves a fresh cigarette from a box on his desk. Renault chain-lights his new cigarette with the old one. Renault sits back down in his chair. Rick stares at the floor, then looks back up at Renault. Renault presses a button on his desk, triggering a BUZZER. The door to Renault's office opens. Rick rises to go. A waiter brings tea to Rick and Ferrari, who sit alone at a table in a secluded nook off the main room. Ferrari pours a cup for Rick, who takes a sip. Rick gets up, followed by Ferrari. They shake hands to seal the deal. He walks to the door, then stops and turns around. Rick leaves. Ferrari picks up a fly swatter from the table and swats at a fly. A car pulls quickly to a stop just outside the cafe. On the door a huge placard reads. Renault looks around the empty cafe. Rick points at his breast pocket. They hear the CRUNCH of tires as a car pull up. Renault walks up the stairs to Rick's office. Ilsa quickly walks toward the entrance. Laszlo pays the cab driver. Ilsa pauses and looks at Rick, unsure for a moment. Laszlo comes in and closes the door behind himself. Renault opens the office door and peers down at the proceedings. They all walk towards the bar. Laszlo deposits his hat on a nearby table. He takes out the letters. He hands them to Laszlo, who takes them gratefully. All three hear footsteps and turn to see Renault walking towards them from the bottom of the stairs. Ilsa and Laszlo are both caught completely off guard. Horror is in Ilsa's eyes. Renault takes the letters. They turn towards Rick, bewildered. Obviously the situation delights Renault.",
    "298": "Stella takes a handful of oil, slaps it on his back. He winces. She hits him with some more cold oil. He winces again. Jeff gives an exasperated look. THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she helps Jeff to a sitting position. He buttons on his shirt. THE CAMERA MOVES IN as she helps him into the wheelchair, listening to him with exaggerated attention. He stops as he notices her attitude. Jeff now looks out to see what has happened to the old lady, and the man with the flowers. The elderly lady is now asleep in her deck chair, her face covered with the Herald Tribune. Jeff's eyes travel up to the ballet dancer's window. Dreamily, and methodically, she is brushing her long copper-colored hair. She is sitting near the window looking into an upright mirror. His eyes are suddenly turned in another direction, sharply to his left. A shade has gone up, and a man, obviously a caretaker is raising a window with some effort. Having accomplished this, he turns back into the room, and we now see him approach a young man and woman who are standing just inside the doorway. He is now looking at the windows of the apartments nearest to him. He hands a key to the young man, and then obligingly brings in two suitcases which he places on the floor beside them. He gives them a studied, but agreeable nod, then departs. We now see that the girl has a small hat with a veil, and an ornate corsage pinned to her light blue tailored suit. The boy, who like the girl is perhaps twenty years old, wears a dark blue serge suit and a grey felt hat. Quickly they are in each other's arms, kissing passionately, crushing the girl's corsage and pushing her hat back a little. They part, the boy laughs nervously, and takes a furtive glance out toward the corridor. He looks back into the room, and beckons her to come out. She follows him wonderingly. For a moment, both are lost from sight. When they reappear, he is carrying her in his arms, over the threshold. He sets her down, closes the door, and they kiss again. Then slowly, and significantly, she looks toward the open window. They part, still holding hands and looking into each other's eyes. He releases her hands, goes to the window and pull down the shade, as she is reaching upward with both hands to unpin her hat. There is a soft, understanding look on Jeff's face, and he gives an involuntary sigh. He is unaware that Stella is now standing behind him. He freezes, turns slowly to look up at her. The CAMERA makes a short sweep around the neighborhood showing that some of the rooms are now with their lights on.",
    "299": "The CAMERA PULLS BACK into Jeff's apartment until his head fills the screen. He is asleep. A shadow of some other person creeps over his face. His eyes start to open. He looks up. The screen is filled with the eyes, nose and mouth of a woman coming nearer and nearer to the CAMERA to kiss Jeff. The face is more or less in shadow, a faint light coming onto the profile from the window. The girl kisses Jeff firmly, but not passionately. Then her head moves back an inch or two. She speaks. The two big profiles filling the screen. It moves down until the lips move out of her bottom of her screen, and just the remain for fill the screen. The CAMERA FOLLOWS HER quickly to another lamp. She gets a little farther away from us so that we now see her down to her waist. She turns on the second lamp and the light shows us that her beauty is not alone in her face. The CAMERA PANS HER over to a third lamp which she turns on. She is now full figure, beautifully groomed and flawless. Her dress is high-style fashion and dramatic evening wear. Jeff looks across the room at her. She does a professional model's turn in the dress showing off its features. Jeff replies. She laughs pleasantly. She looks down at the long mahogany table beside her which is littered with a number of his personal effects. Her own handbag is also on the table. As she talks her eyes scan the table as if she's looking for something specific. Lisa finds what she has been looking for. Picks up an old and cracked cigarette box, examines it as she talks. She turns to look at him, and moves toward him, carrying the cigarette box. Lisa facing Jeff in the chair. She turns around quickly and dashes to the door, dropping the cigarette box on the table as she passes, THE CAMERA PANNING with her. She goes up the two steps, stops, turns back to Jeff. She reaches for the doorknob, turns it. She swings open the door and stands to one side. Framed in the doorway is middle-aged waiter wearing a white linen pea jacket with a red collar. His reaction is one of tender amusement. He smiles, nods enters. He's carrying in one hand a large portable warming oven, and in the other hand an ice bucket containing a bottle of wine covered with a napkin. He goes down the stairs, as she follows. He hands her the wine bucket and she places it on the table. THE CAMERA GOES with both of them. He moves toward the kitchen. She moves to a small bar set in the wall cabinet.",
    "3": "The Colonel grabs him by the collar. The Colonel glances toward the window. In the window across from us, Jane peeks out from behind the drape. She quickly pulls it shut. The Colonel is suddenly, deeply shamed. The Colonel stands, still breathing heavily. He leaves. Ricky gets up and goes to his bureau. He looks at his reflection in the mirror, calmly takes a cloth and starts to wipe the blood from his face. Carolyn, wearing protective headgear, is holding a Glock 19 automatic revolver with both hands, firing it directly at us. She empties a round and stands there, exhilarated. An attendant approaches with a new round of ammunition. And she starts firing again. Her face has lost its usual resolute determination; she's actually enjoying herself spontaneously, and the lack of her usual self-consciousness allows us to see just how beautiful she is. Angle on the Glock 19 sitting on the passenger seat amidst some CDs. The Mercedes turns onto Robin Hood Trail. We turn into the Burnham driveway. A 1970 Pontiac Firebird with racing stripes blocks our access to the garage. The room, too, seems changed: sloppier, more lived in. Lester is sprawled on the couch in his underwear, drinking a beer and controlling the car. Lester's remote-controlled model Jeep is zooming across the floor of the family room, expertly maneuvering corners and narrowly avoiding crashing. She just stands there, staring at Lester. His working out is beginning to produce results. He smiles at her playfully. It's the same look she had at the beginning, when he dropped his briefcase, but whatever power that look had is gone. Lester just laughs. His face is close to hers, and suddenly the atmosphere is charged. She pulls back automatically, but it's clear she's drawn to him. He smiles, and moves even closer, holding his beer loosely balanced. Then, just before their lips meet. She's immediately sorry she said it, but it's too late. His smile fades, and the moment is gone. He stands and gestures toward all the things in the room. Carolyn stares at him, on the verge of tears, then turns and walks out of the room before he can see her cry. Jane lays in Ricky's bed, wearing a tank top. She glances at us. We're watching the wide-screen TV in Ricky's room. A cord leads from the TV to Ricky's Digicam. Ricky holds the camera, standing naked. He's aiming his camera at Jane. She gets out of bed, takes his Digicam and focuses it on him. We see his image on the TV as she videotapes. Jane zooms in on his face, which remains placid. Ricky smiles. He grabs a half-smoked joint from an ashtray and lights it.",
    "30": "He smiles as he turns toward Rick. Suddenly the smile fades. In Rick's hand is a gun, which he levels at Renault. Renault halts for a moment and studies Rick. He walks to a table and sits. As Renault picks up the phone and dials, Rick takes back the letters. Strasser is on the phone. He hangs up the receiver and presses a BUZZER on his desk. An officer quickly enters. He hangs up the receiver and, grabbing for his cap, hurriedly exits. The entire airport is surrounded by a heavy fog. The outline of the transport plane is barely visible. On the airfield a transport plane is being readied. A uniformed ORDERLY uses a telephone near the hangar door. He hangs up and moves to a car that has just pulled up outside the hangar. Renault gets out while the orderly stands at attention. He's closely followed by Rick, right hand in the pocket of his trench coat, covering Renault with a gun. Laszlo and Ilsa emerge from the rear of the car. Laszlo and take care of his luggage. The orderly escorts Laszlo off in the direction of the plane. Rick takes the letters of transit out of his pocket and hands them to Renault, who turns and walks toward the hangar. Renault stops dead in his tracks, and turns around. Both Ilsa and Renault look at Rick with astonishment. Rick's intention suddenly dawns on Ilsa. Renault countersigns the papers. Ilsa's eyes well up with tears. Rick puts his hand to her chin and raises her face to meet his own. Major Strasser drives at break-neck speed towards the airport. He HONKS his horn furiously. Laszlo returns. Rick walks into the hangar and Renault hands him the letters. He walks back out to Laszlo. Rick hands the letters to Laszlo. Laszlo extends his hand to Rick, who grasps it firmly. On the airfield the airplane engine TURNS OVER and the propellers start turning. They all turn to see the plane readying for take-off. Ilsa looks at Rick and he returns her stare with a blank expression. He then glances at Laszlo, as does Ilsa. Then Laszlo breaks the silence. Rick watches as Ilsa and Laszlo walk very deliberately towards the plane. Rick puts a cigarette in his mouth. The door to the plane is closed by an attendant and it slowly taxies down the field. Suddenly a speeding car comes to a stop outside the hangar. Strasser alights from the car and runs toward Renault. Renault nods toward the field. Strasser turns to see the plane taxiing towards the runway. Strasser looks briefly at Rick, then makes a step towards the telephone just inside the hangar door. His eyes dart towards the telephone.",
    "301": "Suddenly she buries her head in her arms over the table and starts to sob. Jeff, his glass in hand, looks out sympathetically. In the background, Lisa, having just placed a pair of candlesticks on the table, is returning to the kitchen. He is unaware that Lisa is standing behind him, and is also watching this little drama. Both of them swing their eyes a little to the left. The kitchen-lining room combination of the ballet dancer's apartment has now been made more presentable. All kitchen utensils have been put away, replaced by more attractive effects, and lamp light softens the surroundings. The ice box is now skillfully concealed by a large Chinese screen. Miss Torso is now wearing a cocktail dress, which shows off her figure to great advantage, especially when she leans toward three assorted men to offer them a plate of hors d' oeuvres. She is the perfect hostess, animated, charming, and with an added personal touch for each guest. Her every movement is followed admiringly by the eyes of the three men -- one wearing black tie, with a touch of grey in his hair, a Long Island socialite -- a young rather handsome, actor in grey flannel suit -- and last, a bright, pleasant, young man who might possibly be from Wall street, wearing a blue-pin-striped suit. She is behaving with a sophistication which was not apparent when we first saw her in the morning. Miss Torso sees that the cocktail glass of the third man is empty. She takes it over to the window, and starts to fill it. The man in the tuxedo follows her over, with a casual glance toward the other two. He stands beside her as she makes the drink. He looks at his watch with some impatience, and makes a side comment to her as to the lateness of the time. The latter two are engaged in an animated conversation. She turns, gives him a light kiss on his cheek, as if she's telling him to be patient. Instead of pacifying him, it makes him more amorous, and he puts an arm around her shoulder and plants a heavy kiss on her cheek. She turns to face him, they look into each other's eyes a moment, and she allows herself to be kissed on the lips -- but only long enough so as to attract the attention of the other two men. With a little admonishing look, she moves away from him, and makes him rejoin the other two. She moves away with a significant look to him. He ponders over her last remark, then changes his look to another direction. THE CAMERA MOVES IN until Jeff is in semi-closeup, alone.",
    "303": "Lisa slowly helping Jeff to lobster from the main dish. Shooting over Jeff's shoulder we see beyond him the divan-bed upon which Lisa is stretched out. A faint shade of disappointment is seen on Lisa's face; but she quickly recovers and looks down at the table. There is one light burning, behind Lisa's head. Jeff looks at her soberly. She pulls up a chair and seats herself at the card table. We now observe that two small lit candles adorn the table, and the rest of the room lights are out. The brightness drains from Lisa's face, and she lowers her eyes slowly toward the table. A fierce discussion is in progress. Lisa gesticulates with her hands, body and legs. Jeff raises both his hands. Lisa draws back one leg, and points a finger challengingly. Lisa, stretched out on the divan. Jeff, getting angry. Jeff is definitely angry. She looks at him for a moment without speaking. After a moment of silence, Jeff says earnestly. Jeff says, as if remembering some old experience. SHOOTING OVER LISA'S SHOULDER, and down her body, with Jeff in the chair beyond. Lisa turns on her side, and stares into the room, angrily. Lisa realizes she is getting nowhere. We see Jeff's hand coming to the foreground with a restraining gesture. Lisa, still looking out into the room, and without turning, says. She turns at last, and looks across at him. Lisa starts to rise from the divan, THE CAMERA PANNING UP. Jeff looks across at her with some concern. She moves away from THE CAMERA into the center of the room, as she says. Lisa begins to move around the room assembling her possessions preparatory to leaving. Lisa, from Jeff's viewpoint. Jeff begin to get desperate. Lisa pauses in the act of gathering her things together. She gets her stole. Jeff's eyes follow her up the steps toward the door. Jeff starts to say something then thinks better of it, and remains silent. Lisa turns in the half-opened door. Jeff tries to be pleasant, and offhand. Lisa, standing in the open doorway. Continues smiling as she close the door softly behind her. The pleasantness on Jeff's face slowly melts into baffled discouragement. A low camera has Jeff's head on the foreground, with Stella just behind him, at work on his back. She attacks the sore muscle vigorously. She stops massaging, reaches for the oil. Stella hits his back with a palmful of cold oil. It takes his breath. She helps him to a sitting position. Jeff turns his head away for a moment. Hands him his shirt, which he proceeds to put on. She helps him into the chair. The back of his chair is to the window.",
    "304": "The fellas crack up. They all mutter equivalents. Joe stands up. Mr. Blonde shoots Mr. White with his finger. Everybody whips out a buck, and throws it on the table. Everybody, that is, except Mr. Pink. Everybody laughs. They all laugh. They all laugh. Mr. Pink rubs two of his fingers together. They all laugh. Joe's comes back to the table. The Somebody screaming is Mr. Orange. He lies in the backseat. He's been SHOT in the stomach. BLOOD covers both him and the backseat. Mr. White is the Somebody Else. He's behind the wheel of the getaway car. Though he's driving for his life, he keeps talking to his wounded passenger in the backseat. They are the only two in the car. Then the door swings open, and Mr. White carries the bloody body of Mr. Orange inside. Mr. Orange still is MOANING loudly from his bullet hit. Mr. White lays him down upon a mattress on the floor. Mr. Orange looks up at his friend. Mr. White gets Mr. Orange in a HEADLOCK. Mr. Blonde sits on a counter, drinking a fast food coke and eating a hot dog. Mr. Pink sees Mr. Orange on the floor, shot and bloody. Mr. Orange lays his head back on the mattress. The two men end up on the floor KICKING and SCRATCHING. The camera creeps along a wall, coming to a corner. At the end of the hall is a bathroom. Mr. Pink is obscured, but Mr. White is in view. Mr. White turns to leave. Guns FIRING, people SHOUTING and SCREAMING, sirens WAILING. Mr. Pink tries to open the driver's side door, but it's locked. The Shocked Woman starts screaming. He looks to Mr. Pink. Mr. Pink exits frame, leaving Mr. White alone. The men share a laugh. We follow behind him up to Mr. White, who's standing over Mr. Orange. As he gets closer he sees Mr. Orange is out. Mr. White stands up and walks over to a table. Mr. Pink reaches in his jacket for his gun, and pulls it out. Mr. White sees this, immediately lets go of Mr. Pink, and goes for his own weapon. The two men are with their guns outstretched, aiming at one another. Mr. Blonde looks at his two partners in crime. Mr. White explodes, raising his gun and charging towards Mr. Blonde. Mr. White calms down and puts his gun away. Mr. Blonde stops moving. Mr. Blonde heads for the door. The other two men just follow him with their eyes. Mr. Blonde walks out. Mr. Blonde is walking towards the car he drove. Mr. White and Mr. Pink are walking behind. In the background we see what looks like an office set up.",
    "31": "With him are HERR HEINZE, the German consul, CAPTAIN TONELLI, an Italian officer, and LIEUTENANT CASSELLE, Renault's aide. On any occasion when MAJOR STRASSER is crossed, his expression hardens into iron. Herr Heinze steps up to him with upraised arm. They shake hands. Heinze introduces Strasser to Renault. Renault salutes. He is a handsome, middle-aged Frenchman, debonair and gay, but withal a shrewd and alert official. As they acknowledge each other, Captain Tonelli barges in front of Casselle and salutes Strasser. But Tonelli gets no further than that as Strasser turns again to Renault. They walk away from the plane, Heinze following, with Casselle and Tonelli bringing up the rear, engaged in a heated exchange of words. The neon sign above the door is brightly lit. Customers arrive and go in through the front door. Again we isolate on the neon sign. We follow a group of customers inside. Rick's is an expensive and chic nightclub which definitely possesses an air of sophistication and intrigue. The occupants of the room are varied. There are Europeans in their dinner jackets, their women beautifully begowned and bejeweled. SAM, a middle-aged Negro, sits on a stool before a small, salmon-colored piano on wheels, playing and singing while accompanied by a small orchestra. There are Moroccans in silk robes. Turks wearing fezzes. Members of the Foreign Legion, distinguished by their kepis. Two men sit at a table. His companion seems uninterested in his dilemma. Sympathy is evidently in short supply in Casablanca. At another table a very well-dressed WOMAN talks to a MOOR. She has a bracelet on her wrist. On to another table where two CONSPIRATORS talk. He stops abruptly as two German officers walk by. A REFUGEE and another MAN converse at another table. On the way to the bar we pass several tables and hear a Babel of foreign tongues. CARL, the waiter, is a fat, jovial German refugee with spectacles. He walks, tray in hand, to a private door, over which ABDUL, a large, burly man, stands guard. Abdul opens the door and Carl goes into the gambling room. Their is much activity at the various tables. At one table TWO WOMEN and a MAN play cards. They glance at another table. One of them calls to Carl. Carl laughs. The overseer walks up to a table with a paper in his hand. Then we see a drink and a man's hand, but nothing more. The overseer places a check on the table. The overseer takes the check. We now see RICK, sitting at a table alone playing solitary chess. Rick is an American of indeterminate age. There is a commotion at the door as people attempt to come into the gambling room.",
    "312": "Evan grabs his psychology textbook from under his seat, gets up and turns in his exam. Evan flashes a confident smile. Evan opens the window and checks out his Psych project: a small maze has several flatworms at one end and a bowl of cornflakes at the other. Cricket puts on her Doc Martens as Evan watches the worms. Plenty of underage students carry pitchers of beer to their tables. Evan and Thumper play pool against two young women. HEIDI, beautiful, wears ripped jeans, no make up. Thumper seems oblivious to their taunts as Evan knocks the three-ball in the side. Another barrage of popcorn hits Thumper's jacket. Although his hand clenches on the cue. He meekly shuffles away to the opposite side of the pool table from the cackling Greeks. Evan and Heidi, making out, burst through the door and fall on the bed. Evan's shirt is unbuttoned and Heidi strokes his chest. Suddenly Heidi stops and sniffs the air. Evan drunkenly crosses the room, grabs two beers from the mini-fridge. Heidi takes one. Looks under the bed. Color drains from Evan's face as he realizes what he's reading. As Evan reads, the world seems to ALMOST IMPERCEPTIBLY VIBRATE around him LIKE A TUNING FORK. Evan looks around, utterly confused by his surroundings. Before an answer comes, Tommy smiles at his good fortune and swings the plank, hitting Evan's head. Evan is sent sprawling backwards, his forehead bleeding freely. Tommy knocks Evan hard in the ribs with his boots. Evan writhes in agony, his face against the ground. Lenny moves toward the gunny sack, lifts it and tugs desperately on the rope that traps Crockett inside. Tommy spins around and flashes an evil smile. Evan, beaten and bloody, reaches out with his last bit of strength, grabs Tommy's foot and holds on. Lenny remains frozen in place. Tommy yanks his leg back, breaking Evan's grip. Tommy smiles viciously at Lenny, traumatized to watch Tommy pick up the lighter fluid and spray a liquid fuse from the campfire to the soaked gunny sack. Evan comes to with Heidi slapping him awake. After getting his bearings, he grabs his jacket and exits, leaving her dumbfounded. Evan drives. Evan, exhausted, finally pulls into Lenny's driveway. Now 20, making a model airplane. The room is filled with model airplanes. Mrs. Kagan, grayer, fatter, opens the door and escorts Evan inside. Lenny looks up to see Evan, his jaw drops. We see he's working on the model again, in his own world. Evan picks up a model airplane from the desk. Evan, startled, drops the model on the desk. He gets no answer from Lenny, who stands in the exact same spot. Evan spins to face her.",
    "313": "Evan, Kayleigh, Lenny, and Tommy, all thirteen, watch the mailbox across the street with intense anticipation. The mailbox. Suddenly a car appears from down the street and slowly pulls into the driveway. MRS. HALPERN, 24, an attractive young mother, gets out of the car and walks to the mailbox. Mrs. Halpern walks back to the car. Evan is terrified. Then Lenny suddenly moves back and begins working on the model again, his eyes a million miles away. Furthermore, the walls behind him vibrate, slightly worse than before. When Evan comes to in this memory, the lit cigarette absently drops from his mouth and nestles into the folds of his shirt. Evan looks on in horror and suddenly clenches his teeth in pain and silently swipes the front of his shirt, sending the lit cigarette to the ground. He pulls up his shirt revealing a fresh BURN MARK on his stomach. Andrea shakes her head. Evan nods, but something gnaws beneath the surface. Evan hastily hunts through his journals, tearing up the room looking for a certain book. Thumper, lying on his bed, quietly watches Evan with growing concern. Thumper jumps off the bed and snatches the journal away. Thumper begins scanning the journal entry. He hands the journal back to Evan. Evan opens it and begins reading it silently. His hands begin to tremble and he slams the book shut in defeat. Evan pulls into a parking lot of a country diner. Evan is about to enter when he spots Kayleigh coming out of the kitchen with a tray full of food. Her BOSS stares back in aggravation. Kayleigh's face turns beet red as she bends down to clean up the order. As she brings the mess inside the kitchen, a CUSTOMER pinches her ass. Evan closely studies her reaction to the offense. She flinches uncomfortably but then composes a smile for the customer. Evan backs out uncomfortably. Kayleigh struggles with the zipper of a shabby coat as she exits. Evan steps out of the shadows. She's startled at first, but eventually recognizes him. A smile flickers across her face and she allows herself to be hugged. Kayleigh nods and they walk down the street. She reaches into her pocket, pulls out a pack of smokes. Evan nods and scrutinizes her face with his next question. Kayleigh stops walking and crushes her cigarette. Kayleigh begins to tremble. Tears flow. Kayleigh runs, stops and turns back to Evan. She turns and runs away. Evan, tired and depressed, sits on the lawn nearby, fingering the new burn scar on his belly. Evan enters his dorm. He ignores Thumper, who sits on Evan's bed sucking furiously from a gurgling bong. Evan puts a towel under the door.",

    "321": "The HUM OF THE RING seems to grow louder in Frodo's ears. Gimli suddenly stands, excited. Gimli suddenly rushes forward! He swings his axe down on the ring. The axe shatters with a deafening crack! Gimli falls backwards, staring in disbelief at the ring, unharmed! Frodo winces as an angry image of the fiery eye hits him! He slumps in his chair, clutching his forehead. Gandalf looks at him with concern. Stunned silence. The council sits with downcast eyes, as if a great dread has descended on them. Boromir addresses the council in a quiet voice. Gimli leaps to his feet. Motion. The angry faces, the shaking fists, the accusatory fingers, his eyes move across to the ring. The hum grows louder in his head. THE RING fills the screen. Streams of blood flow across the surface. Flames flicker within the Gold Band. FRODO, breathing rapidly, caught in the grip of his hideous vision. With a huge effort of will, Frodo tears his gaze upon the ring. Frodo suddenly stands. He speaks in a strong, clear voice. Sudden silence. Frodo looks around the room at the astounded faces. Boromir looks at them all then walks towards Frodo. Boromir looks towards Elrond and Gandalf. Frodo stares in wonder as the Greatest Fighters in all Middle earth stand at his side. Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush. An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather Scabbard, its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold and bright. Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo. Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail. Frodo peels off his shirt revealing The Ring on the Chain around his neck. Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo. For a split second he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony, groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked. The shadow passes. Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo falters, his eyes filling with tears. Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him. The Fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven vale of Rivendell. The fellowship trekking through a land of Deep Valleys and turbulent waters, the misty mountains rise sharply to their left. Sam at the campfire. GIMLI has managed to corner Gandalf. Boromir thrusts, catching Pippin on the hand. Pippin throws down his sword, kicks and lunges at Boromir, tackling him to the ground. Much laughter. Legolas' eyes are fixed on a distant Dark Patch which darts about the sky, like flying smoke in the wind. Gandalf looks at Aragorn, turns to the others gesturing towards a high mountain pass. The Fellowship clamber through Rock and Snow. Frodo slips on some shale. As he scrambles to his feet, the Ring falls on the ground. The ring gleaming in the snow! Boromir's Hand picks it up by the chain. He stands, the ring dangling before his eyes.",
    "322": "The Fellowship are struggling through a blinding blizzard, up towards the PASS OF CARADHRAS. Legolas the Elf moves lightly across the top of the snow, he suddenly pauses. MERRY and PIPPIN are shivering in Boromir's arms. The Fellowship are walking along the far shore of dark lake, directly below great looming cliffs. Footing is treacherous on the narrow strip of green and greasy stones. Gandalf touches the smooth rock wall between the trees. Slowly, faint lines appear like slender veins of luminous silver running through the stone. A large moon rises over the mountains. The lines grow Broader and Clearer, forming a glowing arch of interlacing ancient letters and symbols. Gandalf raises his arms. Gandalf raises his eyebrows. With that, the rock face silently divides in the middle and two great Doors swing outwards revealing a blackness deeper than the night. As the Fellowship enter the Blackness, something in the water stirs. The Fellowship step warily into the darkness of Moria, a Dank cavern, with winding steps leading deeper into the mountain. A Glow from Gandalf's Staff suddenly lights the chamber. The Fellowship recoil in Horror! Many dwarf Skeletons are strewn about, clearly the dead of some old battle, the rusting armor and shields are peppered with arrows and axes. The Fellowship draw swords and back away, towards the Entrance. Frodo is suddenly PULLED TO THE GROUND. A long sinuous Tentacle is wrapped around Frodo's ankle and is dragging him towards the lake. FRODO CRIES OUT as Aragorn and Boromir rush forward! Aragorn severs the Tentacle holding Frodo, and pulls him to safety, Boromir hacks at the other Writhing Limbs. 20 more tentacles ripple out of the Lake! The dark water Boils as the hideous beast lashes out at the FELLOWSHIP! Again the creature grabs Frodo and pulls him to the lake, Frodo is flung in the air as the Fellowship battle the creature. Aragorn hacks at a tentacle, Frodo is released, falling into Boromir's arms. Legolas shoots an Arrow into the creature's head, gaining a few vital seconds for Aragorn and Boromir as they race out of the water with Frodo. The FELLOWSHIP hurriedly back away from the Creature. Retreating into the Moria Chamber as many Coiling arms seize the large doors. With a shattering echo, the creature rips the doors away, creating a rock slide that crashes down the Cliff Face. Following the crows as they race deeper and deeper, passing a vista of Industry, Hundreds of Orcs and writhing Birthsacks, flying past Saruman, who stands upon a wooden Gantry. Boromir is motionless. Boromir smiles at Frodo, ruffling his hair. Aragorn warily approaches Boromir. Frodo meets Gandalf's eye. FRODO, the weight of the decision weighing heavily upon him. He stares at the ring, as if transfixed. He seems to grow in stature, as if absorbing its power. ARAGON unhands his sword.",
    "325": "It gleams in the low rays of the late afternoon sun, green, gold, and silver. Beyond the river, the land appears flat and empty, formless and vague, until far away, it rises again like a dark and dreary wall. The sun that lies on Lothlorien has not power to enlighten the shadows that lie beyond step onto a wide fleet filled with a soft light. The walls are green and silver, the roof gold and in its midst is the trunk of the mighty Mallorn tree, now tapering toward its crown. Celeborn steps forward to greet the guests. His hair is long and silver, his face grave and beautiful, with no sign of age upon it. Next to him stands Galadriel, the Lady of the Elves. She has hair of deep gold and timeless, unsurpassed beauty. Frodo looks at Galadriel, standing silently beside Celeborn. Moonlight catches the trace of tears on Boromir's face. Galadriel's eyes settle on Sam. Gimli, Legolas, Merry, Pippin, Frodo and Sam are in a pavilion set among the trees near the fountain. They lie on soft couches as Elves leave food and wine for them. Aragorn kneels down beside him. Boromir looks at Aragorn in despair. Boromir feels Aragorn's love for Minas Tirith and takes heart. Aragorn returns Boromir's smile, betraying his disquiet sadness only when Boromir looks away. The Fellowship are asleep on their beds. Bare feet tread soundlessly across the lawn. Frodo's eyes flicker open, as if by instinct. Galadriel, her white dress glowing in the moonlight, glances at him. Frodo follows her, as if drawn by an invisible force. Upon a low stone pedestal, carved like a branching tree, sits a shallow silver basin. Galadriel pours water into the basin from a silver jug, a glow rises from the water. Frodo slowly steps up to the pedestal, he peers into the glossy surface. The night sky is reflected into the water. Frodo leans closer to the mirror's surface. Frodo gasps, his face lighting up with hope. Galadriel looks at Frodo intensely, Frodo looks down, in his hand he is clutching the ring. Frodo looks up at Galadriel. Galadriel suddenly seems to rise in stature before Frodo's eyes. Frodo is suddenly afraid of her. Galadriel suddenly laughs, a slender Elf-woman once more, clad in simple white, her voice soft and sad. Frodo realizes what her message is. The ring lies in the palm of Frodo's hand, his fingers close over it. Naked, Lurtz's eyes follow Saruman, alight with a mean intelligence. The Uruk-hai are smearing themselves in white paint, a creepy ritualistic ceremony, the white hand of Isengard is smeared on bodies, faces, and armor. Lurtz is quickly armored, breastplate, leg guards, helmet, a sword is thrust in Lurtz's hand. Saruman addresses a crowd of 200 fully armed Uruk-hai.",
    "331": "All is quiet. Frodo peers uneasily into the darkened living room. Suddenly, a large figure looms out of the shadows, reaching for Frodo. Frodo lets out a startled cry, pulls himself free and spins around to face his assailant. Gandalf steps into a shaft of moonlight. Paranoia blazes in his eyes. His clothes are dirty and ragged from much traveling. Hair and beard much longer and unkempt. Gandalf, suspicious, alert. Frodo pulls the envelope out of an old chest. Without a word, Gandalf takes the envelope and tosses it into the fireplace. Flames instantly consume the envelope, revealing the ring, as it sinks into the red hot embers. Gandalf reaches into the fire with a pair of tongs, he lifts the ring out. Gandalf drops the ring into Frodo's hand, he reacts to its weight. The gold band of the ring as fiery letters begin to appear. A tiny inscription glows red, as if burning from within, emanates from the Ring. Frodo looks at Gandalf, each knowing the other has heard it. Mordor. The ring lies between them on the table. Gandalf looks at Frodo, sadly. A teasing glimpse of Gollum being tortured by the Orcs. On a dark country lane, a Hobbit bounder lifts his watch lantern in alarm. Out of the darkness thunder two BLACK RIDERS, a lethal sword swings down at the small Hobbit bounder. Frodo thrusts the ring at Gandalf. Throwing clothes into a knapsack, Gandalf watches him, making plans. Frodo is preparing to leave. Gandalf looks at the young Hobbit, moved by his courage. Gandalf freezes. He moves quietly towards the window, eyes wide with tension. He raises his staff above the window, and slams it down on the intruder. There is a yelp of pain. Gandalf hauls a small figure into the room, Sam Gamgee sprawls across the floor! He looks up in terror as Gandalf looms over him. Hobbiton, shrouded in a white veil of mist. To reveal Gandalf, Frodo and Sam hurrying across a ploughed field, away from Hobbiton! Gandalf leads his horse, Frodo and Sam are carrying knapsacks. Gandalf leads Frodo and Sam under the cover of woods. Gandalf takes Frodo to one side. Frodo nods, he pats his pocket. Frodo and Sam hiking over the gentle Shire countryside, wading through a shallow stream. Sam stops short, taking stock of his surroundings. Sam takes a deep breath and steps forward. Sam's brown, furry foot hits the ground. Frodo and Sam continue their journey. Gandalf is galloping along the outskirts of the ancient forest of Fangorn. Nestled in a basin at the foot of the distant Misty Mountains, the tall black tower of Orthanc is clearly visible. Gandalf gallops through the gate, into the fortress of Isengard, a great ring-wall of stone, a mile from rim to rim, encloses beautiful trees and gardens, watered by streams that flow down from the mountains.",
    "333": "A long drawn WAIL comes down the wind, like the cry of some evil and lonely creature. Sam grabs Merry and Pippin as the Hobbits quickly scramble down the bank, hiding under a mossy log. THE SOUND OF HOOVES is close. A sinister MOUNTED RINGWRATH steps into view, hooded and faceless, mounted on a huge snarling black horse with insane eyes! Frodo freezes in terror. The RINGWRAITH pauses right beside their hiding place, he sits very still with his head bowed, listening. Beads of sweat gather on his brow. The ringwraith suddenly slides off his horse, leaning over the mossy log, peering suspiciously into the woods. From inside the hood comes a sniffing noise as if he is trying to catch an elusive scent; his head turning from side to side. He is drawing the ring out of his pocket, with trembling hands, his face fevered and sweating as if in the grip of some terrible INTERNAL STRUGGLE. Merry desperately hurls the mushrooms across the road. The ringwraith spins around at the sound, and darts to the far side of the road with frightening speed. Frodo instantly slumps, as if a PSYCHIC LINK had been broken. Frodo is staring, a look of shock on his face at the ring lying in the palm of his hand. The BLACK RIDER turns and departs. Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin hurry through the trees, slipping and sliding on the muddy ground. Merry moves past Pippin, toward Frodo, watching intently. Sam keeps looking around nervously. The Four Hobbits sprawled on the ground, holding their breath. The SILHOUETTE OF A BLACK RIDER looms against the skyline. Merry looks at his friend, realizing Frodo is in deep trouble. The Hobbits break cover. SUDDENLY, A RINGWRAITH bursts out of the forest TOWARD THEM. FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN, are running towards the wide, placid Brandywine river and the FERRY. The HOBBITS stampede across the Wharf and Tumble onto the Ferry. Frodo races across the Wooden Wharf, followed by the ringwraiths. He leaps into the Ferry. Shrieking with rage! The Hobbits cover their ears. Sam and Merry shove off with the poles. The ferry slides out into the river, just as the ringwraiths arrive. The Ringwraiths wheel their horses towards the north and Gallop away along the river bank, quickly disappearing into the fog. Lights of Bree, a small village of stone and half timbered houses nestled against a low wooded hill. FRODO, SAM, MERRY AND PIPPIN approaching the gatehouse, wild eyes, ragged, and out of breath. A thick hedge surrounds the village, a great gate bars the western entrance. A SURLY GATEKEEPER glances down at them. The gatekeeper swings his lantern onto the hobbits, bathing them in an uncomfortable yellow spotlight. The Hobbits gratefully enter Bree, the gatekeeper eyeing them curiously in the lantern light.",
    "334": "The tall BREE FOLK loom over the nervous little hobbits as Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin make their way through the Narrow Streets. Tall buildings tower above them. Lights glow dimly from behind thick curtains. Frodo, Sam, Merry and Pippin come rushing in. Frodo attracts the INN KEEPER'S attention. Sam watches Pippin rise unsteadily to his feet and head to the bar. Sam indicates a BROODING STRANGER who sits alone at a table in the far corner, smoking a curiously carved long stemmed pipe, peering from beneath a travel stained cowl with gleaming eyes. Frodo gestures to Butterbur. Sitting at the bar, chatting with Locals. Frodo leaps to his feet and pushes his way towards the bar. Frodo grabs Pippin's sleeve, spilling his beer. Frodo is pushed into the Hobbit's room by Strider. STRIDER SHEATHS his sword, a slight smile playing on his lips. The gate keeper comes out of his Lodgings with a lantern. A look of fear on his face. He approaches the closed gate with great apprehension. The Gatekeeper peers out of his Peephole. The gate crashed down on the gatekeeper as four RINGWRAITHS ride into Bree. The four RINGWRAITHS fly down the empty streets, like horsemen of the apocalypse. The front door FLIES OPEN. The FOUR RINGWRAITHS rush into the PRANCING PONY with WICKED SWORDS DRAWN. BUTTERBUR hiding behind his bar trembling and sweating in TERROR. PIPPIN stirs slightly, then settles back to sleep. The door creaks open. THE FOUR RINGWRAITHS silently slide into the Hobbit's room. They LOOM above each bed, raising their SHINING SWORDS ABOVE THE SLEEPING HOBBITS. Sam's eyes open wide. In unison, the RINGWRAITS STAB THE HOBBITS, in a Slashing, hacking frenzy. The RINGWRAITHS step back from the slashed beds in triumph. A hacked blanket is pulled back to reveal nothing but a shredded pillow. The RINGWRAITHS SHRIEK WITH RAGE! Sam sits up with a start! Another shredded pillow is revealed! More Shrieks of rage. PIPPIN AND MERRY wake with a start. Sam, Merry, and Pippin have been sleeping on Strider's bed. Frodo stands next to Strider by the window, peering out nervously as furious Ringwraith screeches echo across the courtyard from the Hobbits room. STRIDER, MERRY, PIPPIN, AND FRODO march through a gloomy, overgrown forest. Frodo watches uneasily as Strider moves off into the cover of the trees. SAM looks excited. Strider leads the Hobbits through the gloom of the forest. Strider leading Frodo, Sam, Merry, and Pippin across the windswept moors. The hobbits suddenly stop and unstrap their knapsacks. Strider stops, casts a glance back at Sam. Strider stares at Pippin blankly, then turns away, shaking his head. An apple is thrown to Merry, who deftly catches it. Another, aimed at Pippin, catches him on the forehead.",

SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO. FRODO shakes his HEAD. SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING. The days are growing darker. The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE ECHOES down the VALLEY. SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to FRODO. FRODO looks at SAM questioningly. FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the winding, torturous path, clambering through BRACKEN and over JAGGED ROCKS. GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THEODEN and GIMLI through dark woodland. The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN opens before them, creating an AVENUE of TREES, which allows them access along the old ISENGARD ROAD. A THICK, HUMID MIST fills the forest. The Return of the King ANGLE ON: The FOREST SEPARATES ahead, REVEALING: the RUINS of. All about, the GREAT STONE WALL is cracked and splintered into countless jagged shards. Far off, half veiled in the swirling STEAM, the TOWER of ORTHANC stands, unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap about its feet. TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL, MERRY and PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of BREADS, MEATS and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie back in the SUN. MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind. GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the SIGHT before them. GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the TOWER. TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them, ALARMING all but GANDALF. GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER. THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely. PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the water. The MUDDY waters GLOWING with a golden light. ARAGORN turns as, quick as a FLASH, PIPPIN has jumped off his horse and picked up -- the PALANTIR.",

SAM breathes deeply now, heavily asleep. GOLLUM grimaces in DISTASTE as he pulls out the LEMBAS BREAD. Quietly he SPRINKLES CRUMBS over the sleeping SAM. GOLLUM as he throws the remaining LEMBAS BREAD over the cliff. SAM'S EYES flick open. GOLLUM spins around, caught off guard. Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away. SAM gently shakes FRODO'S shoulder. SAM rummages through his KNAPSACK, looking for a bite to eat. FRODO sits up slowly. SAM stops rummaging. SHOCK on his face. SAM slowly turns to GOLLUM. GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM'S JACKET. sending LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN. SAM is ENRAGED. he throws himself at GOLLUM. punching him. FRODO pulls SAM off GOLLUM. FRODO COLLAPSES on the GROUND!

FRODO pushes SAM away, clutching at the RING beneath his shirt. FRODO rises to his FEET, as if empowered with a frightening intense ENERGY. SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF.

    "34": "Strasser looks up from the book. Rick reaches over and takes the book from Strasser's hand. Rick looks up from the book. Rick gets up. Rick walks away toward the gambling room. A couple comes in the front door. They are VICTOR LASZLO, the Czech resistance leader, and a very pretty young woman wearing a simple white gown, MISS ILSA LUND. The HEADWAITER comes up to them. As the headwaiter takes them to a table they pass by the piano, and the woman looks at Sam. She is so beautiful, in fact, that people turn to stare. Sam, with a conscious effort, keeps his eyes on the keyboard as they go past. After she has gone by Sam steals a look in her direction. He appears to know this woman. BERGER, a slight, middle-aged man, observes the couple from a distance. The headwaiter seats Ilsa. Strasser and Renault look up at them from their table. Laszlo takes the chair opposite and surveys the room. Berger walks up to their table. Carefully lifting up the stone, he reveals. He holds it down for their view. Berger sits down with them. Ilsa tries to warn him. Berger, taking the cue, sighs and puts the ring away. Renault approaches the table from behind Laszlo. Ilsa's manner is friendly and reserved, her voice low and soft. He sits down. Ilsa glances off in Sam's direction. Renault jumps to his feet as Strasser enters. Strasser bows and smiles pleasantly. There is not the slightest recognition from either Ilsa or Laszlo. Strasser waits to be asked to seat himself. Laszlo stands. Strasser looks at Renault sharply, but sees only a noncommittal smile on Renault's face. Renault and Strasser bow shortly. Ilsa smiles back at him, but her eyes are still troubled. On the floor, CORINA strums a guitar and begins her number. Meanwhile, Laszlo looks about with apparent casualness. He sees Strasser and Renault whispering together, then notices Berger at the bar. He rises and goes off. We see Ilsa's troubled profile. While Corina sings, Sam gives a worried glance in Ilsa's direction. Ilsa watches him. At the bar, Berger sips a drink. Laszlo walks up and casually takes a place at the bar next to Berger. Laszlo takes the ring and looks at it. Berger shakes his head. Laszlo absorbs the shock quietly. He stops when Sacha brings the drink to Laszlo. Corina finishes her song, and the crowd applauds quite enthusiastically. Ilsa sits alone at her table. He sits down and is ready to play. Sam begins to play a number. He is nervous, waiting for anything. Sam looks very uncomfortable. He seems even more scared now. Of course he can. Ilsa starts to hum.",

A ROARING FIRE; a LAMB ROASTING on SPIT; LONG TABLES laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is-laid ready for the returning soldiers. Amidst the cheering crowd, EOWYN moves towards ARAGORN. As she proffers the CHALICE their eyes meet. EOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THEODEN follows her gaze. EOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed by his tone. EOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away. MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the TABLES, both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands. GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow. GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN. GANDALF watches his friend's face, seeking reassurance. FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a stagnant pool. SMEAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep. SMEAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT, eyes wide in horror. SMEAGOL'S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT face of GOLLUM. SMEAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the SLEEPING figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off his ROCK, silently sidling towards the EDGE of a STAGNANT POOL. SMEAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER. The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMEAGOL'S. SMEAGOL choking DEAGOL, fingers locked tight around his THROAT, his EYES flicker OPEN. SAM image mirrored in the water as he SMACKS GOLLUM on the HEAD with his POT. SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM! GOLLUM SCREAMS, his ARMS and LEGS FLAILING WILDLY. FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF GOLLUM.

Sam prepares to move the piano away. Sam now realizes Rick is in a very grim mood. For a long moment he just looks at her. Suddenly he pounds the table and buries his head in his arms. Then he raises his head, trying to regain control. He holds his head in his hands. Rick just stares ahead as orchestra MUSIC slowly joins Sam's playing. Rick appears shocked. Two close-ups reveal Ilsa and Rick seeing each other. Rick sits down. Rick and Ilsa look at each other. Rick takes her in his arms, and kisses her hungrily. While they are locked in an embrace they hear the dull BOOM of cannons. Ilsa reacts to this worriedly. Ilsa looks at Rick. He chuckles. Rick chuckles again. Ilsa looks at him tenderly. Ilsa smiles. Ilsa seems unnerved. There is evidently something on her mind. Rick, at the bar, gets glasses and a bottle of champagne. He walks over to Ilsa and Sam at the piano. Rick pours the champagne. His manner is wry, but not the bitter wryness we have seen in Casablanca. Sam looks at his glass. Rick and Ilsa look at each other, then hurry to the window. She smiles faintly. Renault and Laszlo approach the table from the bar. Laszlo signals the waiter. Rick takes the check. Renault leaves. They join Renault at the curb. Ilsa fixes flowers at the window while Rick opens champagne. They drink. Rick and Ilsa sit at a table. They buy a newspaper and begin to read it. Nearby, a group of frightened French people cluster around a loudspeaker on a wagon. She walks over and joins him. Inside a swank Paris cafe, Rick and Ilsa dance. They appear to be very much in love as the MUSIC plays. Ilsa flips a coin, then tosses it over to Rick. They kiss passionately. A) The Arc de Triomphe from a distance.

GORBAG lands in the GUARD ROOM with a CRASH, creating SUDDEN ALARM amongst the ORCS and URUK-HAI stationed there. SHAGRAT leans through the TRAP DOOR. SEVERAL URUK-HAI converge on GORBAG -- he LASHES OUT, slashing one across the throat with his SWORD! The DEAD URUK-HAI topples backwards over the PARAPET landing on top of URUK-HAI and ORCS in the courtyard below.

MOUNT DOOM. 50 MILES AWAY -- across the barren GORGOROTH PLATEAU -- the mountain is erupting streams of ASH and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH. With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep path into the dark kingdom. TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before them lies the PLAIN of GORGOROTH. Their eyes are drawn to the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM. FRODO's eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of FIRES which glow on the PLAINS beneath them thousands upon thousands of ORCS are encamped there. THEIR eyes are drawn to a DARK LOOMING SHAPE. A RED LIGHT seems to sweep across the PLAIN. The GREAT EYE OF SAURON! SAM cannot see what FRODO sees. GENTLY, he urges FRODO on. GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL. He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of GIMLI, LEGOLAS, EOMER and ARAGORN. ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF. GANDALF -- still troubled, still worried.

With their dearest FRIENDS gathered around them. ROSIE throws a beautiful bouquet of FLOWERS, it's caught by PIPPIN who smiles in embarrassment. FRODO walks through BAG END to his STUDY. FRODO from behind. He is HUNCHED over a DESK, to reveal BILBO'S RED BOOK open on FRODO'S DESK. He is WRITING in the LAST CHAPTERS, in careful neat HANDWRITING. FRODO turns back the pages, REVEALING: There and Back Again -- A Hobbit's Tale, by Bilbo Baggins. He writes below it as SAM GAMGEE calls out from the door. FRODO WINCES with a sharp GASP of PAIN. He puts the PEN down and CLUTCHES at his SHOULDER. SAM has entered the ROOM and stands BEHIND FRODO. He is DRAWN and PALE. SAM at a loss for words. A COLD WINTER'S MORNING. Out of the FOG rattles a SMALL COVERED WAGON; GANDALF is at the REINS. FRODO, SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN are waiting on PONIES for the WAGON, all are wearing their GREY ELVEN ROBES. GANDALF arrives in his CART. The WAGON trundles along at a SEDATE PACE. SAM, MERRY and PIPPIN ride behind, leading FRODO'S EMPTY. FRODO is SITTING in the WAGON, his ARM around his UNCLE BILBO. BILBO is extremely OLD and FRAIL. He is DOZING, his head slumped. BILBO'S eyes flutter OPEN.",
    "358": "MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face. PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTIR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED, he gazes INTENTLY into it. As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN'S FACE. PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE. THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE. PIPPIN is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT. PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM. He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY. GANDALF wakes with a start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and wrenches the PALANTIR from PIPPIN'S HANDS. ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the PALANTIR falling from his HANDS. The PALANTIR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the room to COWER BACK. GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF on his face! He rounds on PIPPIN. GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT'S SLUMPED HEAD. A lone white tree silhouetted by flames. GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING. THEODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to GANDALF. ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on. GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief. GANDALF turns to look at THEODEN. GANDALF looks from on to the other of the, gathered company. The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN. THEODEN listens intently, saying nothing. he knows GANDALF SPEAKS THE TRUTH. GANDALF rounds on THEODEN. THEODEN holds GANDALF'S gaze. ARAGORN turns to look at THEODEN. GANDALF turns on his heel. GANDALF hurries along the STREETS. PIPPIN and MERRY run alongside trying to KEEP UP. PIPPIN catches up to MERRY. MERRY turns away. This is too much for MERRY. He turns on PIPPIN. PIPPIN'S face as MERRY strides away. PIPPIN is dumped unceremoniously onto the back of SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave. MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN'S HAND. PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED. A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF. GANDALF mounts SHADOWFAX. GANDALF spurs the GREAT HORSE forward. SHADOWFAX thunders out of the STABLES! CLOSE ON: MERRY'S devastated face. SHADOWFAX carried GANDALF and PIPPIN out of the GATE and down the WINDING ROAD towards the PLAINS QF ROHAN. MERRY clambers up a WATCHTOWER, ARAGORN in pursuit. The SMALL FIGURE as he watches his best friend DISAPPEAR into the DISTANCE. he knows what it is to lose someone. ARWEN -- escorted by a SMALL ENTOURAGE of ELVES -- rides through the gathering darkness of a PINE FOREST. As ARWEN rides through the FOREST the FIGURE of a SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front of her. ARWEN reigns in ASFALOTH. something about the BOY intrigues her -- but she does not know why. As ARWEN watches the BOY moves away, the TREES begin to thin.",
    "359": "The BOY continues running. One by one the TREES TRANSFORM into TALL WHITE PILLARS. The BOY now stands within a VISION of the majestic architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS. A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves towards the CHILD. The BOY runs to the FIGURE. ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms -- swinging the LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR. The figure turns to reveal ARAGORN, a little older, dressed in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE. The CHILD, now in ARAGORN'S ARMS looks directly at ARWEN. It is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS. ARWEN'S eyes drop to the CHILD'S CHEST. Around the CHILD'S neck hangs the EVENSTAR. ARWEN as she realizes she is staring at a future that can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have. ELROND speaking to his daughter. ARWEN shuts her eyes. When she opens them again the VISION is gone. She is staring at DARK TREES once more. ARWEN turns towards her COMPANION who stares at her, concerned. ARWEN wheels ASFALOTH around. Riding away. ARWEN'S HORSE gallops over the BRIDGE and through the GATES into RIVENDELL. ELROND seated alone. ARWEN runs up the STEPS towards him. ELROND stands -- stunned. ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with a fierce light in her eyes. ELROND his face grim. Her father turns away. ELROND stares into space, the fight seems to go out of him. He won't look at her. ARWEN gently takes her FATHER'S face in her hands and turns him toward her. A HOODED FIGURE ascends a CURVED STAIRCASE towards a GALLERY. The FIGURE stops before a STATUE that holds the BROKEN SHARDS of an ancient sword in its arms. The BLADE shattering in several fragments as ISLIDUR brandishes NARSIL at SAURON. The HOODED FIGURE looks up into the sorrowful face of the STATUE. The figure is ARWEN. ELROND stares at his daughter, unwavering. A BROKEN SWORD GLOWS with RED HEAT. It's BLADE in SEVERAL FRAGMENTS. A HEAVY HAMMER pounds the RED-HOT BLADE on an ANVIL. As ELVEN-SMITHS TEMPER the STEEL. ELROND'S FACE lit by FLICKERING FIRE as SPARKS fly in the RIVENDELL FORGE. The SWORD is withdrawn from a POOL OF STEAMING WATER. LIGHT SHIMMERS as the WATER DROPS slide down the BLADE of NARSIL, the SWORD that was broken has been remade. PIPPIN asleep. GANDALF'S PROTECTIVE ARM around him as SHADOWFAX THUNDERS through the NIGHT. SHADOWFAX powers along the COUNTRYSIDE. PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND sailing through his hair. SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE. Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin, its tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its outthrust knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.",
    "364": "GANDALF spurs SHADOWFAX forward! PIPPIN clings tightly to the great horse's MANE. FARAMIR, SWORD in hand, remains at the REAR, trying desperately to fend off the DEADLY ASSAULT. AGAIN the FELL-BEASTS DIVE low. GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF. A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGUL SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD! For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto PELENNOR FIELDS. The NAZGUL circle away from the SUN RAYS, swiftly spiralling higher and higher. The NAZGUL defeated, GANDALF and the RANGERS ride towards the safety of MINAS TIRITH. IORLAS runs towards the GATES, yelling. The GREAT GATES OPEN, allowing GANDALF, PIPPIN, FARAMIR and the OSGILIATH SURVIVORS to RIDE IN. Nearly 100 WOUNDED. AS GANDALF pulls SHADOWFAX up. FARAMIR STEERS HIS HORSE through the CROWD towards. FARAMIR suddenly STARES at PIPPIN. GANDALF reads the surprise in his eyes. FARAMIR shakes his head. GANDALF, deeply troubled. FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF. The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN. They are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER -- their desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE -- trying not to look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them. FRODO'S foot slips and for a brief moment he is HANGING PRECARIOUSLY from the ROCK-FACE. GOLLUM peering down from ABOVE. he has reached. FRODO tries to CLAMBER UP onto the LEDGE. As he does, the RING slips out of his SHIRT and DANGLES in FULL VIEW of GOLLUM! LOSE ON: GOLLUM rears back in shock tenses like a CAT. FRODO, head bowed, trying to pull himself up. GOLLUM'S FINGERS closing in on the RING. SAM, still TEETERING on the PRECIPITOUS STAIRS. STARTLED, FRODO looks down at SAM, losing his footing in the process. SAM'S horrified face as. GOLLUM'S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO'S ARM pulling him SAFELY onto the LEDGE. GOLLUM glares down at SAM. GOLLUM blinks, masking the MALICE of his EYES with their heavy pale lids. GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his ear. FRODO looking at SAM. his hand strays to his NECK, closing tight around the RING. HIGH ABOVE OSGILIATH, the SINISTER PROFILE of the WITCH KING seated on a FELL BEAST as GOTHMOG stands, awaiting his orders. REACTIONS: OF GONDORIAN SOLDIERS upon the MINAS TIRITH. ANXIOUS SOLDIERS crowd around GANDALF. DRESSED in OVER-SIZED ARMOUR. kneels before DENETHOR. DENETHOR proffers his RING which PIPPIN kisses. DENETHOR gently raises PIPPIN'S head. DENETHOR'S eyes meet. DENETHOR addresses his meal. FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth. For a brief second, DENETHOR seems to hesitate, then. FARAMIR bows low to DENETHOR, then turns to leave, stops, turns back.",
    "367": "Mr. Soggybottom pulls a revolver out of his clown suit. He loads a silver bullet. Edward finally succeeds in throwing the beast off. He rolls to his feet. The hell hound squares back on its haunches, GROWLING, ready for another leap. Mr. Soggybottom sheds a clown tear, aiming the revolver at the dog. At the last moment. Edward moves just as Mr. Soggybottom FIRES. The bullet catches Edward in the shoulder, knocking him down. The carnies GASP. Licking its chops, the dog approaches the helpless Edward, who feels the ground around him, looking for some kind of weapon. He finds only a small stick. He waves it at the dog, ready to strike it. Like magic, the dog's whole demeanor changes. It bounces excitedly, ready to play fetch. Seeing an opportunity, Edward throws the stick as far as he can. The dog bounds after it. It returns a beat later with the flaming stick, which it drops at Edward's feet. Its tail whips back and forth. Edward throws the stick again. The dog takes off in a new direction. Exhausted from playing fetch all night, Edward throws the stick into the woods. The still-spry dog goes after it. It's gone for a long time, long enough that Edward becomes concerned. He follows it into the woods. Amos Calloway stands up behind a bush, buck naked and hairy. He still has the stick in his mouth, which he takes out as Edward approaches. Edward tosses him his jacket to cover his privates. Edward walks away. Then starts running. He has to get there as soon as possible. Amos sits down and scratches his ear with his foot. We DESCEND ON the main quad, to find Edward Bloom dunking his head in the fountain. He changes out of his grubby shirt into a new one, just out of the package. It's the mid-1960's, but by the conservative dress of the passing STUDENTS, it could be any era. Edward stands with a bouquet of daffodils in front of a half- open door. Through the crack we can see the edge of a YOUNG WOMAN, talking in hushed tones with another girl we can't see. Finally, a decision is reached. The door opens to reveal the woman of Edward's dreams, Sandra Kay Templeton. She's effortlessly beautiful, pure and simple as sunlight. He can't believe he's finally reached her. He half-laughs, nervous. That makes her laugh, not sure what's going on. ON SANDRA, overwhelmed. All she can finally think of to say is. She puts her hand on the door frame. On her left ring finger, we see a diamond. ON EDWARD as his heart falls 20 floors. He tries to suppress the reaction, put on a brave front.",
    "369": "She watches him while he slowly drinks the entire glass, thirstier than he imagined. Will, back from the grocery store, reaches the top of the stairs. He hears voices coming from the bedroom. Will quietly approaches the door, not exactly sneaking, but not exactly announcing his presence. The door is open a few inches, letting him look in on his father and his wife. In the hallway, Will shifts to a new position, letting himself listen to the story one more time. Bruised and bandaged, Edward sorts through a big bag of mail with help from Sandra. He rips open an official-looking letter. Reading it, his face drops. FLUTE and DRUM, music rising to a military cadence. With a buzz cut and paratrooper gear, Edward squats with a dozen other SOLDIERS. The noise of the ENGINES is deafening, but Edward is engrossed in an Asian phrasebook. The JUMP LEADER yells. One by one the men jump out, their chutes clipped to a main line. When his time comes, Edward leaps. Looking down, he can see the white parachutes disappearing into the darkness. It finally POPS. Edward jumps from the plane. A THOUSAND CHINESE SOLDIERS sit, bored, watching the equivalent of a U.S.O. show. A CHINESE VENTRILOQUIST is on stage with his Communist puppet. We have no idea what they're saying to each other, but every act is fundamentally the same. The EMCEE comes on to usher him off the stage before he's finished. The Ventriloquist protests, but finally gives in. We LOOK DOWN with Edward, who is drifting right for the stage. He can't steer. He's helpless. The lights go out as a DRUM ROLL begins. He lands with a CLANG on the lighting catwalk above the stage. He barely grabs on, disconnecting his chute just as the curtain goes up. The curtain rises to reveal PING (27) at a microphone. She's as gorgeous a woman as you'll ever see. She stands with her hips turned in profile. Her body is a knockout, dress cut to reveal skin. The soldiers are on their feet, WHISTLING and HOLLERING. UP ON THE CATWALK, Edward is surprised by an ENEMY SOLDIER. The two men begin to SCUFFLE. Ping sings melody while an off-stage voice carries perfect harmony. Ping HUFFS, turning her back on her sister. Jing reaches deeper into the closet to find a new dress, exposing Edward's hiding place. She GASPS. Ping turns to look. Jing grabs her, a hand over her mouth, but it's too late. A rifle-toting GUARD looks in. Pretending to be her bitchy sister. The guard obeys. Ping shakes her sister off. Edward pulls a photo out of his flak jacket. Even Ping is a little affected.",
    "37": "Laszlo reaches the entrance to the cafe as Rick comes out. He stops and addresses Rick politely. As he exits, Laszlo looks after him with a puzzled expression. At the linen stall, Ilsa examines a tablecloth which an Arab vendor is endeavoring to sell. Rick walks up behind Ilsa. She looks briefly at Rick, then turns away. Her manner is politely formal. Ilsa turns her head away. She walks away into the cafe as Rick stares after her in stunned disbelief. Ilsa and Laszlo sit with Ferrari. Ferrari gets to his feet and walks away. Ilsa smiles faintly. She smiles again. At the bar Ferrari talks to a waiter. Laszlo glances in the direction of the bazaar. Ferrari looks shrewdly at Ilsa. There's a moments pause as this sinks in. Ilsa's face darkens. Laszlo quietly observes. Ferrari bows. The European picks his pocket. The tourist laughs. He dashes off and collides with Carl. Carl leaves. As Rick lights a cigarette, Renault shows up. He pours a drink for Renault. Renault gets up and strolls away. At the bar, Yvonne and the German officer place their orders. She indicates with her hand where she wants them. A FRENCH OFFICER at the bar makes a remark to Yvonne. They begin to fight. Strasser eyes him closely. He smiles. Renault lights a cigarette and puffs away. Carl, bottle in hand, approaches the table of a middle-aged German couple, the LEUCHTAGS. Carl sits down. He produces a glass from a back pocket. They clink glasses and drink. Annina meets Renault in the hallway as she leaves the Gambling room. Annina sees Rick and goes to his table. Rick looks at her. Annina shakes her head. Rick pours himself a drink. Annina is very disturbed. Rick looks at her closely. Rick stares off into space. Rick abruptly rises. Laszlo looks around. Rick snaps his fingers for the headwaiter. Rick walks over to Sam and whispers something to him. He shakes his head as Rick leaves. A waiter appears at Ilsa and Laszlo's table. Jan sits at the roulette table. He has only three chips left and seems bewildered. As Rick comes up the croupier speaks to Jan. Rick stands behind Jan. Jan looks at Rick, then at the chips in his hand. Rick and the croupier exchange looks. The croupier understands what Rick wants him to do. He spins the wheel. He pauses, then puts the chips on twenty-two. The wheel stops spinning. Carl follows the proceedings, fascinated. Jan hesitates, then withdraws his hands. Carl continues to watch. The wheel spins. It stops. Jan rises to go to the cashier. A CUSTOMER complains to Carl. Meanwhile, Rick has walked over to the croupier. Rick smiles slightly and goes toward the door.",
    "371": "The man is none other than. The men shake, disbelieving this lucky coincidence. He's genuinely proud. Reaching the front of the line, Norther pulls two pistols out of his coat, FIRING both into the ceiling. SCREAMS all around. The skinny SECURITY GUARD makes a halfhearted reach for his gun, but Norther waves him off. The guard takes out his gun and slides it over. The TELLER WOMAN nods. ANGLE ON Edward, not sure what to do. He has a gun, but he truly doesn't want to shoot Norther. The Teller Woman is already waving him to the back. He decides he better go. The Teller Woman is crying as she works the combination. Edward feels horrible. She pulls open the vault door. The inner sanctum of the Horizon Savings and Loan holds exactly one folding chair. Edward winces, but doesn't say anything yet. He rips it open, revealing just a little cash inside. Even some dimes and pennies. Caught, Edward has to confess. Edward continues his narration. Norther leans in the driver's side window. Edward looks over at Norther, the reality sinking in. The two men wave at each other as Edward drives off. At the last moment, Norther calls out. Sandra is watering the garden. Will (5) runs past her to greet Edward, just returned from another trip. We reveal the Bloom house, the nicest one in the neighborhood. Bubbles rise from his nose for a few beats, then stop. It's quiet, except for the distant SPLASHING of water from the spigot. Edward's eyes are closed. A long beat. Another. Edward opens one eye. The other eye. He sits up to find. sitting on the edge of the tub. He smiles, then pulls his knees up, making room for her in the tub. A beat while she considers. Sandra steps out of her sandals and climbs into the tub, facing him. Her dress is soaked, but she doesn't mind. When they separate, she has tears hanging in her eyes. He wipes them away. Perched awkwardly on a canoe, Will's made it through another file cabinet. He goes through the folders page by page, but usually ends up tossing the whole thing in the trash. He's about to toss a file when he stops. Takes another look. Something doesn't make sense. She hands him five dollars out of her pocket. He's out the door in a flash. While Will sips his iced tea, Jenny flips through a form she never expected to see again. She hands it back to Will. A long beat. Jenny is taken back by the suddenness of it. She's a tangle of conflicting emotions. Fair enough. Jenny takes a seat across from him at the table.",
    "372": "It's late, and Edward is pensive. The first raindrops hit the windshield. Edward turns on the wipers. Suddenly, a deluge descends. It's like being caught in a waterfall. It's that loud. Puts on the handbrake. Just as suddenly, the sound changes -- no longer pounding, but softly SPLASHING. The world is close and echoing, because the car is underwater. The tires are still on the road, but where there used to be air is water. Three catfish swim in front of his headlights. Realizing his plight, Edward tries to remain calm. Water is trickling in through the crack between the window and the door, but very slowly. For now, he's fine. That's when he sees her -- The Girl in the River. She's swimming outside the car. While we never see her face exactly, she remains just as beautiful, just as mysterious, as the first time we saw her. She puts her hand to the windshield. He puts his up to meet hers. And smiles. It's morning, and the sun shines brightly. Birds CHIRP. Trees drip and the grass shines, still wet from last night's rain. The car which balances precariously ten feet up in an elm tree. He pulls it out, rubs it off. It's a key. It's the Key to the City he lost years ago. Carrying his busted suitcase, a tired Edward walks toward a one-street town in the distance. We pass a rusty sign. Amazed and disbelieving, Edward walks down the center of the road, no cars coming from either direction. He looks up to find his faded shoes still dangling from the power line, along with the rest of the town's. We look around the town, on and off Main Street. We slowly MOVE THROUGH a foreclosure auction to find Edward watching. Two very corporate MEN IN SUITS, stick out among the bidders. Edward pitches his plan to Norther. VARIOUS SHOTS: Expressive and passionate as always, Edward talks to Ping, Jing and Amos Calloway. Edward climbs out of his car, the road having literally stopped. The sun is shining, but it can barely penetrate the trees' thick canopy. In the distance, he sees a shack, so old it's nearly fallen. He walks toward it, the marshy ground SQUISHING up around his feet, soaking the hems of his trousers. Edward KNOCKS on the half-hung door, which swings open by itself. The inside is nicer than you'd think, a real home. With her back turned to him, Jenny Hill plays the piano. Without turning, she says. She keeps PLAYING. Jenny stops playing, her piece not quite finished. She turns to face him. Edward still doesn't recognize her. Strange to hear it put that way. He looks at her, puzzled and surprised.",
    "376": "Wilbur looks to Ruthie, and they're in complete agreement. They get the hell out of there. Zacky would run too, but Don holds him by the collar. Edward curves around the tall bushes that hide the front door. He steps on the porch. The boards SQUEAL and CREAK, but he continues on. A cat SCREAMS OUT from a broken wicker rocker. Catching his breath, Edward reaches the front door. The doorknob is ancient brass, two projections that look like horns. Yet Edward extends his hand, reaching closer and closer before he finally. Impossibly fast, the door opens, revealing an OLD WOMAN with a patch over her left eye. She looks like she's been dead for years, but too stubborn to lie down. Zacky and Don Price wait for Edward, each moment more convinced he's already dead. But suddenly, he's back at the gate. The Old Woman steps out of the shadows behind Edward, flipping up her eye patch. When their flashlight beam hits her left eye, it shines with a hellish glow. We RUSH IN on Zacky, who is paralyzed by what he sees. An OLD MAN -- Zacky -- stands on a wobbly stepladder, changing a lightbulb. Suddenly, the ladder gives way and he falls. Dead. We RUSH IN on Don Price. Twenty-year old Don Price falls face-forward on the tile, face mushed in the grout. Very much dead. Don and Zacky both tremble with fear. The latter has tears in his eyes. The brothers suddenly bolt. Still standing next to the Old Woman, Edward smiles. Edward helps her back inside. He could leave now, but curiosity gets the better of him. The Old Woman turns to him slightly, still not facing him. The Old Woman smiles a little, a crooked grin of broken teeth. The Old Woman turns leaning her face right in front of his. And on a silent count of one, two, three -- Edward looks into The Eye. This time we don't cut. Instead, we HOLD ON Edward as he witnesses his death. He stares transfixed, perplexed and amused. The Old Woman nods. Heading back to the house. DR. JULIUS BENNETT (85) enters from the foyer, still winded from coming down the stairs. He judges her belly. He leans close to her, whispering in her ear. She smiles, surprised but not doubting. Coming out from the kitchen, Will slowly climbs the stairs. They CREAK with every step. The wall is filled with family photos, happier times. Most of the pictures are of Will, starting when he was an infant and ending at his wedding. As he climbs the stairs, we can see him growing up with every step. A crack of sunlight spills around the half-open door at the end of the hallway.",
    "379": "Circling behind them, we look down at Ashton -- a tiny town in a tiny valley. Karl smiles, but then it fades. A certain sad suspicion. Karl thinks a moment. Then they shake on it. In a single shot, Karl cuts his hair with hedge clippers, while Edward cuts up a surplus army tent to make him a shirt. Spirits buoyed by the high school MARCHING BAND, all the good CITIZENS of Ashton are gathered to see off Edward and Karl. There's a few tears amid the familiar faces. Edward ducks a bit so the Mayor can put the key around his neck. The crowd CHEERS. And with that, Edward and Karl start walking, waving as they go. Only DON PRICE, smoking on the corner, isn't sad to see Edward go. Many of the townfolk come onto the street to hug Edward or shake his hand. As the crowd parts, he finds himself face to face with. The ruckus slows and quiets, as if a strange spell has been cast. She motions for Edward to lean down, so she can whisper something to him. Although we're VERY CLOSE, we can't hear her voice. The advice only succeeds in confusing Edward. We TILT UP from the road to reveal Edward and Karl walking out of Ashton. Each wears a backpack with all his earthly possessions. Edward and Karl come to a bend, where the paved road veers left and an overgrown dirt road runs straight. The old road is blocked with signs and warnings of danger. Karl looks at the dirt road, wary. A little paranoid. Karl perks up, even though it means more for him to carry. The road is overgrown, but not altogether creepy. The sun is still shining, and the birds still CHIRPING. The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is dead quiet. He looks back the way he came. But Edward presses on. He carefully steps through the thorns. Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands. Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs. Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind. At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting.",
    "380": "Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together. It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. Most are smiling. What's more, all of these people are barefoot. A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard. Beamen checks the clipboard. Still looking. Still confused. A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in. Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger. He didn't mean it as a joke, but for some reason, everyone's laughing. Sitting at the kitchen table, Edward takes a second slice of apple pie. He and Beamen are joined by NORTHER WINSLOW (30), who fancies himself a cultured artist, though he's never left the state. Young Jenny is stealthily untying the laces on Edward's shoes. Suddenly, Jenny YANKS OFF Edward's shoes. She races for the door. He chases after her. As she runs, Jenny ties Edward's laces together. Reaching the edge of town, she tosses the shoes up and around the power line -- a perfect throw. The gathered citizens of Spectre CHEER for Edward, who is confused and overwhelmed. The women hug him. Men shake his hand. Still focused on his shoes. The townsfolk continue to congratulate Edward. Norther grabs his notebook back. Edward looks to the bank, where young Jenny Hill is watching him. Embarrassed to admit it. He starts to wade back to the bank. Edward climbs up onto the shore, completely drenched. He pulls up his pant legs to reveal three shiny leeches clinging to his skin. Eager to get off this subject. Lanterns and streamers hang on cables across the street, and a small stage has been built at one end to hold FIDDLERS. The whole town is there in celebration of its newest citizen, Edward Bloom. Before he can protest, two WOMEN have grabbed him by the arms, pulling him in to dance with them. The resulting dance number seems both choreographed and complete chaos. From FARMER to BAKER'S WIFE, everyone wants to dance with Edward, who finds himself tossed around like a stick caught in a whirlpool. Still, he's having a blast. Jenny grabs both his hands, and they spin wildly. Beamen plucks his LAUGHING daughter away to dance with her.",
    "381": "Then Mildred cuts in to dance with Edward. It's hard to hear over the MUSIC. Edward stops dancing. A beat, then he heads for the edge of the crowd. And with that, Edward walks down Main Street. The townspeople stop dancing, disbelieving, some shaking their heads. Poor Edward Bloom's gone crazy. Jenny runs to him. She'd tackle him if she could. Edward keeps walking. VARIOUS SHOTS: Edward negotiates the thorns in his bare feet. It's horrible. Almost unendurable. And then it gets worse. The trees ahead are moving. At first, it just seems to be the wind blowing the branches, but as we hear the wood CRACKING and GROANING, there's no mistaking it: they're trying to block him. Snake-like WHITE ROOTS shoot out of the ground, grabbing for his ankles. He leaps up, kicking off one tree trunk to grab another one's branches. He swings off, lands and rolls. Now all the trees are moving to block him, their dark shapes towering over him in the flashes of LIGHTNING. As he ducks under branches, the chain holding the Key to the City gets caught. He's almost strangled, but the chain finally breaks. The silver key disappears into the mud. Scrambling forward, he looks for a way out. But the trees have encircled him, their spiky crowns bending down to crush him. He SCREAMS up at the night, until his breath is gone. With a sudden calm. Another lightning FLASH, and suddenly the trees are back where they've always been. Edward is lying shoeless and torn in a muddy puddle, staring up at the rain. And LAUGHING. His bare foot steps onto asphalt. Edward turns to see to his right, coming down the larger, paved road. Edward looks down at his muddy, bloody feet. With that, the men start walking down the larger road. Edward and Will sit at opposite ends of the table, with Sandra and Josephine in the middle. Although Edward has a small plate of food in front of him, he hasn't touched it. He's exhausted from the trip downstairs, but determined to maintain the family dinner ritual. The other three eat awkwardly, each CLINK and SCRAPE of a knife or fork resonating. Will finally breaks the silence. As Will scoops out another serving of potatoes, Edward suddenly speaks. All three stop to listen. She smiles. He tries to recollect, but it's already gone. Josephine motions, is it okay for her to sit on the bed? He nods. She shakes her head. A long beat. Then, deadpan. He rolls his eyes, why not. Josephine leaves, heading down the hall to get her camera. We STAY WITH Edward in bed. Edward grimaces, a flash of pain. Around others, he's hiding how much it hurts, but alone we can see how bad it is.",
    "383": "We top the rise and the smoggy vastness of Los Angeles at twilight stretches out before us. It is late, the supermarket all but deserted. We are tracking in on a fortyish man in Bermuda shorts and sunglasses at the dairy case. His rumpled look and relaxed manner suggest a man in whom casualness runs deep. He is feeling quarts of milk for coldness and examining their expiration dates. The Dude glances furtively about and then opens a quart of milk. He sticks his nose in the spout and sniffs. She waits, arms folded. The Dude has his Ralph's Shopper's Club card to one side and is making out a check to Ralph's for sixty-nine cents. A small black-and white TV next to her register shows George Bush on the White House lawn with helicopter rotors spinning behind him. The Dude is going up the walkway of a small Venice bungalow court. He holds the paper sack in one hand and a small leatherette satchel in the other. He awkwardly hugs the grocery bag against his chest as he turns a key in his door. The Dude enters and flicks on a light. His head is grabbed from behind and tucked into an armpit. We track with him as he is rushed through the living room, his arm holding the satchel flailing away from his body. Going into the bedroom the outflung satchel catches a piece of doorframe and wallboard and rips through it, leaving a hole. The paper bag hugged to his chest explodes milk as it hits the toilet rim and the satchel pulverizes tile as it crashes to the floor. His head is plunged into the toilet. Hands haul the Dude out of the toilet. The Dude blubbers and gasps for air. His head is plunged back into the toilet. The hands haul him out again, dripping and gasping. His head is plunged back in. The inquisitor hauls the Dude's head out one last time and flops him over so that he sits on the floor, back against the toilet. Looming over him is a strapping blond man. Beyond in the living room a young Chinese man unzips his fly and walks over to a rug. He starts peeing on the rug. The Dude gropes back in the toilet with one hand. The Dude's hand comes out of the toilet bowl with his sunglasses. The blond man stops to unzip the satchel. He pulls out a bowling ball and examines it in the manner of a superstitious native. The Dude puts on his dripping sunglasses. The blond man drops the ball which pulverizes more tile. The two men look at each other. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose with one finger and peeks over them.",
    "387": "He wears black leather pants and a black leather jacket, open, shirtless, exposing fine blond chest hair and pale skin. One arm trails off into the water; next to it, an empty whiskey bottle bobs. Brandt releases a gale of forced laughter. Brandt nervously takes the Dude by the elbow. The Dude grudgingly allows himself to be led away, still looking at the young woman. He continues to lead away the Dude, who looks back over his. Scattered by a strike. Donny calls out from the bench. As the Dude walks back to the scoring table he turns to another team in black bowling shirts--the Cavaliers--that shares the lane. He lets the small yapping dog out of the carrier. It scoots around the bowling table, sniffing at bowlers and wagging its tail. Smokey turns from his last roll to look at Walter. Walter takes out a gun. Walter and the Dude walk to the Dude's car. The Pomeranian trots happily behind Walter who totes the empty carrier. As the two men get into the car. Walter is still smug. A large, brilliant Persian rug lies beneath the Dude's beat-up old furniture. At the table next to the answering machine the Dude is mixing kalhua, rum and milk. A beep. It swings open to reveal a short, hairy, muscular but balding middle-aged man in a black T-shirt and black cut-off jeans. The Dude takes a swig of his kalhua. We are pushing Brandt down the high-ceilinged hallway. Brandt talks back over. Distantly, we hear a dolorous soprano. He turns back around and the firelight shows teartracks on his cheeks. He clears his throat. Brandt hastily pulls a flimsy sheet from his clipboard and hands it to the Dude. Brandt tugs at the Dude's shirt and points him back to the hall. The soprano's singing is once again faint. Brandt's voice is hushed. We are looking across the length of the bowling alley at a tall, thin, Hispanic bowler displaying perfect form. He wears an all-in-one dacron-polyester stretch bowling outfit with a racing stripe down each side. CRASH--scattered by a strike, in slow motion. The Dude is staring off towards the bowler. We see Quintana, in pressed jeans and a stretchy sweater, walking up a stoop in a residential neighborhood and zinging the bell. The door swings open and a beer-swilling middle-aged man looks dully out at Quintana, who looks hesitantly up. He slips a little black box out of his shirt pocket. Donny has been watching Quintana. They both look up. Quintana, on his way out, looks down at them from the lip of the lanes. He is holding a fancy black-and-red leather ball satchel (perhaps a Sylvia Wein). Behind him stands his partner, O'Brien, a short fat Irishman with tufted red hair.",
    "391": "Lebowski stares at him, dumbstruck. The Dude is encouraged. The Dude takes a hurried sip from his drink. Brandt is handing him a letter-sized envelope which is distended by something inside. The Dude, frowning, untucks its flap, takes out some cotton wadding and unrolls it. The wadding, undone, reveals a smaller wad of gauze taped up inside. The Dude undoes the tape with his fingernails and starts to unroll the inner package. Between thumb and forefinger the Dude holds up the contents of the package--a little toe, with emerald green nail polish. The Dude and Walter sit at the counter, both staring off into space, both absently stirring their coffee with little clinking noises. A waitress enters. The Dude has left frame; Walter calls after him. He looks defiantly around. A dripping noise. The Dude sits in the bathtub, staring stuporously, a joint pinched in one hand, a washcloth draped over his head. The Dude is staring at his toes, which protrude from the soapy water, splayed against the far side of the tub. After the Dude's outgoing message we hear. The Dude looks stuporously up, his head swaying. One of them holds a string at the other end of which a small animal skitters excitedly about the floor. Two other men are entering behind him. The Dude looks curiously at the small, nattering animal. The man with the string scoops up the marmot and tosses it, screaming, into the bathtub. The Dude screams. The marmot splashes frantically, biting at the Dude in a frenzy of fearful aggression. The three men turn to leave. They have reached the Dude's car. The driver's side exterior has been scraped raw. The policeman hands the Dude a door handle and an exterior rear-view mirror. The policeman laughs, agreeing broadly. The Dude looks sadly through his window at the policeman rocking back on his heels, his raucous laughter muffled by the glass. The Dude, Walter and Donny sit at the bar, the Dude with a White Russian, Walter with a beer, and Donny eating beer nuts. Walter sadly shakes his head. They leave the Dude sitting morosely at the bar. As he stares. He is middle-aged, amiable, craggily handsome--Sam Elliot, perhaps. He has a large Western-style mustache and wears denims, a yoked shirt and a cowboy hat. We recognize the voice of The Stranger whose narration opened the movie. The Stranger nods. Waiting for his drink, he looks amiably around the bar. His crinkled eyes settle on the Dude. The Dude, still staring down at his drink, shakes his head. The Dude looks at The Stranger as if just now noticing how out of place the cowpoke is. The Stranger chuckles indulgently and pushes off from the bar.",
    "392": "He is gone. She strides toward us, naked under a robe which she is just cinching shut. The Dude stops between two albums. The Dude pulls out an album with a worn sleeve. On it is the group's name, Autobahn, the album name, Nagelbett, and a picture of three young Germans, their foreheads looming below slicked-back hair, gazing upward in thin-lipped epiphany. They are wearing severe but modishly retro suits. A bed of nails is the only set dressing on the cover. The Dude and Walter are pulling up in front of a dilapidated house sitting on a scrubby lot. Parked incongruously in front of the house is a brand new red Corvette. It is opened by a matronly Spanish woman. Larry, a fifteen-year-old, looks at the two men. Walter pops the latches on his attache case and takes out the homework, which is now in a ziploc bag. He holds it out at arm's length, displaying it to Larry. Walter is still holding out the homework. Throughout Walter has been staring at Larry with the homework extended towards him. As he shoves the homework back in the attache case. He is heading for the door. Walter is striding down the lawn with his attache case like an enraged encyclopedia salesman. Without looking back at, the Dude, who follows. He pops the Dude's trunk, flings in the briefcase and takes out a tire iron. CRASH! He swings the crowbar into the windshield, which shatters. CRASH! He takes out the driver's window. Lights are going on in houses down the street. A man in a sleeveless T-shirt and boxer shorts has run over behind Walter and grabbed him from behind on a backswing of the crowbar. He wrestles the crowbar away from the startled Walter. He finishes hammering, rises and grabs a straightbacked chair that stands nearby. When the door is opened--outwards, The chair clatters to the floor. Out of the blackness something is falling toward us. It is a woman, falling in slow motion, her limbs flailing, her mouth contorted by either fear or ecstasy. She is topless. She falls past the camera, leaving blackness, then after a beat reappears, rising into the night sky. A crowd of mostly tanned middle-aged men with blow-dried hair, wearing jogging outfits and other expensively casual attire, are blanket-tossing the squealing young woman in nightmarish slow motion. It is a party, lit by festive beach lights and standing kerosene heaters. A man walks towards the camera through the pools of beach light. He is handsome, fiftyish, wearing cotton twill pants and a Turnbull & Asher shirt with a foulard knotted at the neck. Behind him, the woman rises and falls, appears and disappears.",
    "393": "The Dude is looking around at the '60's modern decor. He hands him the drink. He taps his forehead with one finger. Treehorn waves this off. He is getting to his feet, but sways woozily. He is joined on either side by Woo and the blond man, all three men looking grimly down at the Dude. He tips forward, spilling his drink off the table. He squints at Jackie Treehorn, who swims in and out of focus. Tied the room together. Looking up at the Dude as his face hits the glass and squishes. The title logo is a suggestively upright bowling pin flanked by a pair of bowling balls. The Dude's face is washed with a brilliant light as the corridor opens onto a gleaming bowling alley. In the center of the alley stands Maude Lebowski, singing operatic harmony to the Kenny Rogers song. She wears an armored breastplate and Norse headgear, has braided pigtails, and holds a trident. The Dude stands behind her and, pressed up against her, helps her with her follow-through as she releases a bowling ball. The lane is straddled by a line of chorines in spangly mini-skirts, their arms akimbo, Busby-Berkley style, their legs turning the lane into a tunnel leading to the pins at the end. But it is no longer a bowling ball rolling between their legs--it is the Dude himself, levitating inches off the lane, the tools from his utility belt swinging free. He is face down, his arms, torpedolike, pressed against his sides. The Dude twists his body around, performing a barrel-roll so that he is now gliding along the lane face-up. Now his point of view looks up the dresses of the passing chorines. The Dude smiles dreamily and does a backstroke motion so that he is once again gliding face-down. He looks forward and his forward momentum blows back his hair. Coming at us, as we go through the last few pairs of legs, are the approaching pins. We hit the pins, scattering them, and rush on into black. A body drops down into the blackness in slow motion--a topless woman, squealing, her legs kicking. As she drops out of frame, leaving blackness again, three men are entering from the background, emerging into a pool of light. It is the Germans, advancing ominously, wielding oversized shears which they menacingly scissor. The Dude, now standing in a field of black, reacts to the advancing Germans. He turns and runs, fists pumping. The field of black is punctured by headlights. The Dude is running blearily down the middle of the Pacific Coast Highway. Cars rush by on either side, horns blaring. With the BLOO-WHUP of a short siren blast, a squad car with flashing gumballs pulls up.",
    "396": "She goes inside; he follows. She downs a drink and motions for another. There are tears streaming down her face. He takes his hand and begins to wipe her face. She sits down; he joins her. He wipes the tears from her face with a tissue then dabs the tissue in her drink and wipes some more. Dil's face, staring at him. She allows herself to be led out. Dil and Fergus walking. Fergus stops her by the window. They walk inside. Dil and Fergus standing in the darkness. He sits her down in one of the chairs. Dil nods. Fergus takes up a scissors to snip at her hair. Her head leaps back. She stares at him. She takes a breath. Fergus begins to cut. CLOSE-UP ON DIL'S FACE as her hair is shorn. Tears stream down her cheeks. She looks in the mirror at it in the dark. Dil enters, with her new haircut. She goes to turn on the light. He stops her hand. She looks at her hand on his. Her fingers close around his. She brings her lips to his neck. He lets them stay there. His hands travel up to her blouse. He begins to undo the buttons. He raises her to her feet and leads her toward the bed. She stretches languorously down on it. She turns on the bed sexily, her face to the mattress. She is wearing suspender-belts underneath her skirt. But Fergus stands and walks quietly over to the wardrobe where the soldier's things are. Dil on the bed, slowly turns. We see Fergus from her point of view, coming toward her with Jody's white cricket shirt, glowing eerily in the dark. Fergus draws her slowly up to a standing position. He wraps the shirt around her. She kisses him. Fergus leading Dil, dressed in Jody's cricket clothes, down the street and inside. From above, we see the figures of Fergus and Dil, sleeping on a double bed, both fully clothed. Fergus smokes, then puts out the cigarette. The light gradually fills the room. Fergus wakes. Looks at the bedside clock, and very gingerly rises, puts on his coat, and walks out. A car pulls up at the site. Jude gets out. She has a satchel in her hand. Fergus looking down a ladder-staircase at Jude. Fergus climbs down a ladder to Jude; she hands him something from the bag. She kisses him. Fergus looks at her expressionlessly. Fergus opens what Jude has given him--looking inside. There is a gun wrapped in an oilcloth. Fergus enters. The room is empty. He calls. He runs outside. Fergus looks up at her building, but the lights are off in her flat. The sound of feet behind him.",
    "399": "She is screaming and the room is alive, each man awake, grabbing guns, screaming. She takes in huge gobs of air. She rubs her hand on his chest. She sidles closer, coming on to him. Fergus walks over to him, lifts the hood up so his mouth is revealed, and pushes the sandwich toward his lips. Jody eats, slowly. Fergus pushes the last crumbs of the sandwich toward Jody's mouth. Jody eats the last bits. Jude makes her way from the door toward the greenhouse. She is carrying a pot of tea and two cups. It is sweltering now in the greenhouse. The hood is drenched with sweat. Jude comes into view. Lays the tea on the ground. His breathing becomes labored. Fergus gives her the gun. Jody's head follows Fergus while he leaves. Jude smiles, holding the gun on her lap. Fergus enters. Maguire has a newspaper, which has a headline regarding the kidnapping. Jude, drinking tea, looking at Jody sweating. Fergus enters. She goes. Fergus walks to Jody and slowly takes the hood off. Jody looks up at him, his face bathed in sweat. He breathes in mighty gulps of air. He smiles. Fergus smiles. Fergus pours out a cup of tea and brings it to his lips. Fergus drinks. Fergus looks at him. Jody isn't smiling anymore. Fergus goes back to his seat and drinks his tea. He fingers the gun on his lap. He looks at Fergus. Fergus holds the gun to his face. He fishes inside Jody's inside pocket. Fergus's hand emerges with a wallet. Credit cards, army identification photograph. Fergus takes out a picture. It is of Jody, in cricket whites, smiling, holding a bat. Fergus smiles. Fergus takes out another picture of Jody and of a beautiful black woman, smiling. Jody chuckles. Fergus looks at him. He keeps looking at him. Jody smiles. Fergus leads Jody outside, holding the gun against him. He walks toward it, breathing heavily. Fergus, in the dark, stands motionless, looking at him. Fergus turns him around and unzips his fly. Jody takes two steps toward the wall. Fergus holds his hands from behind, so Jody can lean forward. Jody now pisses with immense relief. He shakes his body. He steps back. Fergus leads him back toward the greenhouse. Fergus leads Jody back to his chair. He begins to laugh. Fergus begins to laugh, without knowing why. Maguire, walking out of the house, woken by the sound of laughter. Jody, still laughing. Suddenly the hood is slammed back over his head. Maguire, standing there in the dark, looking at Fergus. Fergus gets up slowly, walks toward the door. Maguire sitting with an Armalite in his hands, watching him. The sun coming up over the low hills around the farmhouse.",
    "4": "He passes her the joint, then takes the Digicam and focuses it on her. We see her image on the TV as he videotapes. Jane looks into the camera, a loopy, stoned grin on her face. They LAUGH. She lays back on the bed. Her mind wanders for a beat. Jane looks at him and sits up. She smiles dreamily at him. He turns the Digicam off and the TV screen goes BLUE. He lowers the camera and looks at her intently. He puts the Digicam down and joins Jane on the bed. A long moment where neither of them speaks. He caresses her hair, gazing into her eyes. We're FLYING above Robin Hood Trail. We see the BURNHAM'S HOUSE below us as we APPROACH it steadily. We're almost on top of the Burnham house now, as Lester, wearing sweatpants and running shoes, bursts out of the front door and dashes up the driveway. We're now at street level, as Lester runs toward us. He's in excellent shape; even his posture has changed, and he moves with the confident, easy swagger of an athlete. The endorphins have kicked in, and Lester grins, reveling in the sheer physical pleasure of his body. The blender GRINDS as Lester, still in his sweatpants, makes himself a high-protein shake. Jane watches him blankly from the kitchen table. Carolyn enters. Lester leans against the counter, drinking his shake directly from the blender pitcher, eyeing her. He's got a newfound sexual energy that makes her uncomfortable, and he knows it. Carolyn quickly rinses off her coffee cup, avoiding his eyes, and starts out. Jane looks at Lester to see how he reacts. And she's gone. Jane continues staring at her father. Finally, he glances over at her. Jane is stunned. She quickly rises, trying to get out of the kitchen before she starts crying. ANGLE on Lester, and the immediate regret in his eyes. We're outside Ricky's room, MOVING slowly toward the open door, through which we can see Ricky, standing at his bureau mirror, combing his hair. The scars on his face are almost gone now. A REVERSE ANGLE reveals the Colonel standing outside the door looking in, watching Ricky with great tenderness. Then Ricky looks up at him, and the Colonel is suddenly self-conscious. Ricky emerges from the house, followed by the Colonel, who watches his son as he heads toward the Burnham house. Carolyn waves from the Mercedes, flashing an insincere smile. Jane leans forward from the passenger seat and glares at us. As Ricky starts to get in the car, Lester emerges from the house in his sweatpants. The Colonel watches, at first baffled, then impatient. CLOSE on the Colonel's face: he looks confused.",
    "400": "Fergus enters, with a tray and some breakfast. Maguire is sitting where he sat before, stock-still. Maguire shakes his head. Maguire shakes his head. Maguire looks hard at him. He rises, and drags Fergus out the door. Maguire goes back to the house. Jody is sitting with the hood on again. Fergus enters. Fergus says nothing. He takes a plate and brings it toward Jody. Fergus lifts up Jody's hood to expose his mouth and begins to feed him. Fergus says nothing and keeps feeding him. Fergus shakes his head and says nothing. He eats. Fergus feeds himself, then feeds more to Jody. Fergus says nothing. Jody chuckles under his hood. Fergus walks toward him and pulls off the hood. Jody smiles up at him. Fergus laughs. She pulls the hood down over him. She whacks him with a pistol. Fergus lifts it a bit; Jody's mouth, with blood now in his lips. Fergus is moved. Fergus walks toward him. Their faces, close to each other as Fergus searches out her picture. The door opens. Maguire is there, with another. Fergus turns toward him. Fergus walks toward Maguire and the other man walks forward, takes his seat. Maguire, Jude, Fergus, and the others. Maguire lights a cigarette. Fergus looks at him and nods. He turns back to Fergus. Fergus leaves. Fergus takes his place in the chair beside Jody. Jody begins to laugh under the hood. Fergus takes out a cigarette, lights it, and lifts up Jody's hood so he can smoke. Fergus watches him puff the cigarette, the hood just above his lips. Jody coughs, but keeps the cigarette in his lips. Fergus gently takes the cigarette from his mouth. Fergus is silent; his eyes wet. The farmhouse covered in mist. Maguire opens the door to the greenhouse and clicks the chamber of his gun. Fergus has a gun in his hand. Fergus takes Jody, whose hands are still tied behind his back, by the elbow. Jody rises. Fergus leads him through the door, past Maguire. Fergus turns with sudden fierceness. He pulls Jody through the fields. Fergus pushing Jody through a copse of trees, the gun at his back. Fergus pulls the hood off. Jody looks around him. He has a cut lip where Jude struck him. Fergus prods him on with the gun. Jody stumbles forward. Fergus is all cold and businesslike. Jody suddenly sprints, and, loosening the ties on his hands, then freeing them, he is off like a hare. Fergus screams in fury after him. Fergus aims, then changes his mind and runs. Fergus gains on him--stretches his arm out--but Jody sprints ahead again--as if he has been playing with him. He laughs in exhilaration. Fergus pants behind him, wheezing, almost laughing.",
    "407": "His eyes open suddenly. PULL BACK SLOWLY from a CLOSEUP of a television screen with snow on it to reveal a long row of television sets along the ceiling of the aircraft. PULL BACK from the CLOSEUP of Ben to reveal a row of passengers staring straight ahead, their headsets on. Ben has not moved. Now the bed on which he is lying moves as though someone has sat down upon it next to him. As Ben says this, the door to the bedroom opens and MRS. BRADDOCK looks in. They move out of the door, Mr. Braddock steering Ben. PHIL and MIMI CARLSON are coming up the stairs as the Braddocks are moving down. Mrs. Carlson gives Ben a broad wink. Ben tries to smile and return the wink politely. They reach the hall at the bottom of the stairs. Ben moves to the front door and opens it. MR. LOOMIS steps into the house and grabs Ben's hand. Mr. Loomis closes the door and pushes Ben back down the hall. Mr. Loomis turns and goes into the dining room. Ben moves back to the stairway as THREE LADIES come out of the living room. One lady takes Ben's right hand, another lady his left, the third fingers the front of his jacket. MR. MCQUIRE appears behind Ben. They look at each other for a moment. Mr. McQuire turns and walks back into the house. The people at the other end of the yard look toward Ben. Ben goes into the house through the back door. We can see through the windows of the house, Ben making his way through people trying to stop him and speak to him as he goes through rooms, up the stairs and to his room. SOUND of a door SLAMMING. Ben stands with his back against the door. LONG SHOT Over Ben to pool area and people below. SOUND of the door OPENING. Ben turns. MRS. ROBINSON enters the room. They stand for a moment, looking at each other. Mrs. Robinson moves into the room and sits on the edge of the bed. Mrs. Robinson takes a cigarette from her purse and lights it. She blows out the match and puts it down carefully on the bedspread. Ben picks up a wastebasket, walks over to the bed, picks up the match and puts it in the wastebasket. Ben reaches into his pocket and hands Mrs. Robinson a set of car keys. Mrs. Robinson looks at him. Mrs. Robinson shakes her head. She throws the keys to him. Ben gets out and goes around to her side and opens the door. They move to the door. She takes out her key and opens the door.",
    "408": "Ben and Elaine are walking along in front of one of the outside animal cages. Ben is walking a step or two behind Elaine. Carl strides up to them. He takes the pipe out of his mouth and puts it in his pocket. He reaches out and takes Elaine's hands. Carl frowns and looks up over Elaine's shoulder at Ben. Ben smiles. Ben steps forward and grasps Carl's hand. Carl steps back and puts an arm around Elaine's shoulder. The three of them look at each other for a moment. There is another KNOCK. Elaine is standing in the hall. Ben nods. Ben moves in behind her and puts his hand on her arm. Several BOYS are gathering in the hallway trying to see into the room. Ben edges through the door into the hallway. He opens the door a little way. They all try to see in. The boys start back to their rooms. Mr. McCleery and Ben stand and look at each other for a few seconds. Mr. McCleery turns away and walks down the hall and starts down the stairs. Ben turns and goes back into the room. Elaine sits in the chair. She watches him as he goes to the bureau, takes some shirts from a drawer and puts them in the suitcase, then goes back to the bureau. He gets down on his knees and looks under the bureau. He goes back to the bureau, gets some socks and underwear and carries them to the suitcase. He goes back to the bureau, opens a drawer, takes out some T-shirts and the beer can and carries them to the suitcase. Elaine gets up, goes to the door and opens it. She walks out, shutting the door behind her. He crosses to the window. Past Ben, through the window, we see Elaine walking away. She walks the length of the street and disappears. Ben asleep in his bed. Suddenly he sits up. Standing in the darkness by the door. He gets out of the bed. He goes to her and they kiss. She shakes her head. She nods. She goes to the door. She opens the door and steps into the hall. He goes to the door. Students are moving quickly from building to building. Ben is walking alongside Elaine. They move up the steps of a classroom building. Ben pushes through a lot of students to keep up with Elaine. They walk down a corridor. On each side are open doors to classrooms with students filing into each of them. Elaine turns into one of the doors. Ben is left in the hall. All the doors in the classrooms close. He leans against the wall.",

They look at each other. Ben is half standing. He puts his hand up and retreats around the other side of the chair. She looks at him. We move with Mrs. Robinson and Ben out of the sunroom, into the hall, up the stairs and along the hall to the doorway to Elaine's room. Ben moves into the room and looks up at the portrait. In the background Mrs. Robinson watches him. He steps back. She turns her back. Ben reaches forward and pulls the zipper down. Mrs. Robinson lets her dress fall to the floor. Benjamin walks out of the door and down the hall. The camera pushes with him to the door. We see the entire stairway and part of the downstairs hall. Ben gets to the stairs and starts down. She walks out of the shot. Ben starts back up the stairs. Ben appears as he slowly climbs the stairs. Ben gets to the top of the stairs, and starts slowly down the hall. Ben walks quickly into Elaine's room, crosses to the bed and puts the purse down. As he starts to turn back, he looks up at Elaine's portrait. There is a movement reflected in the glass of the portrait. He turns quickly. Mrs. Robinson, naked, is shutting the door to the bedroom behind her. She smiles. Ben leaps at the door, pushes Mrs. Robinson aside, struggles with the door, gets the door open, runs into the hall and down the stairs. Ben rushes into the sunroom and sits down. Ben jumps up, gets the glass he had been drinking from and sits down again. Sound of the front door opening and closing. Footsteps approach the sunroom. Mr. Robinson enters. Mr. Robinson reaches for Ben's glass. Mr. Robinson takes the glass from him. Mr. Robinson turns his back to Ben to mix the drinks. Mr. Robinson turns and brings him the drink. Ben shakes his head. Ben nods. Mrs. Robinson enters the room. She is now wearing the dress she wore earlier. Ben starts to get up. Ben sits. Mrs. Robinson nods. He stands. Mr. Robinson stands up with him. They start out of the sunroom. Ben nods. Ben continues to walk toward us. The sun shines brightly. Standing and sitting around the pool are Mr. and Mrs. Braddock, their friends Mr. and Mrs. Arnold, and the Arnold children, Peter and Louise, who are eight or nine. Watching from across the fence on one side of the house: the young girl from next door and her boyfriend.",
    "414": "Ben watches it. Ben's face, watching. Ben watching. PULL BACK and we are in the Taft Hotel Room. Ben is sitting on the bed, leaning against the headboard, watching the television set which is on a stand facing the bed. PULL BACK to a WIDE SHOT of the room, lit only by the light from the television set. Mrs. Robinson walks into the shot, half dressed. She passes between Ben and the television set and goes out of frame. Ben continues to stare at the set. Mrs. Robinson appears again and passes the other way. Mrs. Robinson passes back the other way again. Mrs. Robinson, now fully dressed and carrying her purse, passes through again and, without looking at Ben, goes to the door of the hotel room, opens it and exits. SOUND of DOOR closing. Follow Ben as he gets up and moves to the windows of what is now his BEDROOM in the Braddock house. He opens the closed blinds over the window. The sun is bright outside. His bathing suit is on the window sill. He takes the suit and puts it on. He moves to the bedroom door, opens it and goes out. We see Mrs. Braddock in the kitchen. Ben comes through the back door, moves to the pool and dives in. The raft floats in the center of the pool. Ben swims toward us the length of the pool. Ben surfaces and, in one movement, pulls himself up on the raft and lands on top of Mrs. Robinson on the bed. He stays on top of her for a moment. Ben turns toward us and looks. Mr. Braddock standing by the side of the pool. The sun is behind him. Mrs. Braddock steps in beside Mr. Braddock. Mr. Robinson steps in beside the others. They blot out the sun. Mrs. Robinson steps in beside them. A long pause. The door opens and Mrs. Robinson enters. She stops. She looks at him. Mrs. Robinson looks at him and raises her eyebrows. Ben thinks for a moment. Ben looks at her. She pulls the covers down. He starts putting on his shirt. She sits on the edge of the bed and watches him. She shakes her head. There is another long pause. At opposite sides of the room, without looking at each other, they begin to take off their clothes. Ben sits at the table, eating his breakfast and looking at the back of a cereal box. Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are there. Benjamin looks at his father for a moment, then continues eating and reading. He slides off the raft and goes underwater. His hair streaming up, his eyes open. Mr. Robinson turns toward the sunroom.",
    "418": "Eddie leaves the car parked at the gas station and heads for the bar. Armstead's is a typical small town pool hall. It has a bar, a short order counter, a skee-ball machine, and pool tables for small, friendly games. The few people in Armstead's this day are not playing; they sit and read the papers. Charlie and Eddie are at the bar, drinking straight bourbon. Charlie rises from his barstool. Eddie is already at the table. Charlie joins Eddie. The game is in mid-progress. It's Eddie's shot. He downs his bourbon, weaves a bit, bends over the table, and awkwardly pokes at the white cue ball with his stick, missing an easy shot. Several more townspeople have come in from the street and are following the play. The bartender refills the glasses as soon as they are emptied. Two balls lay side by side on the table. Eddie peers at them, trying to figure his shot, blinking his eyes to focus better. Some of the onlookers seem skeptical. But Eddie pats the corner pocket confidently, leans over, and raps out his shot. The ball banks in. He pounds his pal Charlie on the shoulder and collapses into a nearby chair. Stung, Eddie lies across the table and sets them up himself. They toss their money on the table, and Eddie shoots, but his shot is too hard and his ball leaps over the side of the table. The bartender cannot contain his staccato laughter. Eddie pauses, smiling. Sheepishly, the bartender replaces the balls in their original positions. Eddie chalks up his cue, waiting impatiently for the bartender to return with the money from the cash register. Then he downs his drink and quickly strokes out his shot, the ball banking crisply and directly into the corner pocket. There is a cocky leer on his face as he reaches for the dollar bills. The door of the Packard coupe slams shut. Eddie Felson holds up his stuffed billfold for his pal, Charlie Burns, to see. He tosses it on the seat beside him and turns on the ignition. Henry nods, then steps up on a stool to fix the minute hand of the clock. It now stands at ten o'clock. It is twelve-thirty when Eddie Felson and Charlie Burns first enter into Ames. Only one table is in use; the hall is empty. In Eddie's hand is his leather cue case. They stand before the swinging doors and look around. They saunter over to the cashier's cage. A sign on the brass bar reads NO GAMBLING ALLOWED. Eddie's arrival is noted by Big John and Preacher, a gambler and an addict, who hang out at Ames at all hours, waiting for action.",
    "42": "Who, like everyone else, leave the table and stand together at the rail watching. She rises on tip-toes and kisses him gently; his only reaction is to look at her. She kisses him again. He responds a little better. She starts to kiss him again, but he stops her. He hangs up, swings his feet out of bed and spears his slippers, reaching for his robe at the same time. Then he shuffles sleepily to the door. As GIDEON comes out of his room and goes to the elevator. The cage is there. He opens the door and enters. GIDEON closes the sliding grill and presses a button. The cage starts down. GIDEON begins sneezing. Suddenly the elevator stops between floors and the lights go out. Just as suddenly the lights go back on and the elevator starts moving down again. GIDEON shakes his head and leans back, whistling again. The cage comes to his floor and starts past it. Seeing this, GIDEON looks confused. The NIGHT PORTER is asleep behind the desk. The elevator, GIDEON inside, keeps coming down. It passes the lobby level and keeps right on going, toward the basement. The elevator passes out of sight, still going down. There is a silence as the motor stops, and then a series of sneezes that ends with a terrifying shriek. The NIGHT PORTER, rudely awakened, runs to the elevator shaft, his shoes squeaking horribly. He looks up, sees nothing, then looks down. He presses the call button and the motor starts. An instant later the cage appears and stops. The NIGHT PORTER opens the gate, pulls back the grill and the CAMERA RUSHES PAST him to pick up GIDEON. His body is sitting on the floor of the cage, its grotesque sprawling attitude resembling a puppet's with its strings cut. Except that GIDEON has no strings to cut -- only a throat. From ear to ear. CLOSE SHOT -- GRANDPIERRE. He is now doubly apoplectic. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal REGGIE and ADAM, in their bathrobes. REGGIE shrugs. REGGIE and ADAM exchange looks. GRANDPIERRE turns and leaves. REGGIE and ADAM start down the hall toward their own rooms. ADAM, before hanging up, reflects on TEX's words, then looks behind him. Smiling softly, he hangs up the phone and starts for REGGIE's door. REGGIE slips back into her robe and goes to the connecting door. She undoes the bolt and opens the door. ADAM enters. He takes the bag to the bed where he dumps out the contents. As ADAM begins to examine the items one by one. He takes it out of the envelope and takes out his glasses before reading it. He hands her the glasses and she looks through them.",
    "422": "The Kentucky-bound train rolls down the track. Bert and Eddie finish their breakfast coffee in the dining room. Sarah is in the washroom. Sarah makes her way down the aisle and joins them at the table. She stands there, lips pursed, absorbing the insult. Bert gets up and reaches in his pocket for his billfold. Eddie and Sarah just stare at him. They are at a table, sipping drinks. Bert shuffles a deck of cards as he talks. Eddie, like a schoolboy, listens intently. Sarah sits apart, watching them both. Eddie glances at Sarah who stares mutely at Bert. Eddie reaches across to light Bert's cigarette with the lighter Sarah gave him. Bert's own lighter is on the table, before him. Sarah sees it, picks it up, and sparks it into flame. Bert goes back to shuffling his deck of cards. The lobby is thronged with gamblers and their women, sportsmen, tourists, all there for the Derby. A jazz combo can be heard over the din of their voices. Eddie, looking excited, leads Sarah through the crowd. Behind them is Bert, his face now shaded by dark glasses, following a bellhop to the main desk. He forces his way through some people to get to the desk. Bert displays a neatly folded wad of money in his hand. Eddie laughs and moves toward the open door leading to the billiard rooms. His face glows as he watches the flow of men moving in and out of the crowded room, and hears the sound of clicking pool balls. He tucks his cue case under his arm and turns to Bert and Sarah who join him. Sarah turns toward the elevators, with Bert behind her, jiggling his keys. The bellboy unlocks the door and Sarah enters. The doors to the other suite are open. As she catches sight of Bert arranging things with the bellboy she closes one door. The bellboy leaves as she moves to close the other. He comes to the door, holding it open. He turns away. There is a long pause as he glares at her. He goes back into his room. She closes the door and leans against it. Screams are heard as the horses jerk out of the starting gate to begin their runs. Eddie cashes in a winning ticket. Eddie moves through the ornate racetrack bar to join Sarah at a table. Sarah has been drinking. As she puts the money in her purse, Bert sits down. We see Findley, studying his program and holding a drink in his hand. He is tall and refined, with a pale, debauched, yet oddly youthful face that some men of forty or more sometimes have. A cork-tipped cigarette dangles from his fingers.",
    "427": "Eddie takes his cue ball from the cashier's cage and heads for a table. As he passes Charlie, he mimics the cashier wickedly. The two go to a table. Eddie selects a house cue, then rolls it over the table top to test the roll. He seems pleased. He runs his hand over the green felt as if he were caressing it. His last test is to sweep the cue ball into the corner pocket. Eddie takes some balls out of the return box and throws them on the table. But Big John and Preacher lean forward in their chairs to listen in. Big John, stubbly cigar between his fingers, drifts over to their table. As Big John walks off, Eddie smiles at Charlie. Eight sharp. A departing customer holds the door for an incoming one: Minnesota Fats. Heads turn when he makes his punctual appearance. Fats' clothes reflect his high station at Ames Pool Hall: a gray felt bowler hat, and an expensive, tailored overcoat, with a carnation in its lapel and two silk handkerchiefs peeking up from its breast pocket. He moves like a sultan through the room, past Big John, whose eyes dip significantly, and over to the coat rack, where Henry respectfully takes his coat and hat. The buzzard-like eyes of the cashier direct his gaze toward Eddie's table. Fats withdraws a cigarette from his gold case, then casually strolls toward Eddie's table standing apart and quietly observing the sharp, precise movements of his prospective opponent. Even though Ames is filled with players, there is little noise other than the clicking of pool balls. Fats and Eddie regard each other with amusement, sharing the private joke of pool hustlers. At his command, Ames comes to life. Players drag their chairs across the floor and position them around the main table. Eddie, hand to his mouth, realizes that the big moment has arrived and beckons to Charlie for his leather cue case. The uniformed maids withdraw the cover off the green felt top, and Sausage, the racker, begins to bang the balls into the wooden racking triangle. Fats is in the washroom, scrubbing his hands and nails. Eddie stands and screws together his inlaid, ivory-pointed cue as Fats dries his hands. He and Fats eye one another. Henry helps Fats on with his coat. Fats carefully extends his palms so that Henry may sprinkle on some talcum powder. Sausage finishes racking. They are ready to start. Fats, immaculate in jacket and tie, tosses a wad of bills -- his stake money -- onto the table. Charlie does the same, counting the bills out one by one. Willie takes the money. Two balls are rolled to the end of the table, and Fats and Eddie, like two duelers, prepare to shoot for the break.",
    "43": "He shakes some powder into his hand and tastes it. REGGIE watches expectantly. The ultra-modern glass and concrete structure behind the Ecole Militaire. SEVERAL DELEGATES identified by little plaques in front of them listing their respective nations, and their AIDES, sit around the large table. They are all wearing earphones. The ITALIAN DELEGATE is speaking. SYLVIE jumps up and rushes next door into her booth, shutting the door after her. The BRITISH DELEGATE rises to speak, continuing through the next scene. He hands her a paper. The one GRANDPIERRE gave REGGIE. It has been torn in half and scotch-taped back together. She turns back to the conference, flips a switch and starts speaking into her headset. From REGGIE'S and ADAM'S ANGLE. All the DELEGATES and their AIDES suddenly turn, surprised, and look at CAMERA. From the DELEGATE'S ANGLE. Inside the booth, REGGIE and ADAM can be seen heading for the door in a hurry. As the DELEGATES look at one another, confused. By the locked gate. A quick succession of shots showing: 1.Children's Merry-go-round 2.Rond Point de Champs-Elysées with fountains playing 3.Children's swings 4.Restaurant Laurent 5.Balloon salesman. ADAM stands by the large fountain, staring off at something as REGGIE joins him. ADAM starts off. Between the curb and the Jardin, several temporary wooden booths have been set up. They have collected quite a CROWD. Into this area comes TEX, followed at a safe distance by ADAM. Suddenly TEX stops. As he stares wide-eyed at something. Neatly displayed on a counter of one of the booths. As he wheels to look at another booth. In another arrangement. He turns crazily to look at another booth, then another. Various FLASH SHOTS of stamps of all sizes, shapes and colors. As he understands. He turns to rush off and bumps smack into ADAM. TEX is startled. They go off in opposite directions. As she hurries along a row of stalls, weaving around small groups of MEN standing together, showing each other stamps. Searching in another section of the market. But it isn't. Looking everywhere. Suddenly she sees something. Only a small boy's elbow and part of his arm show, the rest hidden by all the legs. She recognizes him from these fragments. She rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him. REGGIE runs up and joins them. JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember. Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. As REGGIE comes hurrying up the stairs. She goes first to ADAM's room and knocks. BARTHOLOMEW, his face lathered for a shaving, is on the phone.",
    "430": "Eddie walks over to the water cooler. Charlie gets Eddie a bottle. Bert and Henry watch Eddie coldly. A drunken, exhausted Eddie nods, looks up at Bert, grins maliciously, and takes a drink. Eddie's face is buried in his lap as Charlie massages his back. Behind him, in the washroom, is Fats, washing his face and hands. Charlie starts to put away Eddie's cue stick. Fats emerges from the washroom, dries his hands, looks at Eddie and then at Bert who nods. Henry helps Fats into the jacket with the carnation still in the lapel. Eddie grins at this. So does Bert. Fats opens his palms for the sprinkling of the talcum powder. Fats rubs his hands together, then takes out his cigarette case. Bert smiles in appreciation. Eddie grabs the leather case out of Charlie's hands. Eddie rises and confronts Fats almost scornfully. Eddie looks down at his own dirty, disheveled shirt. He and a smiling Bert exchange glances. Eddie moves to put on his jacket. Charlie confronts him. Eddie puts a bottle into the pocket of his jacket and returns to the table to screw together his cue stick. The sight of Fats makes him laugh again. Everyone stares at Eddie as he scratches his head, alone with his private joke. Eddie abruptly tosses his cue case away. A worried Charlie picks up the case and stands by mutely, watching Eddie disintegrate. Eddie leans over to shoot, then turns away, laughing loudly to himself. Fats watches him, soberly, patiently. A high angle. Fats is shooting. Eddie is asleep on a stool against a wall. Even Bert is dozing. The shots go in. Eddie bangs his head against the wall. He knocks over a bottle as he tries to get up off the stool. The noise startles him. Charlie watches sadly. Eddie gropes through his pockets and comes up with a few crumpled bills. Fats rises and tosses his cue on the table. Willie gives him the stake money. Fats confronts Eddie. Fats steps by Eddie and heads for the coat rack, slapping the stake money into Bert's hand as he goes by. Bert returns the money to his billfold, wordlessly. The blinds are drawn and the light strikes Eddie in the eyes, but still he stumbles after Fats, holding his money out before him, pleading. He bangs against the corner of the table and falls onto the floor. Fats hears him go down and pauses, turning to see Charlie rush to Eddie's side. After a moment, Fats continues on toward the door. Charlie slaps Eddie's cheeks. Bert, Sausage, Willie, Preach step around the body on their way out. Eddie is lying on his bed staring at the ceiling, the crashing of pool balls sounding in his head.",
    "432": "She looks at Eddie anxiously as she digs in her purse for the coins. She pays, collects her purse and book, and rises to leave. The public address system bleats over the noise of the crowded luncheonette. The waitress leans over and slaps Eddie on the shoulder. He wakes up with a cramped neck. The bar is nearly empty when Eddie comes in. As he looks around the bar he sees Sarah, alone at a back booth, sipping a highball. She seems amused by their encounter. He takes his drink and joins her at the booth. Sarah nods. There is a long pause as she tries to read his face. Eddie finishes his drink, rises, crosses to the bar, pays the bill, and returns to the booth. As they go out, Sarah stumbles, and he catches her by the arm. Eddie pauses a moment to register this as she limps off, then follows. Eddie goes into the liquor store. Sarah waits outside, stiff and uneasy. Then he comes out with the scotch and they walk off down the street together. They walk slowly, with their eyes pointed straight ahead. He tries to ignore her halting gait. They pass under the awning of the neighborhood's elegant Parisien restaurant. As she searches through her purse for her keys, he reaches out and puts his hand on her shoulder. She closes her eyes, then draws back against the door, fearful, like a threatened animal. He takes her head in his hands and kisses her. She responds but, as he holds her tighter, she starts to struggle. She pushes him away and shakes her head. They stand there for a long moment: she looks away; he looks down at the floor. Then Eddie takes the bag of scotch and places it underneath her arm. He leaves her there in the hall and walks off. A door opens. A hotel manager shows Eddie into a dingy, barely furnished room. He reaches in his pocket and pulls out some bills. Eddie removes his bags from the locker. The sight of the lunch counter reminds him of Sarah. But the lunchroom is empty; only the janitor is there, mopping up. Eddie picks up his bags and goes out. Eddie, on his way back to the hotel, stops at the same liquor store for a bottle. He enters his room, puts down his bags and the liquor, and sits on his rusted brass bed. From his pocket he pulls out the few crumpled bills he has left. He looks at the money, shakes his head disgustedly, and closes his eyes. It is a friendly, neighborhood bar for business people and cocktail drinkers. Eddie walks casually by the pool table and over to the bar.",
    "433": "He turns on his stool to watch the game. Eddie goes back to his bottle of beer. Some bills drop on a ragged, beat-up pool table. Two men, dressed in work clothes, stand around looking disgruntled. They go to the bar. Eddie sits at a table, smoking, waiting. The paper bag with the whisky is on the table. He mashes out his cigarette in the ashtray. Sarah, dressed in a dark suit, limps toward him. When he looks up, he sees Sarah standing nearby. She seems cold and suspicious as she limps toward the table. She pauses and looks at him. They stare at one another for a long moment. He gets up, puts his arm around her shoulder, and walks away with her. As they walk, she hesitantly puts an arm around his waist. A hand reaches up to open the wooden shutters. As they open, we see Eddie, in his underclothes, on the bed. Sarah, in a robe, walks up and joins him in bed as they both peer out the window. She hands him her cigarette. He starts to put on his wristwatch. He kisses her on the cheek. He kisses her again, this time on the lips. He reaches out and closes the shutters. Sarah emerges from a neighborhood grocery store loaded down with a Cheese Doodles carton full of food. A woman runs out of the store to give her a parcel she left behind. He pulls her schoolbooks out of the carton and takes her purse. She unloads liquor and canned goods from the carton, then goes to join Eddie by the window. Sarah takes a cigarette lighter out of her purse and hands it to Eddie. He takes it. She smiles, then she gets up and returns to the kitchenette. He comes up behind her and puts his arms around her. She cuts her hand opening a can. As he rummages through the closet for his bag he pulls out his leather cue case. They kiss. Someone knocks on the door. Sarah goes to open it. We stay on Eddie, who examines the lighter in his hand. He enters the room, awkwardly, toying with the rim of his hat. There is a long silence. Charlie sits. She starts to make the drinks. Eddie leans up against the wall, listening. Sarah watches them both, curious, confused. Suddenly Eddie becomes tense. Sarah turns to fix the drink. Eddie signals her to stay where she is. He moves forward, confronting Charlie. Eddie walks off. A tear rolls down Sarah's cheek as she hears this. She stands near the door, with her back to both of them. Charlie gets up and moves toward the door. Sarah, her cheek wet, says nothing.",
    "434": "Charlie puts on his hat and leaves. Eddie empties his glass and slaps it on the shelf next to Sarah. She pours it out, saying nothing. Sarah hands Eddie his drink without looking him in the eye. She pours herself a very stiff drink as Eddie moves about restlessly. Sarah drinks her drink. Still drinking, she turns to him. They embrace and kiss one another without putting down their glasses. The room is a mess and Sarah is drunk. She sits on her knees on the floor, pecking at the keys of her typewriter with one finger. Her bottle and her glass are beside her. A bare-chested Eddie is in the kitchen behind her, tossing empty cans and bottles from the sink into a garbage bag. He carelessly wipes the sink, then throws down the dishrag and goes to the closet, pulling out his leather case. Reaching for the bottle, Sarah abruptly lurches forward over her typewriter, and knocks the bottle over. Eddie stares at Sarah as she sways limply on her knees, unmindful of her open robe. Eddie picks up the bottle and sets it before her. Taking her ashtray, Eddie rises, runs his hand through her hair for a moment, and then carries off the ashtray and empties it in the garbage bag. Sarah, still hopelessly drunk, is sprawled out on her bed, futilely attempting to dial a telephone. Eddie, in a clean shirt and pants, watches her. He sets the bottle down near the typewriter and notices the sheet of paper stuck in the typewriter's carriage. He bends down to read it. She falls back on the bed. Eddie pulls the paper out of the carriage and reads it. He thinks for a moment, then angrily crumples the paper in his hands and throws it at her. Eddie walks off. Eddie gives her a look, then lowers his eyes. Eddie turns and slaps her on the cheek. He reaches for his jacket. As Eddie pushes through the glass doors to the front room of Johnny's bar. He looks around at the unused pool tables, then goes to the bar. A man in a business suit comes out of the back room and joins him at the bar. The man looks to the bartender for his answer. Eddie takes his beer to the back room. The poker game is in progress. Four men are playing. One of them is Bert Gordon. His glass of milk is beside him on the table. He takes note of Eddie's presence with a quick dart of his eyes. He takes a seat next to Bert. As the cards are dealt Eddie steals a glance at the man he has come to see.",
    "438": "THE CAMERA goes slowly up to a sidewalk clock with a diadem of three balls, which stands outside the hock shop. The time is twenty minutes of one. It says five minutes of four. Nat is at the bar. He and two or three customers are listening to race results on a little radio. Don drags himself in, drenched in sweat, his breath as short and agonized as that of a dying man. He goes to the end of the bar closest the door, hoists the typewriter on it with a final awful effort, leans his head on it. He shoves the drink at Don. Don is shaking so that he can't pick up the glass. He bends down, sucks half of it, then lifts the glass, drains the rest. He holds out the empty glass to Nat, his eyes imploring. Don takes the typewriter, drags himself out of Nat's place. Don emerges, starts dragging himself up the street towards home. As he passes the antique shop, suddenly he stops. There stands the wooden Indian Gloria spoke about, pointing up. Don walks into the house. Second floor, this same house. This is a really crummy Third Avenue house -- dark woodwork, paint peeling from the walls. Beside the door at the head of the stairs there are about three bells, for the several occupants of the apartment within. Don drags himself up the stairs, puts down the typewriter and inspects the name tags by the bells. Don rings the bell beside it. Don rings again. From inside comes. The door is opened by Gloria. She is wearing a dressing gown and bedroom slippers. Her hair is the ruined elaborate hairdress of yesterday, and her eyes are blazing with anger. She slips into the apartment, leaving the door about three inches a jar. After a couple of seconds Gloria reappears with a wallet. Don leans against the door jamb, breathing heavily. She takes five dollars out, gives it to him. Don takes it with a shaking hand. She brushes his forehead with the back of her hand. He takes her hand and kisses it. Gloria looks at him, then at her hand. He bends, picks up the typewriter and starts downstairs. Gloria looks after him. The man looks at Don but doesn't answer. The man stands staring at him, terrified. The man drifts away eerily. From the opposite direction comes a male nurse. He gets a pad and pencil from his pocket. Don has risen. He is wearing flannel pajamas like all the rest of the patients. Bim stands quietly watching him, a great big grin on his face. However he manages to make the swinging glass door. Along the walls are benches and a collection of wheel-chairs.",
    "44": "She hangs up, looks briefly at TEX's body, shudders, then hurries to the door. As REGGIE leaves her room and goes to the elevator. She presses the button, then notices it is in use. She goes to the stairs and starts down. Between the landings. The stairs curve around the open elevator shaft. As REGGIE comes down the stairs, the cage rises into view. Inside is ADAM. For a moment, she stops and their eyes meet. REGGIE starts running downstairs. ADAM pushes the emergency stop button and then starts the cage down. As REGGIE comes off the stairs, passes the elevator gate and starts down toward the lobby, the cage a few feet behind her. As REGGIE continues to run. Between the first landing and the lobby. REGGIE running, the elevator following. A taxi stands by the curb. REGGIE leaves the hotel and runs to it. ADAM tries to look past him, to see REGGIE, but gives it up and goes back toward the ticket booth, on the run. CAMERA LEADING REGGIE as she runs -- the passageway is nearly empty. Her footsteps echo against the tile and concrete walls. The jumble of advertising posters as it passes rapidly, forming a moving band of letters, women, cartoons and colors. REGGIE stops and pauses for a moment at a sign indicating two different directions, an arrow for each. CAMERA PANS SHARPLY, 180 degrees, to pick up ADAM rounding the corner in hot pursuit. REGGIE starts down the platform, looking behind her every few steps. Suddenly she looks up in surprise -- there, across the tracks on the opposite platform is ADAM. He has evidently made the wrong turn back in the passageway. They stare at each other for a moment. Then the bell rings, announcing the arrival of a train. ADAM turns, running back through the exit behind him. The approaching train can be heard. As the TRAIN pulls in and comes to a stop. The GENDARME opens the door for ADAM and escorts him out. ADAM turns once more to look at REGGIE as he goes. Moving quickly, he returns to the exit door and looks at the platform. From ADAM'S P.O.V. Featuring ADAM as he hurries from the car. He finds his way blocked by FIVE NUNS in large, white butterfly hats. It takes him a few precious seconds to work his way around them. He stands on the platform as the train doors slam shut, the latches click, the whistle blows and the train pulls out. He looks around in all directions, looking for some sign of REGGIE. As ADAM enters the deserted area. There is, miraculously, no sign of REGGIE. CAMERA PANS to a phone booth (solid door with a window in the upper half) and we see REGGIE's hand reaching up to dial a number.",
    "442": "Don has already reached the second floor and is hurrying down the stairs, the fur coat over his arm, not paying any attention to Helen. Don is just coming from it. He walks down the street about ten steps when Helen comes up to him. Don disregards her, tries to go on. Helen overtakes him and blocks his way. He goes on. Helen stands looking after him for a moment, then turns angrily and proceeds toward the pawn shop. The pawn broker has put Helen's coat on a hanger and is brushing it. Helen enters, very matter-of-fact. On it lies a revolver and the second page of a letter on which Don is writing. But amid all the grimness can we share one little joke, dear Wick: I did finish something, didn't I? Goodbye. He puts down the pen, gets up, stands the letter conspicuously on the desk, picks up the revolver, gets the cartridges from the drawer and loads the gun. As he has been out in the rain, his hair is still a little damp. Don is seated at the desk. With a last look at the room, he walks into the bathroom. Don stands and looks at himself in the mirror, the gun in his hand. He notices the unbuttoned points of his collar and with a rueful smile at the funny timing of his urge for tidiness, buttons one. As he is buttoning the second, there is a sound from outside. Startled, Don puts the gun into the empty wash bowl. The door is being opened. She looks around wildly. She is breathing hard from her race to get there. There is rain on her hair and her face, and her dress is wet. Don comes from the bathroom. Helen stands staring at him, wiping the rain from her face, and maybe some tears too. She stands looking about. He steps to the chest of drawers in the bedroom. Helen, looking around desperately, sees something reflected in the shaving mirror: THE GUN IN THE WASH BOWL. Before she can step toward it, Don is back with the scarf. Helen goes to the umbrella stand, takes out the bottle. She puts down the raincoat and the scarf and goes to the kitchen for a glass. He picks up the raincoat and the scarf. He bends down for a kiss. Helen stands looking at him. Helen holds out the glass. She turns and runs into the bathroom and picks up the gun. Don follows her. Helen holds it behind her. He half pushes, half leads her into the entrance hall. A wave of weakness overcomes him and he sags against the door. Don goes to the door and opens it.",
    "444": "Don freezes, his eyes turning towards the door, horrified. He rises slowly from the couch, takes a few steps towards the entrance door. At the door stands MRS. FOLEY, a middle-aged charwoman with a large utility bag over her arm. He stands galvanized. He goes to the kitchenette. On the counter under the cupboards stands the sugar bowl. Don lifts the lid. There's nothing but sugar in the bowl, but lining the lid is a folded five-dollar bill. Don takes it out, goes into the entrance hall and even though Mrs. Foley can't see him, instinctively holds the five dollars behind his back. She closes the door, takes the key and starts down the stairs. He looks at it, folds it neatly, pockets it, puts on his hat, then, with an afterthought, goes into the living room. THE CAMERA MOVES slowly toward them so that only about eight bottles fill the screen and we can see, between them, the shop, its window on Third Avenue, its entrance door. THE CAMERA IS BEHIND the rack of liquor in a store on Third Avenue. Through the glass door we see Don Birnam hurrying up. He peers into the shop to make sure there are no other customers, then quickly steps inside and stands breathing heavily. He gives a quick glance in each direction, to see that he's not observed. A salesman rises in the foreground, his back to the CAMERA. Don points to two bottles in the foreground. The salesman has taken two bottles from the rack in the foreground and put them on the counter. Don gives him the money and picks up the bottles like a miser grabbing gold. The salesman hands him a bag and steps out of the shot towards the cash register. Meanwhile, Don thrusts the bottles in the bag. The salesman hands him his change. It is a little short and the necks of the bottles protrude. Don pockets it. Don takes the package and walks past the newcomer towards the door, hiding it from him gracefully, like a football in a sneak play. Don comes out with the bottles in the paper bag. Don stops. In front of it is a fruit stand. Screening his gesture from the ladies with his back, he picks up three apples and puts them in the top of the bag, to camouflage the bottles. He puts down a coin, then walks down the street toward the ladies, flaunting a paper bag which is obviously full of apples. The lady with the dog sees him. He wants to start down the street but about twenty-five feet away stand two middle-aged Hokinson ladies, one of them kerbing her dog on a leash.",
    "446": "It is dusk. The electric lights are on. Suddenly Don pounds the bar and explodes. The bar is silent except for the sizzling noise of the eggs and ham. Nat brings over the plate of ham and eggs. Nat pours a jiggerful. Don downs it. Nat fills it. Then sits down to his ham and eggs. He drinks his jiggerful. He taps the glass on the bar. From the street enters Gloria, wearing a shirtwaist and skirt, another foolish little hat, and high-heeled shoes with bows. He pours another drink. A man has entered the bar, a round-faced, middle-aged man with pince-nez. With his thumb, Nat indicates Gloria. He takes a couple of steps towards the door, turns. There is a Guide of New York sticking from his pocket. He walks out, bewildered. He downs the jigger of rye. Nat does break down and pours a drink. He takes off his hat and shakes the rain from it, then peels off his raincoat. They are wearing raincoats, carrying umbrellas. He is alone and wears a bowler and a straight raincoat. A crowd of people is streaming into the building. It is doing a land-office business, checking dripping umbrellas and apparel. With a quick gesture he transfers the bottle to the pocket of the raincoat, rolls the raincoat up like swaddling clothes around a precious infant. In the side pocket of his suit is a pint of liquor. Among the crowd is Don Birnam. Don hands his coat to an attendant. His eyes linger on its pocket with a certain tenderness, then he turns and starts towards the door of the auditorium. Seeing an opening in the line at the cloak room counter, he steps into it. Don sits about five seats from the aisle. He sits between an elderly daughter and her age-old mother, and a middle-aged man and wife. He is glancing through the program as the curtain rises (changing the light on our group). Don looks up. Thirst in his eyes, he looks away from the stage, tries to concentrate on the ceiling of the Metropolitan. Powdered footmen are pouring wine into the glasses of the over-vivacious guests. Alfred and Violetta are batting the drinking song back and forth, as the chorus, glasses in hand, stands slowly swaying, echoing each couplet. As he looks at the stage, his imagination is working at top speed. The first drops of sweat are gathering on his forehead. He takes the handkerchief from his pocket and wipes his forehead. The swaying echelon of choristers SLOWLY DISSOLVES to a row of raincoats, exactly like the one Don wore. They hang from hangers and sway slowly to Verdi's rhythm. His eyes glued to what he sees on the stage.",
    "45": "REGGIE sits on the floor of the booth, dialing. An OPERATOR is speaking into a headset. There is a shot of the phone booth. REGGIE's head appears, peeking cautiously over the bottom of the window. The scene is viewed from inside the phone booth. Through the glass, ADAM can be seen leaving the Sortie area. Carefully, REGGIE opens the door and comes out. She goes to the corner and looks around it. ADAM walks away from the camera, down the platform. The camera pans to REGGIE, who is peeking around the corner. She looks back once more at ADAM, then makes up her mind and starts running towards the exit. As the bell rings announcing the next train, ADAM turns to look and sees REGGIE. This news hits REGGIE hard and she stops in alarm. REGGIE stands out in the open, the stamps in her hand, confused as to which man she should go to. She looks at one, then the other, not knowing what to do. REGGIE stops in alarm. During the following, ADAM looks around, looking for some way out. During this, ADAM has moved out from behind the columns, creeping cautiously across the open space between the two colonnades and finally, behind the second. As he aims carefully and fires, the bullet creases it. The deflected bullet rips the shoulder of his coat, leaving him unharmed. He wheels. With CARSON in the background, who fires at him. Quickly, ADAM peers back out and throws another shot. Seeing CARSON otherwise occupied, REGGIE turns and runs toward the open stage door of the Comédie Française behind her. Including CARSON who, seeing REGGIE running to the door, turns and fires at her. But he is too late -- she is safely inside. CARSON looks quickly back toward ADAM, then takes off after REGGIE. He runs to it, tries the door and enters. As CARSON enters the auditorium and looks around, the camera sweeps the magnificent old theatre -- boxes, seats, stage, but there is no sign of REGGIE. As CARSON walks up the aisle checking between the rows of seats, a large room, lit by a single bare bulb, under the stage is shown. ADAM appears, moving cautiously, gun ready. He creeps along next to the wall, looking around at all the various scenic pieces which fill the room. As CARSON moves carefully across the darkened stage near the footlights, looking for REGGIE, at mid-stage, the camera pans down to his feet, only a few inches from the prompter's box. Inside, huddling down, is a terrified REGGIE, holding her breath as she watches him. As CARSON moves into the opposite wings, sees the light board and throws on all the switches, the stage is bathed in light. He returns to the stage.",
    "450": "Behind the glass lies the folder of matches. However, it attracts Don's attention enough to make him push the glass to one side. The waiter takes the check which is thrust between his vest and his stiff shirt and puts it face down in front of Don, then hurries on with the tray of drinks. Don turns the check over. He puts his hand in his pocket and pulls out what cash he has. He hasn't enough -- only two one-dollar bills and some small change. At that moment the waiter returns, expecting to be paid. Taking the check, the waiter leaves. Next him the couple is cooing away like Spring, -- but on the bench between him and the girl lies her bag. There must be some money in that bag. The man is whispering something into the girl's ear. She is shaking her head. Don looks around the room, his plan forming. As though inadvertently, he drops his hand on the bench beside the bag. It's a handsome leather bag with gold initials, M. M. The bag moves very close to his coat. Don pulls the purse imperceptibly closer to himself. Now, switching his cigarette, Don crosses his other arm so he can pull the bag up under his coat. He pulls it to his armpit and holds it there, tucked close to his ribs. Very calmly Don smokes his cigarette, a great gentleman. The waiter comes back with the drink. Guests and waiters are passing by. He points to a door at the other end of the room. There is a tiny puzzled look from the waiter as Don walks slowly towards the wash room. The waiter pulls the table away for him. Don starts to rise. It's a two-wash-basin affair, with a colored attendant who, as Don enters, is brushing a customer. Don carries the bag under his open coat by the pressure of his upper arm. Between his fingers is a cigarette, so that the whole thing looks fairly natural. As Don picks up the cake of soap, he watches the attendant get a polishing rag and bend down to dust off his shoes. He puts down the cake of soap, pulls out the bag, opens it. There, between a compact, lipstick and keyes, are some bills. He fishes out a ten-dollar bill, thrusts it in his pocket and is about to close the purse when he sees the carnations. He can't help smiling at the idea which flashes into his mind. He takes one of the carnations, puts it into the purse, closes the purse and thrusts it back under his coat. Just as the attendant straightens up, Don puts both hands into the water.",
    "451": "THE KID'S GRANDFATHER bursts into the room. Kind of rumpled. But the eyes are bright. He has a wrapped package tucked under one arm as he immediately goes to The Kid, pinches his cheek. The Mother ignores it, beats a retreat. And she is gone. There's an uncomfortable silence, then. The Kid does. He does his best to smile. Suddenly passionate. THE TWO OF THEM as the Grandfather sits in a chair by the bed. The story he's reading about, as the monochromatic look of the bedroom is replaced by the dazzling color of the English countryside. BUTTERCUP is standing, holding the reins of her horse, while in the background, WESTLEY, in the stable doorway, looks at her. Buttercup is in her late teens; doesn't care much about clothes and she hates brushing her long hair, so she isn't as attractive as she might be, but she's still probably the most beautiful woman in the world. Westley is perhaps half a dozen years older than Buttercup. And maybe as handsome as she is beautiful. He gazes at her as she walks away. WESTLEY, outside, chopping wood. Buttercup drops two large buckets near him. She leaves; his eyes stay on her. She stops, turns--he manages to look away as now her eyes stay on him. Westley enters with an armload of firewood. He gets it, hands it to her; they are standing very close to each other gazing into each other's eyes. WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, outside his tiny hovel in the red glow of sunset. They are locked in a passionate kiss. They stand near the gate to the farm, locked in an embrace. He smiles at her, she smiles too, throws her arms so tightly around him. They kiss. Then as Westley walks away, Buttercup watches him go. Buttercup, staring out the window of her room. HOLD ON HER FACE, perfect and perfectly sad. The main courtyard of Florin replete with townspeople, livestock, and a bustling marketplace. PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, a man of incredible power and bearing, standing in his royal robes on a castle balcony. Three others standing behind him: an OLD COUPLE with crowns, the aging KING AND QUEEN, and a dark bearded man who seems the Prince's match in strength: this is COUNT RUGEN. A giant staircase leading to the CROWD and as a FIGURE just begins to become visible. THE CROWD, as they see the figure. (We haven't yet.) And if there is such a thing as collective action, then this crowd, collectively, holds its breath. THE STAIRCASE, as the figure appears in the archway. And she resplendent. She descends the stairs and starts to move amongst the people. THE CROWD, and they do a very strange thing: with no instruction at all, they suddenly go to their knees.",
    "454": "The scene freezes, Humperdinck caught in mid-sentence. The Kid is half sitting now, not strong yet, but clearly stronger than when we first saw him. And on these words. And on his words. We saw before, as Buttercup emerges. The crowd, suddenly going to its knees, wave after wave of silent kneeling people. All of them down. Buttercup, touched as before, but then she seems stunned as we. She advances on Buttercup now, who is more and more panicked. Buttercup, coming out of her nightmare, alone in her castle bedroom. As she frantically grabs a robe and starts to run. Buttercup, bursting into the Prince's chambers. Count Rugen stands nearby. Just stunned. Finally, softly, he begins to talk. And she nods. The trees are unusual in one respect: all of them are extraordinarily heavily knotted. Humperdinck and Rugen, walking into the grove of trees. They are deeper into the grove now. Rugen is searching around. Rugen smiles and hurries down the stairs as the tree slides back perfectly into place. Count Rugen, dragging Westley up alongside the thing--Levers and wheels and wires, you name it, it's there. He has suction cups on his head now, on his temple, on his heart, his hands and feet. He says nothing, keeps control of himself. And then he opens the flood gate, water pours down the chute, turning the wheel, which in turn really gets The Machine going. Westley, and he's lying on the table, and he's only flesh and the chains are metal and thick, but such is his desperation it almost seems he might break them. It keeps on coming as we finally. He switches off The Machine, picks up a large notebook and pen, sits in a chair. Westley, in anguish so deep it is dizzying. Helpless, he cries. Count Rugen watches the tears. Then starts to write in his quarters, swamped. Piles of papers are strewn all over. Now Yellin, a pale, shifty, quick-eyed man appears in the doorway. Entering. The Prince and Yellin, turning to her in the doorway. As she glides out. A lot of hollering is going on. The thieves are being rounded up by the Brute Squad, a large group of large men. Yellin stands on a wagon in the midst of all the scuffling. And his wagon starts, and as it does. Inigo, drunk as a skunk, sprawled in front of a hovel, a bottle of brandy in one hand, the six-fingered sword in the other. He looks dreadful. Unshaven, puffy-eyed, gaunt. Inigo feels a hand on his back. He compares it to his own smaller hand. And as the Assistant Brute is just about to club Inigo's brains out, Fezzik lets fly with a stupendous punch.",
    "46": "He stoops to read it. Satisfied, he recovers the foot, then moves to the other end to uncover the head. As the sheet starts to lift, she closes her eyes for a moment, then looks again. She nods. She nods again. GRANDPIERRE moves into the SHOT. GRANDPIERRE nods as he turns to the unseen ATTENDANT. CAMERA suddenly moves as the 'drawer' is slid back into the wall. BLACKNESS comes with a loud clang and continues while the echo dies. CLOSE SHOT -- DESK DRAWER (FROM ABOVE) as it is pulled open. A photograph of Charles Lampert lies face up in the drawer. Including GRANDPIERRE sitting behind his desk, and REGGIE, sitting across from him. The office is as bare as most policemen's offices. She starts to rummage through her bag. But she pulls a package of nuts out of her bag. She begins separating the shells with her thumb nail and eating the nuts, depositing the shells in the ashtray. GRANDPIERRE watches this for an instant. GRANDPIERRE sighs, puts down his pencil and pushes a button on the desk. He removes a cigar from his desk and inserts it into his mouth. He rips the cigar out of his mouth and slams it back into the drawer, closing it fiercely. The door opens and the POLICEMAN enters again, this time carrying a wicker basket which he deposits on GRANDPIERRE's desk, and leaves. GRANDPIERRE peers into the basket. He begins to take them out, placing them on the desk, identifying each item as he does. GRANDPIERRE hands her the letter and watches her closely as she reads it. He slides a sheet of paper and pen across to her, then starts to put the things back into the basket while he speaks. He reaches into the desk drawer and pulls out a passport which he hands to her. The cover indicates that it is Swiss. REGGIE's hand opens it to a picture of a man -- the man we saw in GRANDPIERRE's photo. He hands her another passport. The cover is American. He hands her, one at a time, two more passports. His eyes still lowered. CAMERA PANS DOWN to feature his hands -- he is methodically trimming his nails with a small clipper. The front DOOR of the Chapel is heard opening and a shaft of daylight streams in. The short, heavy-set figure of a MAN is outlined against the bright outdoor light. He stands for a moment, then closes the door after him. LEOPOLD GIDEON, short-sighted, bald, in his middle forties, glances around nervously, like a barnyard bird. Then he walks down one of the side aisles of the Chapel. As he watches GIDEON. As she watches him. GIDEON arrives at the coffin.",
    "465": "Then suddenly, FEZZIK jumps forward with stunning speed for anyone his size and reaches for the Man In Black who drops to his knees, spins loose, and slips between the Giant's legs. FEZZIK considers this a moment, then attacks, and if he moved quickly last time, this time he is blinding and as the Man In Black slips down to avoid the charge, FEZZIK moves right with him, only instead of twisting free and jumping to his feet, this time the Man In Black jumps for FEZZIK's back and in a moment he is riding him, and his arms have FEZZIK's throat, locked across FEZZIK's windpipe, one in front, one behind. The Man In Black begins to squeeze. Tighter. FEZZIK charges toward a huge rock that lines the path, and just as he reaches it he spins his giant body so that the entire weight of the charge is taken by the Man In Black. And the power of the charge is terrible, the pain enormous, but he clings to his grip at FEZZIK's windpipe. Again FEZZIK charges, slower this time, but still a charge, and again he spins and creams the Man In Black against the rough boulder. And the punishment is terrible, and for a moment it seems as if he is going to let go of FEZZIK's windpipe and crumble, but he doesn't, he holds on. Again FEZZIK slams the Man In Black against a boulder, only this time his power has diminished and FEZZIK starts to slowly collapse. And there isn't much breath coming. THE MAN IN BLACK holds his grip as FEZZIK tries to stand, halfway makes it, but there is no air. Back to his knees he falls, holds there for a moment, and pitches down to all fours. The Man In Black increases the pressure. FEZZIK tries to crawl. But there is just no air. FEZZIK goes to earth and lies still. FEZZIK, as the Man In Black turns him over, puts his ear to FEZZIK's heart. The Man In Black stands. And he nimbly scoops up his sword with his foot, catches it and as he dashes off up along the mountain path. PRINCE HUMPERDINCK slips his boot into a foot print in the sand. Count Rugen mounted, watches. Behind him, half a dozen armed WARRIORS, also mounted. A GREAT WHITE HORSE waits riderless in front. Humperdinck is all over the rocky ground, and maybe he isn't the best hunter in the world. Then again, maybe he is. Because, as he begins to put his feet into strange positions, we realize that what he is doing is miming the fencers. And he gallops off. THE MAN IN BLACK crests the peak of the mountain.",
    "47": "He stops, looks down at LAMPERT's body for a moment. Then, suddenly, in rapid succession, he sneezes six times. He takes a small bottle from his pocket, shakes a pill from it and swallows it dry. He turns and walks back up the aisle, looking for a place to sit. He comes face to face with GRANDPIERRE, stops, turns to sit somewhere else. Again, the sound of the DOOR opening interrupts them. They turn to look. Again the figure of a MAN is outlined in silhouette against the outside brightness. He wears a velvet-corduroy suit, string tie and a bright yellow flower in his lapel. A bulldurham tag hangs from his outside breast pocket, dangling from its string. He starts down the aisle toward the bier, CAMERA LEADING him, and we notice his unsteady gait. He turns to look at the others present. MOVING down the aisle. GRANDPIERRE's face, then GIDEON's, then REGGIE's and SYLVIE's -- all staring at CAMERA. As TEX arrives. He stands staring at LAMPERT's body, swaying on his feet until he reaches out and grabs the side of the coffin to steady himself. Then he takes the flower from his lapel and throws it into the open box. SYLVIE points to REGGIE. Unruffled, TEX starts over. addressing REGGIE this time. She pulls out the letter and starts to read it. It bears the Great Seal as a letterhead and the typed message reads: SYLVIE has been reading over REGGIE's shoulder. The elevator door closes on them. REGGIE reacts to this and starts down the hall, finally stopping at the door. The office is empty, the typewriter on the secretary's desk is covered with its plastic shroud. REGGIE enters, looks for somebody, notices that the door to the private office is slightly ajar. BARTHOLOMEW comes to the door and looks in. He is a pale grey-haired man who looks, on first examination, older than his forty-odd years. Sickly would be the word that describes him best -- pallid, consumptive-looking. He wears heavy tortoise-framed glasses which fall down his nose and cause him to push them back in place every so often with a quick automatic motion. He motions for her to enter, standing aside to let her do so. A small cubicle -- there is a silver-framed photo of three kids on the desk. A can of lighter fluid stands open on the desk and a crumpled hankie beside it. He works at a stain on his necktie with lighter fluid and hankie. He looks up at her, laughs silently, then goes back to his tie. He puts away the lighter fluid in a desk drawer, smells the hankie, passes on it, then sticks it in his pocket.",
    "473": "Mozart is suddenly delighted. He throws the door wide open so that the guests can see into the private apartment where the Archbishop sits - and he can see them. Colloredo is clearly discomfited by this reception of his employee. He smiles and bows uneasily, as they include him in the small ovation. Mozart stands in the corridor, out of the Archbishop's line of sight, bowing and giggling, and encouraging the applause for the Archbishop with conducting gestures. Suddenly irritated, Colloredo signs to Arco, who steps forward and shuts the door, ending the applause. Salieri, in this vast room, is standing and looking at the full score of the Serenade. Instantly, we again hear its lyrical strains. CU, Salieri, reading the score of the Adagio in helpless fascination. Suddenly the music snaps off. Mozart stands before him as he lays down the score. He takes the score, bows, and struts briskly out of the room. Salieri stares uncomprehendingly after the jaunty little figure. At the table sits the EMPEROR JOSEPH II, eating his frugal dinner and sipping goat's milk. He is an intelligent, dapper man of forty, wearing a military uniform. Around him but standing, are his Chamberlain, JOHANN VON STRACK: stiff and highly correct. COUNT ORSINI-ROSENBERG: a corpulent man of sixty, highly conscious of his position as Director of the Opera. BARON VON SWIETEN, the Imperial Librarian: a grave but kindly and educated man in his mid-fifties. FIRST KAPELLMEISTER GIUSEPPE BONNO: very Italian, cringing and time-serving, aged about seventy. And Salieri, wearing decorous black, as usual. At a side-table, two Imperial secretaries, using quill pens and inkstands, write down everything of importance that is said. He looks defiantly at Orsini-Rosenberg. A somber room which serves both as a bedroom and a study. Opposite this image sits Salieri at his desk, on which stands a pile of music paper, quill pens and ink. On one side of him is an open forte-piano on which he occasionally tries notes from the march he is composing, with some difficulty. He scratches notes out with his quill, and ruffles his hair - which we see without a powdered wig. The Salesman puts the second wig on his head. Mozart pulls a face of doubt in the mirror. He giggles. He turns and comes into the salon, where another group awaits him. It consists of Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno, Von Swieten and Salieri. The room contains several gilded chairs dotted about, and a forte-piano. All bow and say, Good morning, Your Majesty. He produces a paper. The Emperor goes to the instrument, sits and plays the first bars of it. He plays a wrong note. Mozart throws himself to his knees, and to Joseph's discomfort kisses the royal hand with fervour.",
    "474": "Embarrassed, Mozart bursts into a wild giggle. Joseph helps him out. Von Strack and Bonno nod. Orsini-Rosenberg nods without enthusiasm. He stops short with a little giggle. He giggles again. Orsini-Rosenberg looks at him sourly. The Italian faction - Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno - laugh discreetly. An embarrassed pause. Bonno giggles in nervous amusement. Joseph is clearly pleased. He nods - he has wanted this result all the time. Then he becomes aware of the manuscript in his hand. Then he goes to the forte-piano and seats himself. The others, except for Salieri, gather around the manuscript held by the King. Mozart plays the first half of the march with deadly accuracy. He plays the first half again but stops in the middle of a phrase, which he repeats dubiously. All the courtiers look at Salieri. He plays another phrase. He plays another phrase. Gradually, he alters the music so that it turns into the celebrated march to be used later in The Marriage of Figaro, Non Piu Andrai. He plays it with increasing abandon and virtuosity. Salieri watches with a fixed smile on his face. The court watches, astonished. He finishes in great glory, takes his hands off the keys with a gesture of triumph - and grins. We see the olivewood cross. Salieri is sitting at his desk, staring at it. Cavalieri sings her next scale, then another one, and another one, doing her exercises in earnest. As she hits a sustained high note the orchestral accompaniment in the middle of Martern Aller Arten from Il Seraglio comes in underneath and the music changes from exercises to the exceedingly florid aria. We DISSOLVE on the singer's face, and she is suddenly not merely turbaned, but painted and dressed totally in a Turkish manner, and we are on. The house is full. Watching the performance - which is conducted by Mozart from the clavier in the midst of the orchestra - we note Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all grouped around the Emperor, in a box. In another box we see an overdressed, middle-aged woman and three girls, one of whom is Constanze. This is the formidable MADAME WEBER and her three daughters, Constanze, JOSEFA and SOPHIE. All are enraptured by the spectacle and Madame Weber is especially enraptured by being there at all. Cavalieri is singing Martern aller Arten from the line Doch du bist entschlossen. Music up again for the last 30 bars of the aria. All the cast is lined up on stage. Mozart is conducting with happy excitement. Mozart bows frantically: he is over-excited. She moves toward Mozart with arms outstretched in an absurd theatrical gesture, then sees the Emperor. She stares at him, mesmerized, her mouth open, unable even to curtsey.",
    "476": "He stands shaking, staring wildly. Constanze gets up, perplexed. Overjoyed, she stops and kisses his hand. He raises her - and then clasps her to him clumsily. They stare at one another: Constanze in total disbelief. He glares at her. Salieri sits at his desk, staring up at the cross. Salieri stares at the cross. Salieri stirs himself. A servant appears. She looks at him inquiringly, and drops the portfolio on the floor; pages of music pour out of it. To its grand and weighty sound, Constanze starts to undress, watched by the horrified Salieri. He opens his mouth in distress. The candle flickers over her as she removes her clothes and prepares for his embrace. CU, the fireplace. In it lies the olivewood Christ on the cross, burning. Mozart chuckles delightedly. Salieri offers him a glass of white dessert and a spoon. Mozart takes it absently and goes on talking. Hysterical barking and howling. The hall is full of dogs, at least five, all jumping up and dashing about and making a terrific racket. Mozart, dandified in a new coat and a plumed hat for the occasion, has arrived to teach at the house of a prosperous merchant, MICHAEL SCHLUMBERG. Bluff, friendly and coarse-looking, he stands in his hall amidst the leaping and barking animals, greeting Mozart. Suddenly the girl rises. Mozart smiles at the parents. They smile nervously back. Mozart slides along the bench, raises his hands and preludes over the keys. Instantly a dog howls loudly. Startled, Mozart stops. Mozart stops. Amazed, Mozart starts to play the Rondo again. The dog howls louder. He bows to them and leaves the room. Both men embrace. A cramped, low-ceilinged little room which nobody has tidied for ages. Also there are many empty wine bottles; musical instruments - among them a mandolin, a viola, a forte-piano with the black and white keys reversed - books and abandoned plates of food. Mozart clasps his father's arms. Leopold is now seen as an aging, travel-stained man in clothes that need repair. His face is lined, and he is obviously not in perfect health. He carries the bag across the room. Constanze lies in bed. She sits up, startled. He opens the door of the bedroom. Constanze, who looks ill and tired, stares at Leopold. Leopold stares back from the doorway. He closes the door again. He picks up some pages of manuscript. Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children. As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. Applause. All the bystanders are watching. SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her. A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle.",
    "479": "Mary looks at his smile, has to respond, pulls him to her, kisses him. Then, and without breaking the kiss, she swings her legs over the side of the bed, toe-searches around, finds her shoes, slips her feet into them. And finally pulls away and sits up. She rises, goes to the bureau, takes a pair of small earrings out of her bag, begins putting them on, not bothering or perhaps not wanting to look at herself in the mirror. Sam watches her, concerned but unable to inhibit his cheery, humorous good mood. Throughout remainder of this scene, they occupy themselves with dressing, hair-combing, etc. She stares at him, surprised at his willingness to continue the affair on her terms, as girls are so often surprised when they discover men will continue to want them even after the sexual bait has been pulled in. Sam smiles reassuringly, places his hands gently on her arms, speaks with gentle and simple sincerity. He moves away and again the weight of his pain and problems crushes away his good humor. He looks at her, long, pulls her close, kisses her lightly, looks out the window and stares at the wide sky. Mary goes out quickly, closing door behind her. As Sam stares down at his shoeless feet. A small, moderately successful office off the main street. We see Mary get out of cab, pay driver, cross pavement to the office door. Mary enters office, crosses to her desk, sits down, rubs her temples, finally looks over at Caroline, a girl in the last of her teens. She rises, starts for Mary's desk, pills in hand. She breaks off, distracted by the SOUND of the door opening. MR. LOWERY and his oil-lease client, TOM CASSIDY enter the office. Lowery flashes an embarrassed smile at Mary, tries to lead Cassidy toward the private office. Cassidy pauses beside Mary's desk, hooks a haunch onto the desktop, smiles a wet smile at Mary. Mary glances, cannot bring herself to smile or make some remark, continues sorting out the deed copies, tries to ignore the man's hot-breath closeness. He rises, reels toward Lowery's office, pauses, turns, speaks to Mary, meaningfully. Lowery starts after him, pauses, turns to Mary. Cassidy has gone into Lower's office. He starts quickly away when it looks like Cassidy is going to come and pull him bodily into the office. When the men are gone and the door is closed, Caroline picks up a bundle, smiles at it. Mary has put one bundle into a large envelope and takes the other from Caroline. When the bills are away, she puts the filled envelope in her handbag, notices the remaining deed copies on her desk, picks them up, goes to the private office door, knocks, starts to open door.",
    "480": "They pause and Norman pauses. Norman walks past Sam, giving him the sort of quick, disapproving glance one gives a man who is obviously lying, goes onto the porch and into the office. Sam and Lila follow Norman. Norman crosses to the desk, goes behind it, takes the key to cabin number twelve off the keyboard. Sam and Lila have entered and are almost to the desk-counter by this time. Sam eyes scan the counter, looking for a registration book. Lila moves closer, studies the book as Sam signs in. When Sam has finished he closes book, hands it back to Norman. As he starts for the door, Sam laughs. Norman stops, turns, looks at him. Sam smiles as if at a funny remark, takes a bill out of his pocket. Norman goes reluctantly behind counter, lays down the key to cabin twelve, takes a receipt book out of the drawer under counter, starts to write. Lila steps up to the desk, picks up the key, quickly, starts out. Norman looks up, gazes her as she goes out door. Lila comes along the porch, pauses before cabin one, tries the door. It opens. She closes it quickly as she hears Sam and Norman coming out of the motel office, continues on down the porch. Sam considers a moment, nods agreement, rises. He goes to the door, opens it slightly, looks out, then, back to Lila. Lila goes to the door. He holds it open and she goes out. Sam closes the door, joins Lila, takes her hand. Together they walk along the porch in the direction of Cabin One. They pause before the door of Cabin One. Sam motions Lila to wait, to hold still, then goes on to the office, opens the door, calls in. Sam lifts the piece of paper off her finger, studies it, takes out his wallet, presses the wet scrap to his driver's license shield, puts it back in the wallet and puts the wallet away. She starts out of the bathroom. Sam takes hold of her arm, stops her. Lila nods quickly, hurries to the door. Sam gets to it first, opens it a slight crack, looks out, then opens it wide enough for Lila and Himself to pass through. ANGLE CLOSE on cabin one as Lila comes out, turns to her left, goes along porch toward cabin twelve. Sam remains at the door, then turns right, heading for the path. As he passes the office, he is shocked to see Norman standing just inside the open door. Sam starts into the office. She watches Sam disappear into the office, waits until she hears the door close, then looks about for another way to reach the house.",
    "484": "A WOMAN passes the window, pauses, peers out. We see her in clear silhouette. She quickly goes away from the window. Mary, having seen the woman, expects now that she will get some attention. She dashes out into the rain, to her car, gets in, opens the side window, begins to honk the horn. After a moment, a YOUNG MAN opens the front door of the house, pauses, starts down the path. Mary leaves her car, starts a dash for the shelter of the porch. Seeing that Mary is on her way to the porch, he runs quickly, the umbrella unopened in his hand. He gets to the porch a moment after Mary has reached it. He stops short, looks at her, then at the umbrella hanging useless in his hand, then back to her. He gestures her into the office, standing back to indicate that he will go after her. She goes into the office. The Young Man follows Mary in, closes the door. He is NORMAN BATES, somewhere in his late twenties, thin and tall, soft-spoken and hesitant. He is behind the counter now, pushing forward the registration book. Mary has placed her handbag on the counter. She takes the registration book, picks up the pen, is suddenly struck with the realization that she'd better use an alias. She writes the name Marie Samuels. He removes a key for Cabin One. We see that there is a remaining key on the board. He goes to door, opens it. The rain has slowed down considerably. Mary follows him to the door, goes out on the porch, waits and watches as Norman runs to her car, gets in, drives it to the parking space in front of Cabin One. Mary walks along the porch, waits before the door of Cabin One. Norman gets out of car, with suitcase, runs to the door, opens it, pushes the door open, puts his hand in and switches on a light. Mary goes into the cabin. Norman follows her. Norman places suitcase on bed, goes to the window, opens it. Mary closes the door, goes to suitcase, opens it, starts to take out a dress. Her handbag is next to the suitcase. She glances down into it, pauses, drops the dress, reaches into the handbag, takes out the money-filled envelope, stares at it, almost with regret, filled contemplates hiding it, decides to, starts looking for a reasonable hiding place. She looks about, at the closet, the drawers etc., realizes all such places are obvious. Catching sight of the newspaper in her bag, she hits on a solution. She opens the newspaper, places the envelope within it, lock-folds the paper again and then places it on the bedside table as if it were there for later reading.",
    "485": "Mary walks slowly to the window, realizing that the terrible voice is coming from the house behind the cabins. CAMERA FOLLOWS her to window and once there we see the light is still on in the upstairs bedroom and the voice is coming from that room. Mary has stood by the window, listening with mounting distress and concern and sympathy. She turns her face away now, gazes sadly at the little empty room. Mary turns, looks out the window. We see Norman coming down the path, carrying a napkin-covered tray. Mary looks at him for a moment, then turns quickly, goes to the door, opens it and goes out onto the porch. Mary pauses outside the door, is about to start forward when Norman comes round the building and walks along the porch, past the office, stopping only when he is close to her. He stares with painful embarrassment at the knowing look in her eye. She begins to back into her room. Norman starts to follow, hesitates as he sees the total picture of an attractive young woman and a motel room. Bringing down the tray of food, in defiance of his mother's orders, is about the limit of his defiance for one day. Without waiting for approval or disapproval, he turns, hurries to the office. Mary looks after him, her face showing amused sympathy, then follows. Norman looks about, tray in hand, sees there is no reasonable place to spread out a supper. He turns, sees Mary standing in the doorway. As Norman goes about spreading out the bread and ham and pouring the milk, we follow Mary across the room. She notices, too, the paintings on the wall; nudes, primarily, and many with a vaguely religious overtone. Finally Mary reaches the sofa, sits down, looks at the spread. Mary begins to eat, her attitude a bit tense. She takes up a small slice of ham, bites off a tiny bite, nibbles at it in the manner of one disturbed and preoccupied. Norman gazes at her, at the tiny bite she has taken, smiles and then laughs. Mary looks at him, with some compression, smiles. Norman turns, slowly, looking at her with a striking coldness. The fury suddenly dies, abruptly and completely, and he sinks back into his chair. Mary watches the troubled man, is almost physically pained by his anguish. She goes out of the parlor. We see her, from Norman's viewpoint, as she crosses the small office, goes out into the night. He goes into the office and looks at the book. He goes back into the parlor with a mystified expression. Norman turns his ear from the direction of the SOUNDS, seems to be fighting an impulse to listen, or more than listen.",
    "487": "A low terrible groan begins to rise up out of her throat. A hand comes into the shot. The hand holds an enormous bread knife. Over it the brief gulps of screaming. And then the dreadful thump as Mary's body falls in the tub. Above the shower-bar we see the bathroom door open again and after a moment we HEAR the SOUND of the front door slamming. Lying half in, half out of the tub, the head tumbled over, touching the floor, the hair wet, one eye wide open as if popped, one arm lying limp and wet along the tile floor. Coming down the side of the tub, running thick and dark along the porcelain, we see many small threads of blood. CAMERA FOLLOWS away from the body, travels slowly across the bathroom, past the toilet, out into the bedroom. As CAMERA approaches the bed, we see the folded newspaper as Mary placed it on the bedside table. beside the bed. The CAMERA now moves away over to the window and looks up to the house, and as it gets there we HEAR, coming from within the house, the SOUND of Norman's fearful, shocked voice. She stops, the anxiety and fear building up in her, her eyes beginning to fill with worried tears. Sam studies her for a moment, then turns and calls. Bob gets the message, goes out through the back way. Sam goes closer to Lila, speaks with soft seriousness. And Arbogast studies it, then speaks. He nods, takes down the closed-for-lunch sign, sails it to the counter, opens door, goes out into the street. Norman is holding the door open, so Arbogast walks in. Norman switches on the overhead light, starts for the linen closet, suddenly pauses, turns, studies Arbogast, who has remained standing by the door. He waits a moment, then opens closet, starts counting out sheets and pillow cases, keeps his back to Arbogast. Arbogast takes a photograph out of his pocket, talks as he crosses to Norman. Norman glances, briefly, turns away, lifts sheets and pillow cases off the shelf holds them close, almost protectively. He goes to the wall, flips a light switch. He takes a slip of paper out of his pocket, lays it beside the signature in the registry book, all the while nodding and smiling nicely, as if this discovery will make Norman as happy as it is making him. Arbogast has reached him, the picture extended. Norman looks dutifully at it. Norman becomes apprehensive, starts to Arbogast, forcing himself to remain calm and cheerful. Arbogast turns, gazes seriously at him. Norman looks up, studies the man's face, his own face showing apprehension. As he turns the car out, his headlights light up the porch.",
    "490": "Malcolm points to the HUGE FRAMED CERTIFICATE propped up on a dining room chair. It's printed on aged parchment-type paper. The frame is a polished mahogany. He slips on the sweatshirt. Her attention slowly moves to the framed certificate. She leans forward her seat and reads the certificate out loud as Malcolm tries to tickle her. Anna turns to Malcolm. He smiles. Anna takes his hands and holds them steady. Anna lets go of his hands. Anna's eyes are emotional. Anna leans towards him. They hold each other tight. THEIR SWEET LAUGHTER FILLS THE HOUSE. TWO GIGGLING SHADOWS APPEAR IN THE BEDROOM DOORWAY. They try to turn on the light. The stranger slowly looks up for the first time. His eyes lock on Malcolm. The stranger suddenly comes forward into the doorway. Malcolm stumbles back onto the edge of the bed. Anna sees the stranger for the first time. Her face drains of color. The stranger looks at Malcolm. He half grins. Anna's expression instantly changes. The stranger turns and glares at Malcolm. Malcolm stops all movement. Malcolm stands. Tears fall down the stranger's face. Malcolm looks up at the sound of those words. VINCENT GRAY stares with surprise through his tears. Malcolm lets out a deep breath like he just emerged from deep waters. Vincent's eyes burn at Malcolm. VINCENT is fully crying now. Vincent turns to the sink. His hand goes in. He turns around and raises a gun at Malcolm. He FIRES. Malcolm clutches his stomach and folds like a rag doll onto the bed. Vincent instantly moves the gun to his own head. Handwritten notes fill every line. He glances through the page. Words and phrases are circled throughout the file. Malcolm sits on a sidewalk bench facing a row of brownstone homes across the street. He gazes blankly at the brownstones. A door opens. Malcolm is brought out of his trance. COLE SEAR steps out his front door. Cole is a munchkin of a boy with large, black eyes that seem to take in everything around him. His hair is dark, with a small patch of jet white on the side. Cole carefully locks the door behind him. The eight-year-old child reaches into his pocket and slips on a pair of VERY LARGE GLASSES. They look comical on him. Malcolm rises to his feet. When he looks up, Cole is gone. Malcolm barely catches a glimpse of the boy. Cole runs at full speed down the street and turns the corner. He stuffs the file in his bag and starts running too. Malcolm hauls down the sidewalk. He comes to a hard stop at a street intersection. COLE sprints across the empty lot and reaches the doors of a building.",
    "491": "After a second, he enters. Mr. Cunningham finds Cole sitting in a poor villager costume as a Female Teacher kneels next to him and makes final adjustments. Cole and the woman glance at Mr. Cunningham. Mr. Cunningham looks around the room and then directly at Cole. The Female Teacher looks to Cole and nods. The group of villagers on the stage laugh and mock. Tommy Tammisimo is dressed in a mismatched costume -- he hops around, clearly embarrassed. He smiles a true friend's smile. Cole hesitates. It takes him a moment before he steps forward. Cole steps up to the stone. He places his hand around the handle. Begins to pull. The sword starts to come out. Cole raises the shiny sword out of the stone and high above his head. Merlin and everyone on stage bows. Malcolm watches his client, standing unafraid in the spot light for the first time. The villagers rise and rush to Cole. They scoop him up and carry him around the stage in celebration. Cole chuckles and then starts laughing as the group of eight-year-olds try unsuccessfully to keep him up. They slowly sag and then collapse. All the students are laughing as they try to untangle themselves. Malcolm watches with utter joy as Cole becomes indistinguishable among of a group of twenty children giggling and enjoying themselves on stage. The rain comes down a little stronger now on the stained glass window. Malcolm sits on the stairs in the lobby. Cole walks back and forth in front of him. Cole still holds the sword from the play. Cole glances at Malcolm. Malcolm exhales very slowly as he gets up. Cole watches as Malcolm walks down the stairs to the entrance. Lynn glances over to Cole who sits in his seat silently. The way he says the words gives Lynn a chill. Cole takes a long time. Lynn gazes out the windshield at the line of red tail lights. Lynn looks over slowly. She eyes Cole. Lynn becomes upset. She nods with grave understanding. Cole watches her. Lynn's eyes moves to Cole. Cole gazes at her intense expression. Cole smiles a tiny smile. Lynn glances down. She drowns in her thoughts. Lynn looks up sharply. Lynn becomes still. Her face is unreadable. Lynn's eyes lock on Cole's. Lynn brings her hands to her mouth. Lynn begins to cry. Lynn covers her face with her hands. The tears roll out through her fingers. Lynn looks at her son. She barely gets the words out. Cole moves closer to Lynn. She cradles him in her arms. Mother and son hold each other tight. Malcolm walks quietly down the sidewalk towards his home. Malcolm enters the living room and smiles at what he sees.",
    "494": "Mr. Cunningham furrows his brow. Mr. Cunningham chuckles. Cole's face turns cement grey. Tommy Tammisimo leads the class in a wave of snickering. Cole glances up. Sees all the eyes on him. He glances at the teacher who is still staring. Mr. Cunningham sees the traumatized expression on Cole's face and instantly stops smiling. Mr. Cunningham's face becomes still. The class falls into stunned silence. Mr. Cunningham takes an involuntary step towards Cole's desk. Mr. Cunningham moves closer to Cole. Cole covers his eyes with his hands. We see Cole's mouth under his covered eyes. Cole stares for a second. Cole lowers his head. Malcolm just sits and thinks. Cole turns his head and stares at the windows. Malcolm takes in the sad vision of this boy. Cole's face softens a bit. He turns from the windows and looks to Malcolm. He places it in his right hand. Malcolm shakes his hand in circles. Cole watches his hand carefully. Malcolm taps the pocket but doesn't open it. Malcolm opens his right hand. The penny sits quietly in the center of his palm. Cole looks at the penny and then up to Malcolm's face. Cole cracks a smile. Cole smiles and holds out his hand. His fingers open to reveal the penny. Bobby stares. Cole loses his smile. Cole and the overweight boy stare at each other. Cole gives the boy his penny. Cole gazes at Bobby. Tommy glances down the hall and sees Cole standing frozen staring at the crawl space closet. Tommy grabs Darren. Tommy nudges Darren to move down the hall. Cole breaks from his trance as Tommy and Darren walk up. It happens too quick for Cole to react. Darren and Tommy shove Cole backwards. He stumbles into the darkness of the crawl space. Tommy slams the door closed. They crack smiles at each other as Cole bangs on the door. The BANGING GOES ON FOR A FEW SECONDS AND THEN IT JUST STOPS. Darren and Tommy look at each other and then back at the crawl space door. Darren and Tommy back away from the door as COLE SCREAMS IN TERROR at the top of his lungs. HIS BODY SLAMMING AGAINST THE WOOD. The two boys are statues as Cole's BLOOD-CHILLING YELLS FILL. FOOTSTEPS SPIKE THE AIR AS children and mothers come running down the hall. Lynn is one of them. Malcolm's affected by his client. Malcolm stares at the tired child sitting before him in the hospital bed. He slowly moves the rolling chair closer to Cole's bed. Malcolm breaks from his thoughts and looks at Cole who watches him with unwavering attention. Malcolm smiles. Cole takes an eternal pause. Malcolm just gazes quietly. Malcolm is very still and stares at Cole.",
    "497": "Cole just closes his eyes and holds his mom tight. We are in an antique store. Filled floor to ceiling with furniture and knickknacks. Anna stands with a YOUNG COUPLE. All three lean over and peer into a glass cabinet. An antique engagement ring sits on a velvet stand. The young woman looks at her beau. She places it in their hands. The young woman looks at Anna with great intrigue. The young man throws an odd glance at his fiance. The young man and the young woman gaze at Anna silently. They look down at the ring. Anna moves to the back desk where SEAN comes out. He's carrying an antique bench in his arms. He places it down and takes a much needed seat. Anna looks over to find Sean standing at his desk where a BIRTHDAY PRESENT sits on his tabletop. Sean looks at her. Malcolm looks up sharply. Cole is crying now. A long pause. They both just stare. Cole searches for the answer in Malcolm's eyes. Cole pushes it across the table. Malcolm gazes at it, then looks up at Cole's pained eyes. Malcolm sits stoically at his desk in his basement. Malcolm leans his head back against the chair. Stares into the shadows. Malcolm's eyes scan the room and come to a stop on a box marked with the label. A tape slides into the tape player seated on Malcolm's desk. Malcolm's eyes are locked on the spool of audio tape as it spins in the player. Malcolm's fingers move to the volume dial. He turns it way up. THE STATIC NOISE FROM THE TAPE FILLS THE BASEMENT. Cole holds up his plastic rifleman. Malcolm's eyes show he understands now. Malcolm glances around the empty church before looking back up to Cole. Cole looks nervous. Cole and Malcolm stand silently in the center aisle of the back of the church. Malcolm moves around the corner on his street. His mind surges with thoughts. And then he glances up. His steps slow to a complete stop. Further down the sidewalk, coming out of the front door of his house is SEAN. Malcolm's face turns to stone. He watches as Sean comes down the front stairs and starts across the street. Malcolm moves towards Sean fast. Sean reaches his car and enters it. Sean pulls away into traffic almost hitting another car as he does. Malcolm watches the car disappear down the next street. Malcolm turns and looks up at his home with unchecked anger and overwhelming pain erupting his eyes. Cole quickly gets up and rushes out of the tent. He stumbles out. A table with a sewing machine fills the other side of the room.",
    "500": "Thelma has the phone tucked under her chin, as she cuts out coupons from the newspaper and pins them on a bulletin board already covered with them. Thelma goes through the living room to the bottom of the stairs and leans on the banister. Darryl comes trotting down the stairs. Darryl is checking himself out in the hall mirror, and it's obvious he likes what he sees. He exudes over-confidence for reasons that never become apparent. He likes to think of himself as a real lady killer. He is making imperceptible adjustments to his over-moussed hair. Thelma watches approvingly. He's finally ready. He walks to the door and gives Thelma the most perfunctory kiss on the cheek. Louise comes over and takes the phone out of his hand. They both hang up. Louise pulls out in a green '66 T-Bird in mint condition. Going into the suitcase is bathing suits, wool socks, flannel pajamas, jeans, sweaters, T-shirts, a couple of dresses, way too much stuff for a two-day trip. Thelma, standing in front of a closet, tries to decide what else to bring, as if she's forgotten something. The room looks like it was decorated entirely from a Sears catalog. It's really frilly. A perfectly ordered suitcase, everything neatly folded and orderly. Three pairs of underwear, one pair of long underwear, two pairs of pants, two sweaters, one furry robe, one nightgown. She could be packing for camp. Louise is revealed. Her room is as orderly as the suitcase. Everything matches. She is debating whether to take an extra pair of socks. She decides not to and closes the suitcase. She goes to the phone, picks it up and dials. They load everything into the car. The trunk barely closes. They get into the car and pull out of the driveway. As they drive down the street, we hear Thelma let out a long howl. She is laughing and she sticks her arms straight up in the air. They are driving down the interstate. Thelma reaches for her purse and finds the gun. Louise shrieks at the sight of it. Thelma wonders if Louise is really that naive. Louise reaches over and takes the gun out of Thelma's purse and holds it in her hand. She tests the weight of it, and then puts it under the seat. Thelma puts the bullets under the seat. They are speeding off down the highway with the RADIO blaring. Louise puts in a TAPE of wild R&B MUSIC. They are both silent for a minute. After a pause. Louise realizes that Thelma is going to revert to a teenager and continue whining unless she gives in. They pull off at a place down on the right all lit up with neon.",
    "502": "She picks up the check and looks at it. Harlan has led Thelma off to the far end of the parking lot. He is trying to kiss her now. He is pushing her arms down and turning her head away. Harlan is pushing himself on her now, and she is beginning to push him away harder. Harlan has now pinned Thelma against the back of a car and is kissing her neck. He has her ass in his hands. He is beginning to hump her. She is pushing him away as hard as she can, but he is relentless. He looks mean and dangerous. He lets go of her face and pins her arms behind her. He holds both of her arms with one hand. With his free hand, he reaches down and starts to pull her dress up. Thelma is still struggling and there are tears running down her face. TIGHT SHOT of the barrel of Thelma's gun being pressed into the nape of Harlan's neck. Louise's thumb pulls back the hammer. Harlan slowly raises his hands in the air, and Thelma darts out, pulling her dress down. Louise starts to back away, but the gun is still close to his face. His pants are undone in the front. She is still backing away with the gun raised. Thelma is inching away as well. Louise lowers the gun and stares at him for a second. Then she turns and walks away. Thelma does, too. Louise stops in her tracks. Louise takes two long strides back towards him, raises the gun and FIRES a bullet into his face. The car behind him is splattered with blood. Thelma and Louise are both silent. Louise lowers the gun. Thelma runs to get the car. Thelma comes careening up in reverse. Louise hops in and Thelma PEELS OUT, spraying gravel. As they speed out of the parking lot back to the road, we hear MUSIC blaring from the nightclub. They hit the main road with tires SQUEALING. Thelma starts to cry quietly. Thelma pulls off to the side of the road. Louise gets out and starts to walk around the car. She stops when she gets to the back of the car, and she is sick. Thelma waits in the car and moves over to the passenger side. Louise gets in the driver's side. Thelma's head moves almost imperceptibly. Louise studies Thelma's face. Louise looks at Thelma for a long time. Police cars are parked around. The activity has died down. In the back of a police car sits the Waitress with the door open. A DETECTIVE in a suit leans over the car door with his note pad. Louise did not realize she was doing it.",
    "503": "Louise slams the closet door. Thelma jumps. They are silent for a moment. Thelma is staring down the road. She puts her finger down on the receiver. Louise is hanging up the phone. She walks away towards the front of the store. Thelma comes out of the front of the store. Thelma and Louise look at each other while this sinks in. Thelma walks around to the side of the building to the phone. Louise goes into the store for a chocolate Yoohoo. Darryl is mad, but he's still watching the game. Thelma is trying not to cry. She's trying to be strong. Neither one of them say anything for a moment. She hangs up on him. Thelma has tears running down her face and she is watching the ground as she storms back to the car. So she makes a loud grunt as she slams into someone that she did not see. Both people are knocked back a few steps from the force of the collision. She notices how blue his eyes are. Now she wants him to come. He starts to walk away from the car. Just then Louise comes out of the store. She sees Thelma talking to this guy and, for one moment, stops dead in her tracks as she takes this in, then continues toward the car. Although her face is basically expressionless, we see that it's possible she might kill Thelma. The Hitchhiker just nods and starts walking towards the road. The guy does seem really nice and Thelma is really frustrated that Louise wouldn't give him a ride, but decides not to confront her. Louise lowers the top and backs the car out. They watch him walk away. Louise pulls out of the parking lot onto the road. They pass the Hitchhiker. He smiles and waves. They drive down the road. TIGHT SHOT of the Hitchhiker as the smile fades from his face. Thelma looking sulky. Hal goes over a list of every registered green T-Bird in the state. Names are scrolling by as Hal stares blankly at the screen. We see the name LOUISE ELIZABETH SAWYER scroll past. They are clear of the town. Thelma is like a dog with a bone. She just won't let it drop. Louise looks very shaken up. She keeps her eyes on the road but she's holding the steering wheel so tightly, her knuckles are white. Suddenly she reaches over and locks her door. EXTREME CLOSEUP of Darryl's face. J.D. is looking down the road, way off in the distance. Louise looks down the road and sees a highway patrol car coming down the road towards them. She glides along as the cop car passes on the other side without seeing them.",
    "505": "In perfect lip sync is. TIGHT SHOT of Darryl's face going deeper and deeper into a state of shock. TIGHT SHOTS of Hal, Max, etc., all looking intently at the screen. VIDEO IMAGE of Thelma boldly ordering cashier to fill her purse with money. As he's loading the purse with bills, she's taking beef jerky from the display and putting it in there, too, while she points the gun at the cashier. Thelma and Louise in car, driving. Louise looks at the speedometer touching 80 mph and lets her foot off the gas. Louise is looking a little nervous. Thelma howls like a dog and drinks a little bottle of Wild Turkey. As they get next to the truck, the truck driver is smiling and waving at them. They smile and wave back. He flicks his tongue at them. Louise screams. They both pause for a moment. As the sun sets, the T-Bird drives deeper into the vast desert. Darryl is sitting in the hallway. Two officers are leading J.D. down the hall. Hal, Max, other plainclothes officers follow. Hal thinks for a moment and then looks to Max. Max agrees and opens the door for the others to leave. He and Hal make eye contact before Max closes the door. Hal sits down across the table from J.D. and looks at him. They both just sit there for a moment. J.D. shifts in his chair. Hal walks over and opens the door and Max and the others straggle back in. The TV is ON and the place is a mess. Darryl, Hal, Max, and other cops spring into action as the phone RINGS, putting on headsets, turning on tape recorders. Darryl picks up the phone. Hal, Max, etc., all are gesticulating wildly. Thelma hangs up the phone. Everyone is very disappointed, taking off their headsets, turning off tape recorders and looking at Darryl like he's an idiot. Darryl still holds the phone in his hand. Thelma and Louise are staring at each other intently. Louise steps up to the phone. Again everybody springs into action. Darryl is fumbling with the phone. Darryl gives Hal and Max a look as if he's got it completely under control. Louise hangs up the phone. All are busy trying to see if the call was traced. Darryl is back in his recliner still in shock. She is stomping back to the car. Thelma follows doggedly. A moving van pulls in and parks in the b.g. Louise stops as she is about to get in and faces Thelma who's standing on the other side of the car. Louise yanks open her car door, gets in and slams the door and fires up the ENGINE.",
    "51": "REGGIE takes another cigarette from his pack, rips off the filter, and winces again as he puts it into her mouth. He points to the cigarette she just lit, still practically brand-new in the ashtray. She hands over the newer one to BARTHOLOMEW, who sadly examines its mutilated end while REGGIE returns to the first cigarette. The WAITER returns with the coffee and onion soup. DYLE leaves the hotel and turns into the Place. A moment later, REGGIE comes cautiously from the hotel. First comes DYLE, passing a sidewalk cafe on the corner, then the SANDWICH-MAN and REGGIE. A moment later, DYLE passes a GIRL painting a canvas, her easel set up in the middle of the sidewalk. He stops when he has passed her and turns to look at her work. REGGIE, not knowing what to do, and afraid she will be seen by DYLE, who is now looking her way, spins and sits at the sidewalk cafe's nearest table, her back to DYLE. It is already occupied by a middle-aged. The TOURIST, complete with camera, beret and guide book, looks up from his coffee, surprised. He stares at REGGIE and she stares back. He smiles back emptily, not knowing what to make of her. REGGIE turns to look at DYLE. He has made his judgment of the painting and now moves on. The TOURIST has finally found the courage to speak. As he opens his mouth to make a sound, REGGIE, her eyes on DYLE, rises quickly from the table and goes, leaving a very confused TOURIST with his mouth open. He blinks, then leaves some money on the table and starts after her. REGGIE following DYLE. Now we see that the TOURIST, in turn, is following her. She continues after DYLE. The TOURIST hesitates, then continues after her. He goes to the curb and starts to step off, attempting to cross the Rue Danton, but finds the light against him. He turns back in REGGIE's direction. Realizing she has to do something before DYLE spots her, she turns and takes the TOURIST's arm and starts walking with him back toward the cafe. She leaves him standing there, more confused than ever, as she starts after DYLE again. DYLE has hopped on the back of the bus as it pulls away. REGGIE hurries across the street, hailing a taxi. DYLE enters. DYLE walks to one of several windows. A sign over it reading. REGGIE comes down the stairs. Suddenly she stops. A confused look on her face. As his turn comes, he addresses the CLERK. Watching. The CLERK takes out a bundle of letters and quickly sorts through it. DYLE stops in his tracks, pondering what to do. CAMERA DOLLIES across an empty cabin to discover REGGIE in the third one, on the phone.",
    "511": "Banky carries a bag in one arm and pulls out his keys with the other. He picks up the mail on the floor. He jams them into the lock, opening the door. As he reaches the door and turns to look back at her, Alyssa pounces on him, grabs his face and locks lips with him, big time. He drops his keys and embraces her. And there they stand, by the side of the road, drenched kissing. He closes the door behind him and shuffles to the kitchenette, passing by the blanket-covered, slumbering forms of Holden and Alyssa, who are out cold in each other's arms. The place looks a mess - Like a couple of people were engaged in some tremendous fucking. Then he freezes. He looks down again, and drops his jaw and his carton of choco. It hits the floor with a pop. They look at one another, then at the flabbergasted Banky. Holden and Alyssa shoot straight up, eyes struggling to focus. Banky blinks. Then he shuffles toward the door again and lets himself out. Banky sits on a curb, staring into the distance, Holden saunters up and sits beside him. He follows Banky's gaze. Banky shoots him a glare. Banky walks away. Holden shakes his head. An all-girl gathering. TORY, NICA, DALIA and JANE help Alyssa finish an issue of 'Idiosyncratic Routine'. Tory letters a page. Nica and Dalia lay-out the artwork. Dalia drinks wine. Alyssa buries her face, giggling. They all cackle. Alyssa tries to laugh with them. Dalia stares at Alyssa, suspiciously. All four Girls stare at Alyssa, a bit horrified. Holden and Alyssa lie in each other's arms, moonlight bathing them. She smokes. Holden looks down at that book. He shakes his head at Banky and flips it open. On the page is Alyssa's Senior year photo. CUT TO COHEE LUNDON. In the PARKING LOT of FOOD CITY, addressing the camera.

    "514": "Mickey stares at the X-ray, horrified. Mickey is seen leaving the hospital. He strides slowly, his shoulders slouched, his hands in his pockets. His voice is heard over the screen as he crosses the street, continuing his self-absorbed walk on the opposite side. Occasional traffic goes by. Mickey brushes against a heavyset man who gives him a nasty look. Mickey is so dazed, he doesn't even notice. The dark bedroom is abruptly lit as Mickey, lying in his bed, wakes up with a start and turns on his night-table lamp. Mickey, still ruminating, stands up. Fixing his pants, he walks out of his bedroom loft into a dark upper hallway. He walks down a spiral staircase into the dark living room. The film cuts to a flashback of Mickey's past. Dr. Smith, sitting behind his desk, faces the camera. Rows of periodicals line the wall behind him. The camera moves to Dr. Smith's point of view: Hannah and Mickey, sitting on the opposite side of the desk. They look stunned. The camera moves back to the stunned Mickey and Hannah, following Dr. Smith with their eyes. Dr. Smith walks back to his high-backed leather chair behind the desk and sits down. As he talks, the camera moves closer and closer to his face. Mickey and Hannah walk on the sidewalk, oblivious of the passing pedestrians. Hannah, crying, blows her nose. Hannah sobs, clutching her tissue to her face. They walk offscreen and the film cuts to Hannah and Mickey's living room. The room is brightly lit; it's cluttered with pillows and plants. Norman and Carol, his wife, sit on the couch drinking coffee. Mickey walks from the kitchen into the living room, holding a half-eaten chocolate cake on a serving plate. The sun pours through the windows he passes. Hannah is briefly seen in the background, preparing more coffee in the kitchen. Mickey puts the cake down on the coffee table, which is already crowded with assorted plants, plates, and a bamboo tray holding utensils and napkins. Mickey sighs and flops down on an adjoining couch. He rubs his forehead. Norman chuckles. He starts to pace. Hannah, her hands clasped near her face, glances briefly at Carol. Hannah sighs. Mickey pauses for a moment, collecting his thoughts. Mickey stops his pacing and looks at the group. He starts to pace behind the couch anew. Norman and Carol remain silent. Mickey stops pacing and leans on the couch behind Norman. Mickey, rubbing his hands on his knees, leans back against the wall. Norman and Carol turn to each other, reacting. Carol glances at Norman. She chuckles nervously. He takes a sip of coffee. Hannah reaches for the cake as Carol and Norman exchange glances, reacting.",
    "517": "She runs into the building; the taxi drives away. Evan, his back to the camera, walks to the front door and opens it to Hannah. Through a doorway, Norma can be seen sitting on a chair in the kitchen. She wears a robe over a slip and stockings; she's drinking. Evan stands in the doorway looking at her; he doesn't go in. Norma reacts, turning to her daughter. Hannah, however, has her back turned. She is busy taking charge in the kitchen as Evan speaks. She takes some pills out of a cupboard and hands them to her mother with a glass of water. The camera moves to Evan, who continues to tell his story, ignoring his wife's outburst, as he walks away from the kitchen doorway into the den. Evan walks over to the piano, where several framed family photographs sit in a line on its top. He picks one up as Norma speaks offscreen in the kitchen. The camera moves back to the kitchen as Norma talks. She is still glaring offscreen at the doorway where Evan stood moments before. She holds the water glass and the pills. Evan is back in the doorway, listening to Norma, getting more and more angry. As he makes a retort, he starts to walk back to the den and his piano. Hannah goes back to Norma; she takes the glass of water away. Hannah, choosing to ignore Evan's remark, hands her mother a cup of coffee; she puts her mother's hands on the cup. Norma sips her coffee, softly sobbing. Hannah, reacting, walks away from the counter and, capping the bottle of pills, puts them back in the cupboard. The camera moves in on Hannah's face as she reflects, her voice heard over the screen. The camera leaves Hannah's face as she continues to reflect; it moves to the den, to the row of family photos on the piano: one of a present-day Evan and Norma, others where both Norma and Evan are young, beautiful, hopeful. The film cuts back to the kitchen. Norma stands up; Hannah takes her coffee cup and sets it on the counter. She puts her arm around Hannah's shoulder. Mother and daughter walk out of the kitchen. Norma chuckles. They stop at the entrance to the den. Evan can be seen playing the piano as they continue their conversation. Norma chortles. Hannah laughs, touching her mother. They walk over to Evan at the piano. Norma leans over the piano; Hannah looks off into the distance, deep in reflection. The piano music continues in the background as the movie cuts to: Lee walking along a wharf by the waterfront. The wind blows her hair; she hugs the Edward Estlin Cummings book to her chest.",
    "518": "She, too, is deep in thought. She stops at the edge of the wharf; the camera continues to move, to a group of wooden pilings nearby, lapped by the water. The piano piece ends and the film is quiet. The quiet continues as the film cuts to a close-up of a large, circular CAT-scan module in an antiseptic hospital room. A slowly moving stretcher, bearing Mickey's strapped prone body, begins to enter the round opening of the module. As the camera pulls back from Mickey, his taped head under the scan, two technicians can be seen through the window separating the scanner from the control room. One of them, sitting down, taps information into a computer while the other technician stands nearby, looking from Mickey to the computer screen. The movie then cuts briefly to the computer screen, showing an image of Mickey's skull. Scan lines bleep over the skull. The camera moves up from the screen to reveal Mickey once again, as seen through the window, silent and serious under the CAT-scan module. From Mickey's prone form, the film moves to the two technicians, as seen through the window in the scanner room. They examine the computer screen and talk indistinctly to each other. One of the men, nodding, taps more information into the computer. While they're studying the CAT-scan picture, the camera cuts to a back view of Mickey under the module. There is a science-fiction feel to this scene, as if Mickey is lying in the center of a huge, white, futuristic circle. The stretcher, bearing Mickey, slowly moves out of the module. Dr. Brooks, holding Mickey's X-rays, walks past a row of bookshelves to his light panel. He props up the X-rays. Dr. Brooks turns to an offscreen Mickey. The film quickly cuts to a close-up of Mickey's face, reacting in total despair. He closes his eyes; he covers his face with his hand. Once again, Mickey is seen leaving the building, but this time he bounds down the steps, jumping for joy. He runs swirling down the street, clapping his hands, happy with relief. Several cars pass as Mickey joyfully runs. Suddenly he stops, his hand to his mouth, reflecting. Gail sits in a chair in front of a bookshelf. Mickey, standing behind his desk, his back to the camera, his coat still on, looks out at the Manhattan skyline. Gail gets up from her chair. She walks past Mickey to a nearby cabinet. She opens a drawer, rummaging around for something. The camera follows her, leaving Mickey briefly. As Mickey continues to talk offscreen, Gail closes the cabinet drawer and walks to a file cabinet behind Mickey's desk. Gail opens the file cabinet and takes out a pack of gum.",
    "519": "She slams it closed, distracted. Gail sighs. She pops a piece of gum into her mouth as Mickey continues to speak. Mickey sighs. Pedestrians pass. The camera moves up the hotel's facade, past its welcoming flags, to its ornate windows several floors up. Elliot, his back to the camera, is opening the door to Lee. Elliot closes the door behind her as she enters. They stand very close to each other, framed by the door and a stark, subtly striped wallpapered wall. They walk towards the camera, further into the room. Elliot puts his arm around Lee. The camera follows Lee as she walks towards the curtained windows, past a fireplace, a mirror, some innocuous pictures, a delicate table holding a lamp, the foot of the bed. She parts a corner of the curtains, looking out the window, turning when Elliot speaks. He walks over to Lee by the curtained windows. He takes Lee into his arms. They kiss, their figures almost silhouetted in the warm glow of the room. Elliot takes Lee's coat off without breaking the kiss. They embrace. They kiss each other lightly, then stronger, more passionately, their embrace much tighter. The harpsichord music begins to play again as the camera moves over the bed covers to reveal Lee, lying contentedly under the sheets, her hair fanned out on the pillows, one arm near her head. He enters the screen, sitting down on the edge of the bed next to Lee. He holds a cigarette. Elliot chuckles; they hold hands. Elliot leans down to Lee; they begin to kiss passionately. Lee walks along the sidewalk in the rain; she's bareheaded. A car drives by; a pedestrian passes holding an umbrella. Lee passes a restaurant well lit inside by hanging lamps. The baroque music continues as she enters the loft, her head soaked. She closes the door, touching her soaking hair. Lee walks through the loft's living room area, unbelting her coat, towards the bathroom. She passes Frederick, who sits at a table in the kitchen area, drinking a cup of coffee and reading the paper. As he talks, Lee is seen turning on the bathroom light. She takes off her coat, hanging it on a hook, then begins to dry her hair with a towel. Frederick takes a bite of his sandwich and another sip of coffee as Lee walks out of the bathroom, tossing the towel down on the counter. She takes a kettle and fills it with water. As Frederick continues his monologue, Lee is busy in the background: striking a wooden match and lighting a burner on the stove for the kettle, taking a glass out of the cupboard, walking into the bathroom for some pills, filling the glass with water in the kitchen sink, and taking her pills.",
    "52": "REGGIE is on the phone. DYLE is on the phone. She opens the door of the cabin and starts out. As REGGIE steps out of her cabin and starts looking in the others. They are all occupied except one and she looks inside it. The receiver hangs by its cord, swinging back and forth. As she looks at it, confused. DYLE and SCOBIE stand together, waiting for the elevator, SCOBIE clearly holding a gun in the pocket of his raincoat. The self-service elevator doors open, one or two PASSENGERS come out and DYLE and SCOBIE enter. A young GIRL starts in after them. He reaches out and presses the top button with his metal hand. The doors close. As SCOBIE follows DYLE out of the elevator. SCOBIE looks around -- there is an open door at the end of a short hall. He and DYLE go to it, CAMERA FOLLOWING. Through the door, which SCOBIE closes behind them, is a flight of stairs, leading up to a second floor. DYLE yawns wide. DYLE gets to his feet and starts up the stairs, followed by SCOBIE. DYLE stops at the door. DYLE opens the door. The stairs continue up. A spectacular view of the Paris rooftops and the city lights beyond. DYLE and SCOBIE come out onto a level portion of roof. On the street side, the roof angles down abruptly into a steep, slate-covered pitch, broken only by two widely separated oval-shaped dormer windows. DYLE turns and looks -- there is nothing behind him but a sheer drop to the street. Moving quickly, DYLE lashes out and hacks SCOBIE's gun hand with the side of his palm and the gun falls to the roof. Following through, DYLE punches the large man full in the jaw, but instead of falling, SCOBIE wraps his arm around DYLE, holding on tightly until his head clears. Then, to his amazement, DYLE is lifted into the air and, unable to break the bear-hold, carried toward the edge of the roof. Working his arms between their two bodies, DYLE suddenly flails them out with all his strength and the hold is broken, but at the price of his coat and the flesh on his back as SCOBIE's metal claw rips through both, a wound extending from the center of DYLE's back to his shoulder. Both men look around for the gun, spot it simultaneously and leap for it, both landing short of the mark. Now they grapple with one another, each trying to break free and reach for the gun. Two hands, one real, one metal, inch toward the gun. The battle is going to SCOBIE whose weight and strength are beginning to tire DYLE, who is now on his back, trying to stop SCOBIE from crawling over him.",
    "523": "The two sisters walk away from the rack, Hannah slightly in the lead. Holly pauses, looking at her sister. They continue to walk. Holly looks at her sister for a beat. A female customer, who'd come over to the table, browsing through the rack of clothes near Hannah, looks up, reacting. She walks away. She walks past Holly and briefly looks at a different rack of clothes beneath the table. She walks offscreen to a nearby rack; the camera remains focused on Holly. Holly chuckles and begins to look through the scarves on the table. A group of theater executives, including the producer, the director, and two assistants, sit in a cluster in the empty audience, talking; they look up at the offscreen Holly, who is auditioning on the stage. The film moves from the audience to the stage where Holly, her hands clasped in front of her, continues to sing her song. A large group of other hopefuls are seen in the background behind her. The camera moves from Holly back to the executives in the audience. The camera has reached the executives in the audience. They are now chattering among themselves, Holly forgotten. A theater marquee can be seen on the busy street as Holly and April walk down the street towards the camera, moving closer and closer as they talk. Holly looks away sadly; she shakes her head. The film cuts to Father Flynn's rectory office. The Catholic priest looks out a simple stained-glass window, then turns to an offscreen Mickey. The camera moves back to reveal Mickey, his back to the camera, sitting in front of Father Flynn's desk. The movie cuts to Mickey's face. The camera cuts back to Father Flynn, who walks over to a leather armchair next to a table set for tea. He begins to pour the tea into china cups. Father Flynn clasps his hands in his lap. The film abruptly cuts to the long hallway in Mickey's parents' apartment. Mickey's mother stands in the front of this bureau at the hallway's end, screaming at the top of her lungs, holding her heart dramatically. His father walks into view, carrying a teacup and a candy dish. He strides past Mickey towards the kitchen. Holding the dirty dishes in his hand, Mickey's father looks at his son. Mickey's father walks offscreen again, to the kitchen sink. Mickey's father walks out of the kitchen, past his son, to the living room. Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway. He starts to pound it. Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen. He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door.",
    "525": "Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead. Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence. A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella. The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold. A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes. Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him. He's just entered his apartment. He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table. Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art. He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix. Then out comes a framed picture of a saint. It too gets put on the growing pile. Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise. Mickey sets them on top of the saint. Lee is walking down the street, looking around her. She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco facade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction. Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps. She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance.",
    "531": "The mirror shatters. Mickey, holding the rifle, is seen running over to the shattered mirror. Mickey runs offscreen briefly to answer the door. He returns onscreen, panting; he looks frantically once again around the living room. Occasionally, he is obscured by a tree trunk on the opposite side of the street; a few taxis go by as he talks over the scene. The movie cuts to the exterior of the Metro movie theater, with its smoked glass entrance doors and its Art Deco feel. An old publicity photo hangs inside. Mickey's reflection is seen at the almost-transparent doors, as well as the reflection of the street and various cars whizzing by. His reflection walks towards the theater entrance; he continues his story. Mickey walks into the movie house. He is seen through the glass doors, which still reflect the street and traffic outside. He makes his way through the lobby into the actual theater. The film abruptly cuts to the theater's black-and-white screen, where the Marx Brothers, in Duck Soup, play the helmets of several soldiers standing in a line like a live xylophone. The film cuts back to the black-and-white movie screen as Mickey continues to talk. The movie cuts back to Mickey, sitting almost obscured in the dark theater. As Mickey talks, the film cuts back to the antics of the Marx Brothers on the black-and-white theater screen. The four brothers are now swaying and singing and strutting, their voices indistinct over Mickey's narration. The film is back on Mickey's dark form in the audience. As Mickey continues, the film cuts back to Duck Soup on the black-and-white screen. The Marx Brothers are sitting on a judge's bench, playing banjos and singing with the other cast members. They jump down from the bench, still singing. The Marx Brothers kneel, strumming their banjos, and the movie cuts back to Central Park. They pass some people, a cluster of buildings that look like castles, and the Manhattan skyline as seen through the trees, as the camera moves back, farther and farther away from them, showing a beautiful Central Park, frozen in time. They stroll offscreen. Mavis passes the table, licking some food off her hand. Hannah, in the background, is busy by the stove. As Mavis leaves the kitchen, Lee enters, carrying some empty glasses. Norma walks over to a glass-doored cabinet and takes out a bottle of gin. Norma unscrews the liquor bottle and pours some into her empty glass as Hannah stops her mashing, reacting. The movie leaves the kitchen and cuts to the doorway between the dining room and the living room. Two women stand by the partially set dining room table, chatting and arranging some plates, as Elliot strolls into view, sipping a drink.",
    "537": "The movie cuts to Holly's point of view: the front seat where David and April sit, the Jaguar's windshield, and the passing lights and traffic of the street. Holly continues her ruminations as April leans over to say something to David. The film moves back to Holly in the backseat, still lost in thought. The screen cuts to black and a title appears. The movie briefly holds on a ripped, red, paint-splattered door as Elliot, wearing a raincoat, appears nearby. He looks down the street and the film cuts to his point of view: Frederick's loft building. The movie goes back to the impatient Elliot; he's looking around him. He glances at his watch as the film cuts back once again to the loft building, where Lee finally appears, walking down the street away from Elliot. A truck passes down the street. She walks further and further away; she turns a corner. Elliot frantically looks around again; then, in a burst of decision, he runs around a garbage dump, crossing the street, and still running, he moves down an adjacent street, past The Canal Lumber Company and several other buildings, as the film cuts back to Lee, walking down a different street, oblivious. The jazz plays on as the movie cuts back and forth between the fast-moving Elliot, rushing down the SoHo streets, past a truck waiting for a light to change, past some pedestrians, some garbage cans, turning corners, and the strolling Lee, walking up different streets, past different buildings. Lee eventually crosses a street, lost in thought, looking right and left, as Elliot, pretending nonchalance, waits on the corner, looking at his watch. She looks up in surprise; the music stops. They begin to walk down the street. She shrugs. They begin to walk again as the movie cuts to the interior of the Pageant Book & Print Shop, an old, serious bookstore. A nude print hangs at the end of one of the library shelf-like bookcases, which are packed, row after row, with books. An unseen Elliot and Lee carry on a conversation as the camera moves down an aisle, past the rows of books. Pictures hang on the aisle ends of the shelves. The camera moves past another aisle of books to reveal Lee, browsing through a shelf. She walks down a center aisle, the camera still in its parallel aisle, following her. Lee stops at the row where Elliot has been browsing. She is hidden by a shelf; only Elliot is seen as he talks to the offscreen Lee. Elliot starts walking down the center aisle, in the same direction Lee had walked up. He continues to talk to her as she remains offscreen in a nearby row.",
    "539": "Two Boy Scouts climb up the rocky base of the cliff. The two boys head down the passageway. It's dark, and the temperature drops several degrees. The light of kerosene lanterns dances on the tunnel walls ahead. The boys approach cautiously, careful to stay hidden. This is what they see: FOUR MEN digging with shovels and pick-axes. And the fourth man wears a LEATHER WAIST JACKET and BROWN FELT FEDORA HAT. Roscoe rushes forward and gives Fedora the box. Fedora steps toward a lantern resting on a rock. Fedora puts the box on the rock next to the lantern. Halfbreed pushes Roscoe as he jumps with excitement. Rough Rider steps forward to look at the box as Fedora opens it. Fedora takes a BEJEWELED CROSS from the box and holds it aloft. Fedora's comrades practically salivate at the sight of it. Indy takes off his hat and looks down at the off screen action. Fedora continues to admire the Cross, then places it on the rock next to its box and the lantern. Indy turns back to observe the men. A look of resolve comes into Indy's expression, and he turns back toward Herman. Instead, he watches in wide-eyed horror as a SNAKE SLITHERS ACROSS HIS LAP. Indy matter-of-factly picks up the snake and tosses it aside. Herman gasps. Indy grabs Herman's scout scarf and pulls him closer. Indy releases the scarf, gives Herman a pat and Herman dashes off. Indy sees the Cross on the rock next to the lantern. As the Robbers continue to search for additional valuables, Indy is able to work his way unseen to within arm's reach of the Cross. Fedora looks over at the men digging in a hole b.g. Indy picks up the Cross. As Fedora stands watching the other men digging, Indy puts the Cross in his pants and begins to pull himself up a rope hanging nearby. As he climbs, Indy's feet break a wooden beam, attracting the men's attention. The three Robbers are so eager to get their hands on Indy, they almost knock each other over in the attempt. Only Fedora is unperturbed. He casts a disgusted glance in the direction of his fleeing companions -- then sets off after Indy. Indy EMERGES from the darkness of the Pueblo into the brightness of day. He hears RUNNING FOOTSTEPS BEHIND HIM and dashes off. Rough Rider, Halfbreed, and Roscoe are quick to appear and run after him. Indy jumps from one rock to another; the SCOUT TROOP HORSES are below. Indy puts two fingers in his mouth and WHISTLES for his horse, who trots over. Indy puts the Cross in his belt. Indy PREPARES TO JUMP into the saddle. he JUMPS.",
    "540": "Cafe customers are startled to see Indy and Elsa climb out of the sewer, wet and smelly. Indy looks around at the postcard-perfect setting and smiles. Indy's delight, however, is short-lived since Kazim and two other Turkish agents are running towards them with drawn guns. He grabs Elsa by the hand and the two of them run down the dock and leap into a motorboat. Indy fires up the engine and pulls away from the dock, but not before a Turkish agent jumps in with him. Elsa grabs the wheel and begins to steer the boat while Indy and the Turk trade punches. Kazim and his men rush to two more speedboats tied to the dock. They chase after Indy. Indy grapples with the Turkish agent. As Indy grips his arms, we see a gun in the agent's hand. It fires. As Indy fights with the Turk, he becomes aware of the speedboats behind him and two enormous freighters ahead of him, joined together by two giant ropes. Indy, having gained the advantage, leans on top of the Turkish agent. Indy finally delivers the punch that sends the Turkish agent flying overboard. Turning, Indy sees that Elsa has committed the speedboat to a course between the two freighters, now being pushed even closer together by a tugboat. It's purely academic at this point since the hulls of the two freighters loom up on either side of them like cavern walls. One enemy speedboat chases Indy between the two freighters. It's a race for daylight as the two freighters drift ever closer to one another. Indy's speedboat just manages to squeeze through the gap. But the enemy speedboat explodes as it is crushed between the two freighters, flying into the air and splashing back down into the water. Spin their boat around in a sharp half-circle to see Kazim's speedboat appear racing toward them. He stands in the moving boat, firing a machine gun at Indy and Elsa. The two boats race across the water nearly side-by-side. A chattering machine gun from Kazim's boat splinters the wood of Indy's boat, until finally the rear of the boat catches. The machine gun runs out of ammunition. Kazim puts it down and takes control of the wheel from one of the Turkish agents in the boat with him. As Indy's boat drifts toward the giant, turning propellers at the stern of another steamer, Kazim's boat draws up alongside and hits them. Indy steps into Kazim's boat. He knocks one of the Turkish agents to the deck, then turns his attention to Kazim. The two men trade punches as the boat spins helplessly in the churning water. Indy kicks Kazim in the face, knocking him into the water, then pulls him back into the boat, now being sucked through the churning water toward the steamer's giant propeller blades.",
    "542": "THUNDER EXPLODES in the distance; lightning flashes. The Mercedes-Benz drives into the courtyard of the formidable stone castle. Indy reaches into the back seat and retrieves his bullwhip. He glances up to the beret Elsa is wearing. She reaches up and adjusts it. A BUTLER walks to the door and opens it to reveal Indy and Elsa standing outside in the rain. She now wears Indy's fedora; Indy is wearing Elsa's beret. Indy, followed by Elsa, steps inside, shaking the water from his overcoat. As Indy says this he pushes his way past the startled Butler, pulling a handkerchief from the man's pocket. Elsa follows, taking off her coat. Indy SNEEZES HARD. Indy dabs at his nose with the handkerchief as Elsa looks on in amused amazement. The Butler falls against a wall tapestry, sliding down to the floor, out cold. Indy and Elsa move cautiously and quietly down the wide, vaulted hallway. Indy and Elsa creep past a room full of NAZI SOLDIERS working around a large table with a map atop it. Indy reacts to the sight of them. Indy and Elsa continue down the hallway. Indy carries a gun in his hand and his whip hangs from his belt. He steps to a closed door and listens. Indy points out an ELECTRICAL WIRE. He studies the situation for a moment, then decides to enter one of the other doors. He knocks at the door -- there is no response. He looks back at Elsa and enters. The room is dark and empty. Indy throws open the window shutters and looks out. RAIN comes down in sheets. There is a wide ledge beneath each window -- but below that is a SHEER DROP. He leans out the window and wraps his bullwhip around some wires that protrude from the castle wall above the next window. Indy SWINGS from the window to the stone gargoyle. A PAIR OF WOODEN SHUTTERS seals the window. Indy takes hold of the bullwhip with both hands, pushes off with his feet. swings toward the shuttered window with his feet extended. CRASHING THROUGH THE WOODEN SHUTTERS as a CLAP OF THUNDER disguises the noise. Indy CRASHES THROUGH SHUTTERS AND GLASS into the room. Stunned, Indy sinks to one knee. and Indy's father, PROFESSOR Henry JONES, steps out of the shadows. Indy gets to his feet. Now they look at each other. Indy and Henry press themselves against the wall, Henry still holding the broken vase in his hand. Indy steps to the window and looks down. Henry moves to a lamp, holding the vase under the light for a closer look. Henry is all about the broken vase which he still holds in his hand.",
    "546": "Elsa is walking away in an open area, background of torches, vehicles, Nazi Officers. One of whom is now none other than Indy, coming up to her before she knows he is there. Indy pushes Elsa against a column and begins to search her clothing for the Diary. He pulls the book from Elsa's pocket. His hands fly to her neck. Indy releases her and backs away. She looks at him with a lover's pain. He moves over to Henry. They move off and almost run headlong into Hitler and his entire entourage coming down from the Podium. 50 kids push their autograph books for Hitler's signature. Hitler pauses to sign them. Hitler looks Indy's way. They make eye contact. Hitler breaks the spell by taking the Grail Diary from him, opens it to the first page and signs his autograph. He hands it back and moves on. Indy's motorcycle pulls up to the main terminal. A Plainclothes Agent distributes leaflets bearing HENRY'S PICTURE to Nazi Soldiers inside the terminal. Henry leans in a doorway reading a newspaper as Indy enters down the stairs and taps Henry's shoulder. They begin to walk toward the boarding gates. Henry looks over his newspaper at Indy. But Indy looks out the window and is suddenly concerned. Rushing across the tarmac toward the Zeppelin. Henry looks confused. Everyone else with a ticket quickly produces it and waves it in Indy's face. Vogel gets to his knees as the huge Zeppelin rises into the sky above him, revealing an airplane attached to the belly of the airship. Vogel shakes his fist at the rising Zeppelin. Henry opens his Diary and begins to thumb through it. Henry looks up from his Diary. He closes the Diary and leans back in his seat. Indy stutters uncomfortably as Henry stares at him, waiting for a response. Sunlight falls across the table from the window. The bar of sunlight turns like the hand of a clock over the tabletop across the drinks. We see Indy puzzled. Indy and his father emerge from the hatchway into the belly of the Zeppelin. The Zeppelin's elaborate metal framework is exposed. Indy and Henry hurry down the catwalk until arriving at a PAIR OF DOORWAYS framed into the Zeppelin's outer skin. We see plenty of blue sky and white clouds. We also see a small BI-PLANE that is suspended from the Zeppelin by a HOOK & CRANE DEVICE. Indy climbs into the cockpit of the Biplane as Henry takes the tail gunner's seat. Then they both become aware of a STRANGE SOUND in the skies behind them. TWO MESSERSCHMIDT FIGHTER BOMBERS streak out of the clouds and race across the sky. Shrink in their seats as the MESSERSCHMIDTS (going three times as fast as they are) SCREAM past on either side.",
    "548": "Indy and Henry run down the mountainside. Indy and Henry run to the shoreline. Indy reaches for his gun, tucked in his pants. He opens the chamber -- the GUN. Swings around and is coming in for another pass. Henry hands his case to Indy. Holding his umbrella, Henry suddenly spins around and runs screaming and shouting into A FLOCK OF SEA GULLS. The SEA GULLS take to the wing in flight. Thousands of them. MASSACRE! Sea gulls are shredded by the Messerschmidt's whirling propeller blades into a FEATHERY WHITE PUREE that SPLATTERS against the cockpit and CLOGS THE. ENGINE SPUTTERS. The Messerschmidt falls from the skies and EXPLODES in an OFF CAMERA SOUND EFFECT. Indy stands as before -- stunned -- a statue. Henry walks back to Indy. Indy wears a proud expression as he watches Henry walk down the beach. The Sultan is seated in his royal chair, flanked by Walter Donovan and Vogel and surrounded by his minions. Donovan holds the missing Grail Diary pages. Donovan and the Sultan walk together through an archway. The Sultan gets up from his chair and walks toward the trunk. He goes right past it and begins to inspect the Nazi staff car parked nearby. The Sultan points to the engine under the hood. and we see that it is Kazim, the spy at the court. Elsa is revealed coming down the stairs toward Donovan and Vogel. Sallah drives his car through the crowded streets, Indy beside him and Henry in the back seat. Sallah waves his arms and shouts to a CAMEL HERDER. Henry removes his hat and hits Indy with it. Elsa and Donovan's party -- consisting of a SUPPLY TRUCK, TANK AND VARIOUS OTHER VEHICLES -- all moving along through the ramble of this box canyon. Elsa, Donovan and Vogel travel in the open car. The TANK is a vintage World War I model with enormous treads. The Turkish soldiers wear native dress and carry both carbines and sabers. Brody sits alongside Elsa in the rear of the car carrying Donovan. Henry and Sallah are at Indy's side as he views Donovan's party in the distance. Parked nearby is a CAR containing all of their supplies. Then Donovan notices a reflection from the hills. At that moment the tank FIRES A SHELL in their direction. It WHISTLES overhead and BLOWS UP THE PARKED CAR. Indy, Henry and Sallah cover their heads as automobile fragments rain down upon them. Kazim peers over a rock, pointing his rifle at the group below. BULLETS EXPLODE off the vehicles and cliff. Donovan and Elsa duck. A NAZI SOLDIER falls from the tank as BULLETS EXPLODE around him. KAZIM'S MEN, BRETHREN OF THE CRUCIFORM SWORD, continue to FIRE.",
    "550": "But the horse moves exactly at the wrong moment and Indy lands flat on his feet in a standing position. Indy stands up and successfully mounts his horse. Fedora and his men arrive at the roof's edge in time to see Indy climb into the saddle and gallop off. Fedora puts two fingers in his mouth and whistles. A vintage truck and automobile come roaring out from behind the Pueblo, driven by two more gang members. The passenger in the car has his face concealed by the hat's wide brim. His arm is out the window, and we see an olive-colored hand protruding from the sleeve of an expensive white linen suit. Indy spurs his mount on to greater speeds but the autos not only keep pace with his horse. Indy veers off in a new direction, toward a railroad track. The train is barreling down the track. Indy rides up beside it and leaps from horse to train. He clings to the side of a boxcar, as Halfbreed and Rough Rider leap from the truck onto the train. Halfbreed tries to grab Indy, but Indy leaps onto another boxcar. Halfbreed runs after him but Indy leaps from the boxcar onto some covered boxes stacked on a flatcar. Indy loses his balance but regains it. With Halfbreed and Rough Rider still running after him, Indy enters the trap door and finds himself crawling on a catwalk suspended from the car's ceiling. Several feet below are numerous vats containing all manner of reptiles: alligators, crocodiles, giant lizards, etc. Then, Halfbreed enters through the trap door, followed by Rough Rider. Halfbreed grabs hold of Indy's feet, but Indy kicks at him and he loses his grasp. Indy crawls away, toward an opening on the opposite side. Halfbreed grabs at Indy's feet again; Indy rolls away and we see large bins of squirming snakes. The combined weight of the three people is more than the catwalk was intended for, and the bolts begin to rip from. Several bolts tear free, but it's Indy's end of the catwalk that drops down. He lands hard, with a splash into a vat of water, where he finds himself eye-to-eye with an enormous anaconda. The head of this snake is so damn big, it looks more like a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Roscoe appears atop the reptile car and manages to grab Indy. Indy kicks at him. Roscoe grabs onto the side of the reptile car as Indy moves on to. Indy climbs over canvas-covered circus equipment. Roscoe follows, grabbing a long stick with a hook on it. He reaches forward and trips Indy, who falls onto the roof of the rhino boxcar. As a lamp falls from the ceiling with the impact of Indy's fall, hitting a huge black rhinoceros.",
    "556": "The two struggle, rolling from side to side, coming perilously close to rolling right off the edge. Things get even more serious when Roscoe pulls a knife. Finally, he raises his head and thrusts his horn through the roof. As the horn smashes through the wood only inches from Indy's head, Indy and Roscoe stare at the horn in amazement as they continue to struggle. Smash! The horn comes up again -- right. Indy kicks Roscoe away. Roscoe rolls to the edge of the car but keeps from falling. Indy flips over onto his stomach. The wooden trap door explodes as a bullet is fired from within. The door is pushed open and Halfbreed and Rough Rider hurry out of the car. Indy gets to his feet -- looks ahead -- sees a water tank alongside the track directly up ahead. In an instant, he calculates his approach -- times the distance -- and leaps for the tank's water spout. He catches it perfectly, but his velocity causes the water spout to rotate a full 360 degrees. With Indy hanging on, feet kicking, the water spout deposits him back on the train, onto the roof of a stockcar, where he looks up to see Fedora walking toward him. As Indy edges away from Fedora, a portion of the stockcar's roof collapses and Indy falls through into the car below. Indy crashes down from above. Dust rises. The men, including Roscoe, pull Indy through the hole in the roof. He stands to face them as Rough Rider points a gun in his direction. Roscoe makes a grab for the Cross -- but Indy doesn't let go. A tug-of-war ensues until a snake wiggles out from Indy's shirtsleeve and wraps around Roscoe's hand. Roscoe screams bloody murder -- releases his grip on the Cross and tries to shake off the snake. He leaps onto the next car. Indy swings down to the caboose. He glances back at the men and quickly opens the door to the caboose, stepping inside. Fedora puts out his arm, gesturing for the others not to follow Indy. Which contains the circus magic equipment. Indy rushes to the rear door of the caboose but can't open it. He hears Fedora coming, and dives into a magic box. Fedora smiles confidently and advances toward the box. The box unexpectedly collapses; all four sides flop away. Fedora is mystified, frustrated and angered. He rushes out onto the balcony and sees: Indy running along the tracks, turning up a street of modest clapboard houses. Indy bursts through the front door holding the Cross in his hand. A Husky barks as Indy runs past in search of his father. Indy charges in.",
    "558": "Indy grabs a crowbar and fends off two sailors who attack him from the sides. Indy sees that the Cross is about to be swept overboard. He lunges for it. He snatches up the Cross only to be knocked down to the deck by a giant wave. He struggles to his feet, managing to avoid the giant fuel drums sliding across the deck around him. Several more drums come Indy's way. Indy turns around and pummels two sailors with one punch. Indy sees a large Stevedore's hook above him and he climbs up on crates to reach it. He grabs a hold of the hook and uses it to swing all the way across the deck, narrowly avoiding a huge wave behind him. He jumps into the rollicking ocean, still holding onto the cross. On the ship, a giant fuel drum rolls wildly, falling directly onto a crate of TNT. The crate explodes, causing the entire ship to blow, sending an enormous orange fireball into the sky. As bits of debris fall from the sky like rain. Indy bobs up in the water amid the debris, holding the Cross in his hand. He grabs for something to keep him afloat. Students walk along brick, tree-lined paths. Dressed in professorial tweeds, stands before his class. Laughter. Marcus Brody approaches Indy's classroom. He peers through the window in the door to see Indy completing his lecture. Brody enters the lecture hall and stands at the rear of the room. Indy stands at his desk as students begin to disperse. A pretty coed puts a note on the desk. Brody approaches as the last of the students leaves the lecture hall. Indy removes the cloth-wrapped Cross from his desk. He places it on the desk and takes off his glasses as Brody examines the Cross. Indy gathers up his books and makes his way toward the door. He turns back toward Brody, now holding the Cross. Indy takes the term papers then turns to enter his private office. Indy slips into his. Where he goes to his desk and finds a thick envelope with a foreign postmark on it. Then, Indy stuffs his mail into his coat pockets, goes to the window, slides it open and steps out into the garden. Indy escapes through the garden. Indy walks briskly toward the street; smiling, enjoying his freedom. As he arrives at the curb, a long black Packard sedan pulls up before him. Three men step out of the sedan. Indy is ushered into a large Art Deco apartment and left alone. Numerous museum-quality artifacts are displayed around the room. After a moment, Walter Donovan enters from across the room. During the brief time that the door is open, we hear a cocktail party going on in the next room: voices and soft.",
    "560": "A LIMO is parked beside a PRIVATE AIRLINER that bears the DONOVAN CORPORATE LOGO. Brody peers inside to Donovan and Indy. Indy opens the Grail Diary and thoughtfully turns through the pages. SUPERIMPOSED over a MAP that traces a course from New York City to Venice, Italy. Indy and Brody disembark from the Water Bus onto the Boat Landing as other Gondoliers steer their boats in the water. Suddenly a WOMAN comes up to him. Attractive features. Blonde hair. Eyes that are bright and intelligent. She looks at him with an appraising expression that is brazenly flirtatious. Indy grins, enjoying the repartee. The Woman turns to Brody, who tips his hat. The Woman, DR. ELSA SCHNEIDER, extends her hand to Brody. Indy's grin fades. Brody registers a look of surprise. Indy, Brody and Elsa walk along the narrow canal, lined with buildings on either side. As they cross over a bridge to the opposite side of the canal, Indy steals a flower from a street vendor. He holds it out to Elsa. She hands a slip of paper to Indy. Indy extends the scrap of paper to Brody. Elsa leads Indy and Brody into the large piazza. People walk about and sit at tables in front of a large building. They have arrived at the front steps of the library. Elsa leads the way inside. Indy, Brody and Elsa enter, their heels CLICKING across the marble floor. We notice, along with Indy and Brody, that the library contains many stained-glass windows. She indicates FOUR HUGE MARBLE COLUMNS that go from floor to ceiling. Indy glances at the Columns, then notices a stained-glass Window that depicts a Knight of the Crusades. Indy lingers for a moment in front of the window. The minute Elsa is out of earshot. Indy whips out the Grail Diary and opens it to the sketch he noticed in the airplane. Brody glances at the Diary, then at the window -- noticing that the Roman numerals in question have been worked into the window's design. He's looking in five directions at once. His eyes moving across the walls and ceilings -- charged with the thrill of discovery. Indy's eyes travel up one of the four huge marble columns. Indy looks again to the stained-glass window. He points. Indy has discovered that each Column is numbered with a Roman Numeral. Indy hurries away toward Column VII. He points again to the stained-glass window. He looks down to the scrap of paper in his hands. Indy walks past aisles of book-lined shelves. He stops, turns, then looks down. He climbs a spiral staircase leading up to a LOFT and looks down at Brody and Elsa. Indy rushes down the staircase and goes to the CENTER TILE where the two sides of the X intersect.",
    "563": "He squirts some wiper fluid onto the glass, which clears it up a bit, but now he sees something worse up ahead. It's a grouping of headlights, eight of them, all pointed at him, sealing off the road. He bites his lip and calls over his shoulder, to the back of the van. He speaks in Spanish, which is subtitled. The Agents fling open the rear doors, revealing a DOZEN FRIGHTENED MEXICANS, hopeful immigrants without official permission. Agent Janus looks at the Driver, who's now held by two other Agents, and shakes his head. He stops in the middle of his sentence, as another car is approaching, fast, its engine WHINING as it barrels down the road toward them. The new car pulls a hard right, goes off the road, spins around the INS cars, and SQUEALS to a sideways halt, silhouetted in front of their headlights. It's a boxy, black 1986 Ford LTD. TWO MEN get out, dressed in plain black suits, crisp white shirts, simple black ties, shiny black shoes. KAY, fiftyish, is the apotheosis of world-weary; his partner, DEE, mid-sixties, is just weary. They approach the INS agents. Kay and Dee move past him and approach the row of nervous immigrants. He walks down the row, studying the faces, greeting each one cheerily in Spanish. Silence on the road. The others pile into the rear and they tear out of there. Kay and Dee escort their captive across the road and over a small rise, leaving the stunned INS agents standing alone in the roadway. He pulls out a small laser device, which he ZIPS neatly down the front of the man's clothes. The man's clothes fall to the ground, revealing what he really is underneath -- A SCALY SPACE BASTARD, about four-and-a-half feet tall, with a snout, snail-like tentacles, and independently moving eyes on stalks at the top of his head. It's propped up by a stick, like a puppet, and it continues to make expressions as he holds it. MIKEY replies -- an unfathomable combination of GRUNTS, SQUEAKS, and saliva. Mikey makes a lame SQUEAK. From behind Mikey, they hear a terrified GASP. Kay and Dee both look over quickly. One of the alien's eyes, on a tall stalk, whips around too. All three of them see AGENT JANUS, standing just over the rise, staring in frozen amazement. Janus freezes, terrified. Dee struggles to roll over and change the controls on his gun, which fell out of his hand as he hit the ground. The other INS Agents burst over the rise, SHOUTING questions. From over the rise, car engines WHINE in the distance and headlights start to flash around them. Kay reaches into his pocket and pulls out a tubular metallic device the size of a pocket recorder.",
    "564": "Kay pulls out a box of matches and strikes one on the side. He raises it to his cigarette, but as it draws close, the match goes out with a sharp. Kay looks up, sharply. Above him, TONY, the counter guy, is stuck to one high corner of the ceiling by an enormous wad of viscous, dripping fluid. He's dead, a frozen look of terror on his face and the can of Raid still clutched in his hand. Laurel is at the end of her rope. Jay's smile vanishes and his jaw drops as he figures it out. He starts to reach for his gun. Kay races into the morgue just as the examination table EXPLODES into the air, revealing EDGAR, who was hiding beneath it. Now everything happens at once. Jay leaps back and draws the Noisy Cricket, Kay pulls out his series four deatomizer, and Edgar holds his shotgun under Laurel's chin, using her body to shield his own. Edgar backs away with Laurel, further into the morgue, toward a glass window that looks out at the base of an air shaft. Jay and Kay advance, slowly, cornering him. And with that he turns, leaps -- -- and CRASHES right through the window, into the air shaft. EDGAR, still clutching LAUREL, EXPLODES up over a railing. Jay and Kay duck into the air shaft and look up -- too far to climb, and the walls are smooth anyway. And Jay starts running down the street, where DOZENS of cabs are waiting at the intersection. He's running from cab to cab, pounding on windows, scaring the living shit out of people. Jay and Kay rush in from the door under the World's Fair mural, and head toward the main display screen; all around them, the MIB staffers are in frenetic activity in response to the threat from above. Just then, a loud ALARM wails. AT THE MAIN VIEWING SCREEN, A GREEN LINE shoots out from the Arquillian ship, striking a region of planet earth. -- headquarters, where every bell, whistle and light imaginable is going off. Viewing the screen, it now reads. Kay and Zed both look up at once, scowling. They follow his gaze, up, over the computer terminals. There, on the wall in front of them, where it has loomed for the entire movie, is the enormous mural of the 1964 World's Fair grounds. Most prominent in the mural are two tall towers that rise dramatically from the ground, topped by -- -- the two flying saucers from the very first alien contact. As they stand there, wide-eyed, staring at it, we. -- the real-live twin towers on the actual fairgrounds in Flushing Meadows. A taxi SCREECHES to a halt at the edge of a fence a hundred yards away.",
    "569": "One of the Worm Aliens answers him in their native tongue and points to the counter. The elevator doors slide open on Men in Black headquarters. Edwards just stares, fascinated, but Kay grabs him by the arm and hurries him along. Inside, there are piles of sophisticated-looking devices stacked on shelves and tabletops. Edwards picks up a small yellow ball from one of the shelves. They leave the room. On the main floor, they walk briskly across the room, reaching a giant screen on the far wall. The screen displays a map of the world on which thousands of tiny lights blink in all parts of the globe, log lines of data flashing next to them. On the screens, we see live images of aliens. Bony fingers. Edwards, stunned, looks at Kay as 4-Eyes boots her onto the screen: Mean face, cat glasses. Zed, who was standing up close to the screen, walks over to Edwards, sizing him up. Zed's voice comes over. Edwards reaches out and opens a white locker, revealing a black suit hung from a hanger in the middle. On the bottom, a pair of shiny black shoes. Kay is at a computer terminal. On screen are Edwards's birth certificate, driver's license, social security card, library card, everything. Zed's voice continues. Edwards stands in a cramped white booth. He holds both his hands on a ten-fingered keypad, pressing down hard. The pad glows red, a searing sound comes from his hands, and he grimaces as more lasers instantly and (not at all) painlessly change his fingerprints. One by one, Kay deletes Edwards's identity cards. On the computer screen is Edwards' full name -- James Darrel Edwards III. Kay punches a couple keys, and the cursor begins to sweep from right to left, starting to eliminate the rightmost letters of Edwards's name. More letters are eliminated from his name. A tie pushed up. Looking slick and handsome in his extremely sharp suit, James D Edwards III -- or, rather, Jay -- steps into the doorway from the locker room. He slips on the sunglasses. The Older Man (Rosenberg), is carrying a cat and an ornate rosewood jewelry box. Carefully, he sets the box down and lovingly places the cat on top of it while he locks all five locks on the door to his distinctive shop. A flap of skin, now getting gray and crusty with age, hangs off Edgar's neck as he sits in the front of his Orkin van. Across the street, Edgar sees a short, older man come out of one of the jewelry shops on Thirty-Fifth Street. That finished, he picks up the cat, then the box, then waddles off down the street, one under each arm.",
    "57": "Evelyn is breathing very deeply now. She lifts her head and looks up at him. He's genuinely puzzled. Gittes sighs. She begins to cry softly. Gittes looks over to Evelyn. Her hair covers most of her face from him. There is a long moment of silence. She nods. He gets out and slams the car door. The spray is hitting him full on the top of the head. Gittes is so exhausted he's literally holding onto the nozzle as the water pours down. He shuts the shower off, reaches weakly for a towel, dabs his nose lightly with it. Pads around in elegant silk pajamas. He walks over to the window where morning light is streaming in. He closes the curtains, collapses on the bed, on top of the covers, inert. Gittes lets it go on for a moment, then picks it up without saying anything. Gittes slowly rises to one elbow. He hangs up, falls back down. Gittes swears, picks it up. Before Gittes can say anything, the phone clicks dead. It is a bungalow courtyard with a very narrow walkway and sickly green stucco. Gittes at the front door. It's slightly ajar. He knocks. He opens it and enters. Morning light filters through the half-open blinds. Dust particles in the shafts of light. It's still and empty. Gittes sees something down the hall, under the legs of a telephone table. Gittes moves toward it. It is grotesque. When he gets closer he can see it's a wilted head of lettuce. Just inside the kitchen some radishes and onions lie on the linoleum. Gittes walks on into the kitchen. Clearing the kitchen counter, Gittes sees IDA SESSIONS lying on her back on the floor, surrounded by the groceries from a broken bag. Ice cream has melted around her. Her eyes are open, a stream of ants is moving across the ice cream and into her mouth. She's recognizable as the woman who posed as Evelyn Mulwray. He gingerly opens her handbag, fishes for its contents, takes them and looks at them on the kitchen counter. Wallet with a few bills in it, driver's license with her name. A Screen Actors Guild card. Gittes nods, turns, carefully replaces the items in the purse. He idly opens the broom closet, pantry, and even Frigidaire, which is all but empty. Then he steps over her body and moves across the hall to a door that is slightly ajar. Gittes enters and turns on the light. Escobar and another PLAINCLOTHED MAN stand in the bathroom by the entrance to the bedroom door. Gittes turns around. A THIRD MAN is now coming down the hall from the bedroom. The Assistant starts to move for Gittes who is ready for him.",
    "570": "Edgar drops the truck into gear and follows him, slowly, trolling along behind him. Zed's office is a circular, windowed room elevated above the main floor of MIB headquarters. JAY and KAY sit across the desk from Zed. There are five video monitors on a wall behind Zed's desk, and on each monitor is another Man in Black, in different parts of the world, the city name and a clock ticking in a corner of the image. While Zed talks, he goes through paperwork on his desk. Next to him, his computer screen BEEPS importantly. Zed looks over at it. JAY and KAY come out the front of MIB headquarters. ROSENBERG, the jewelry store owner, steps out of a cab in the meat-packing district, still carrying the ornate box and his beloved cat. A moment later, the Orkin van pulls to a stop across the street. He heads into Leshko's, a Russian diner. ROSENBERG comes into the tiny restaurant, squinting in the relative darkness. At a table in the middle, he sees a man eating alone -- an enormous, dignified, yet profoundly strange-looking man in his mid fifties. Rosenberg walks carefully over to the table, but does not sit down. He steps forward, to face Rosenberg, who sets the ornate box on the table. Rosenberg and the Arquillian stare at each other for a long moment -- -- and then embrace each other. The embrace has an odd, formal quality to it, like mafiosi coming to a sitdown. They hold on, long and hard, and both seemed choked with emotion. Finally, they break apart and take their seats. They speak in a bizarre alien tongue, which is subtitled. The Driver hands over some documents. The guy digs out two other cards and hands those over. MRS. REDGICK is in front, MOANING in pain, holding her swollen belly. Kay straightens up, fast. Mrs. Redgick SCREAMS again. Redgick gets out of the car, worried. Suddenly a TENTACLE whips out from between Mrs. Redgick's legs, CRACKS the whip once, and wraps around the door post, grabbing hold. Now a SECOND TENTACLE whips out, but this one wraps around Jay's neck and pulls tight. Jay looks down at the creature COOING and nestling on his chest. It vomits on him. Back in the car, JAY wipes the last of the puke off his suit while KAY starts up the car. CLOSE ON on various supermarket tabloids as a hand flips through them. Kay is furiously searching through the tabs; Jay is standing behind him, a little embarrassed. Kay pulls a copy of the Weekly World News from the stand and gives the guy a buck. He SMACKS the paper down on the hood in front of Jay, the pages turned open to a headline in typeface so large one would think it reserved for the Second Coming.",
    "577": "She is shocked, embarrassed, pleased, conflicted, an instant and wide spectrum of emotions. Joe is happily confounded by all the interaction. Joe has heard Susan's question but, as he studies her, doesn't answer. Drew reacts to this allusion of intimacy. Joe rises, follows Parrish to the door, stops. Joe pivots, and he follows Parrish out the proper door. Parrish turns back to the bedroom. Joe tests the springs. Coyle regards his peanut butter sheepishly. Joe raises the spoonful of peanut butter in a kind of toast to the staff. A spectacular indoor Olympic pool, window commanding views of the skyline. Susan is swimming laps, looking very professional in a black Speedo suit, Joe wanders in, still licking his peanut butter. He observes her, but she is unaware of him, however now, as she makes a barrel turn, his shadow falls over a reflection from a window, she aborts her lap, looks up to see who it is. Susan climbs out of the pool, gets halfway up the ladder, points to a stack of towels. Joe turns to the towels, but one hand is occupied with the spoonful of peanut butter, he shifts it to the other hand, can't manage the huge Turkish towel one-handed, now implants the spoon in his mouth, lifts the towel with both hands and presents it to Susan. Joe continues to nibble at his peanut butter. He finishes the spoonful. He shifts the spoon from hand to hand, starts to stick it in his pocket, realizes this is inappropriate. Susan holds her hand out to him, he places the spoon in it and she sets the spoon on the table with the towels. She watches, fascinated, as Joe licks his gums, enjoying every last bit of his spoonful. Parrish regards Joe, the tie is a sorry mess now, a batwing of silk stretching across his collarbone. Parrish is startled, he regards Joe carefully. Silence as Joe considers the point, Parrish quickly crosses to him, undoes the tie, and now begins tying it for him. He has now, with some difficulty, completed the tying of Joe's tie, adjusts it beautifully on Joe's collar, then spins him around in front of a mirror. Joe, catching sight of his own appearance, rises to the balls of his feet, quite taken. They stride on, cutting through the crowd, Joe all at home in his new surrounding, but Parrish just the opposite, uncharacteristically uncomfortable, phrases forming on his lips but unspoken, then suddenly he blurts out. Jennifer wheels and heads right back to the office as Parrish arrives at the door to the Board Room. Parrish hesitates, nods, conceding the point, reaches for the doorknob. Parrish enters, Joe following right behind him.",
    "580": "Parrish, in a state of shock, doesn't answer for a moment. He starts up the stairs. Joe waits guardedly at the bottom of the stairs as Parrish descends. Joe senses Parrish's tone, doesn't answer. Parrish measures Joe. Parrish's jaw sets. Susan seems distracted. Parrish blinks, stares down at his cards. There is something in Susan's tone that lets him know not a word has sunk in. Quince sips the red, now the white, now he pours some of each into one glass. Quince smiles, nods embarrassedly. He drains his wine. Joe regards Quince. Quince drains one more glass of wine. He heads out, Parrish and Joe fall silent. Joe is silent for a moment, cogitating. Parrish is beginning to reach Joe. Joe makes his way down the path from Parrish's study, a weight on his shoulders, his step measured, within himself until he is hit by the lights and laughter and MUSIC of the party. Joe blinks, at a loss. She waits. He kisses her, they fall into a deep embrace. Joe is struggling with a response, finally, inevitably, he drifts into a long silence. Susan is beside herself, her emotions tossed in every direction, Joe steadies her. She smiles wanly, Joe leaves her. Parrish is seated by the window, lights from the party flashing past, the MUSIC and laughter audible but muted, the fever of the celebration lost on him, within himself. Joe enters, Parrish looks up. Parrish waits. Parrish regards him sympathetically. The silence is broken by a KNOCK on the door. Quince appears, flushed with excitement. Parrish weighs the information for a moment. Quince exits, Parrish presses the button for the speaker- phone. Quince leads the way through the lights and MUSIC. Drew, fashioning an imperial entrance for himself, hails partygoers as he passes, Quince enjoying the irony. Parrish is at his desk, Joe in a distant corner of the room. Drew enters with Quince, Quince nods, excusing himself, and closes the door behind him. Drew takes a seat. Joe can no longer control himself. Parrish is struck dumb. He looks at Joe pleadingly, shaking his head imperceptibly, but Joe nods to him blithely -- and then commandingly. Drew is all attention. Joe steps forward. Parrish clicks the speakerphone off. Drew is staring at Joe, shaking his head. Parrish hesitates, waves and steps away, APPLAUSE that grows into CHEERS, the music resumes, another dance tune. Quince grabs him, pumps his hand and claps him on the back. Now Parrish spots Allison, he wraps her in a tight embrace, they hold each other close for a moment, but then are separated by a surge of guests. Parrish sees Susan, she smiles but there is a tinge of sadness about her.",
    "583": "Trina smiles and looks at the passengers from her jump seat. Whip takes the phone. Nicole gets out of the car and runs up to the second floor of a small run-down apartment complex. She pulls out a key as she reaches the door, only to discover it is slightly open. She smiles at him. He stands in the doorway. She kicks the door closed. She flings her bag on a table, and it hits a box which falls and scatters its contents. She spots a syringe. Whip speaks into the intercom. He pours the contents of a small vodka bottle into a juice container hidden from the passengers' view. He tosses three miniature bottles as he grabs the spiked orange juice. He takes a long drink as Margaret exits the toilet and he goes in. In Nicole's apartment, framed photographs on the table show a younger, smiling Nicole with her mother. Nicole lightly taps the syringe. Then pushes out a small drop that slides down the needle. She tightens a tourniquet around her arm and holds the end securely in her mouth. She positions the needle and injects. Her arms relax and she lets go of the syringe. She leans back, eyes closed. The strap falls from her mouth. Her head lulls to her shoulder. Her dilated pupils shrink to tiny dots. She grabs the packet of cocaine that Kip gave her and falls on her side. The packet falls inches from her hand. Her fingers reach out, but only push it away. Her hand goes still as feet appear under the door. In the cockpit, Whip sleeps with paper covering his eyes and his sunglasses over the paper. Ken's yoke jerks away. The yoke slips out of Ken's hands as Whip struggles to gain control and the plane begins to dive. The wheels of the aircraft unfold. In the galley, Margaret grabs the phone. Margaret unbuckles her seat belt. Alarmed passengers grasp the seat in front of them as a flight attendant tries to assist someone. Cammie falls and hits her head. Cammie lies still. Whip banks to the left. The plane turns upside down. She slides the side-stick forward. One wheel gets stuck while retracting. Inside the cabin, Cammie comes to a rest on the ceiling. Trina sees a young boy slip out of his seat. Outside Georgian Gardens, a medical aide wheels Nicole beside Fran as the upside down plane flies past. Trina crawls to the boy and straps him back in his seat. A light flashes on the control panel in the cockpit. The plane turns upright, and the still-unconscious Cammie falls on some passengers. Trina loses her hold and falls against the bulkhead. Fire and smoke billow from the left engine.",
    "585": "He enters Whip's room with a video camera as a nurse helps Whip from the bed exposing his buttocks. The nurse leaves the room. Harling places his hand on Whip's head and leaves. Whip closes his eyes. Whip is startled awake. He looks around the dark room, then, clicks on the light. He peeks into the corridor as a nurse walks by the reception desk. He quickly limps down the hall using a cane. He sees Nicole sitting on the stairs smoking a cigarette. She rises to leave. She sits. Whip leans against the wall facing her. He lights a cigarette. She shakes her head. A patient climbs the stairs. Nicole tosses her pack. The gaunt man stands by his IV pole. She shakes her head. She glances at Whip. The bold man turns to Whip. Cigarette hanging out of his mouth, the man picks up the IV pole and walks down the stairs. She wipes a tear from her eye, offers a smile, then stands and climbs up the stairs. A black Cadillac lurches out of the hospital parking structure and passes the news crews parked outside. Harling opens a beer and takes a swig. He hands Whip a package. A bundle of cash. A car turns into a dirt driveway. The car passes a dilapidated shed on the right and pulls up to large older farmhouse. Whip stops the car. Whip places a bag beside the door and reaches above one of the wooden posts supporting the veranda roof. He grabs a hidden key. He enters a cozy, fully furnished living room and looks around. A retro stereo sits on a cabinet against the wall with framed photos. Whip, his eyes still covered by a bandage, looks around. Whip carries a plastic bag into the kitchen and places it on a dining table. He plugs in a charger and checks his iPhone. It shows 127 voice messages. He leans on a bureau and pulls out a prescription bottle from his pocket. He glances at the pills, then, at a decanter of whiskey. Another liquor bottle's near the stereo. He licks his lips and clenches his jaw. Using a cane for support, he strides into the bathroom and dumps the pills down the toilet. He collects the bottles of liquor and the decanter and turns on the stereo. He empties the bottles in the sink. Then, he dumps the empties in the garbage. He takes a case of Corona and some other beer cans from the fridge, and also, drains them. He dumps the cans in a bin. He takes a bag of marijuana from a wooden box in a drawer and flushes it. He continues his chore with determination as he moves from cabinet to cabinet, removing and tossing bottles and cans.",
    "588": "Whip stands in a dark suit and watches the procession pass. A young boy touches Whip's arm. Whip turns around and sees Margaret. He goes to her and they hug. Margaret reaches for her son and pulls him close. Both watch as Trevor goes off to find his dad. They hug again. She looks at him with tears in her eyes. They stare at each other, unmoving. He wipes her tears with his thumb. Margaret watches him, her brow creased and her eyes soft with sympathy. He kisses her and leaves. Whip leans against his car in a parking lot and watches an airplane overhead. Nicole approaches in quick strides. They hug. She hands him a Zippo. He sticks a cigarette in his mouth. A man stands at a podium. Whip sits semi-slumped in a chair. The majority in the room lift their hands, including Nicole. Whip crosses his arms. Whip leaves. Whip parks outside a bar and walks in as his co-pilot, Ken, appears on the news. Whip exits the bar. At the hospital, Whip walks over to a private room and peeps in. He taps his cane on the door frame. A nurse dresses Ken's wounds. Vicky and Ken look toward Whip. Ken turns to the nurse. Ken's left leg lies on a brace. Whip closes the door. He sits down. Whip arises to leave. Ken reaches for Whip's hands. Whip's eyes dart up and down. He takes Ken's hands. Later at Whip's family farm, Nicole sees the lights on in the hangar. Whip leans over the Cessna. Still wearing his tie, his shirt's sleeves rolled up. He jumps off a ladder and hustles over to Nicole, kissing her. He sips his beer. She notices cocaine on the table. Nicole sits on the bed. She ends a call and continues packing her things in the bedroom. She ignores Whip. Whip takes a large swig before the setting the bottle on a table and entering the bedroom. Nicole walks past Whip, raising a hand to her head before she sits on the bed. He sits next to her on the bed. She leans in and their foreheads touch. He kisses her and she allows him to pull her into an embrace. In the morning, Whip lies sleeping on the bed fully dressed. Nicole stands at the bedroom entrance and looks at him. She leaves an envelope with Whip's name on it between his lighter and a bottle of whiskey. She carries a suitcase and a basket, and walks away from the house. Sheila's van is parked behind some trees and Nicole puts her things in. The van drives off. Whip stops as he sees the envelope, then, trots over to the table and picks it up, opening it.",
    "595": "Holding a small tin and a pair of scissors, he attempts to cut a piece of plant. It waves its vine-like tentacles. Harry walks past and spots him. He approaches and gives Slughorn a fright. He walks away. Slughorn glances around furtively. Harry walks up a grassy hillock. Slughorn lags a little way behind. Ahead, he sees Hagrid, his dog, and Harry by the corpse of a colossal spider. Harry demonstrates with his fingers. A bit of spider breaks off. Slughorn drops it on the ground. Slughorn looks up at the giant Hagrid. Slughorn bows his head and closes his eyes. In Hagrid's cottage. Harry applauds the tipsy duo. Hagrid's eyes closed and his head tilts back. It thuds against the high-backed chair. Harry grins. Slughorn looks across the room at Harry. His smile fades. Harry gulps and stares at the old man. The scar on his forehead. He stands up. Wide eyed, Slughorn gazes at the boy standing before him. He blinks and his eyes moisten. Slughorn presses the tip of his wand against his temple. He closes his eyes then pulls the wand away. Attached to it is a wisp of vapor, the memory. His hand shaking, he holds up a small test tube. As he inverts the wand, Harry steady Slughorn's hand. The memory drops into the container. In his study, Dumbledore pours it into the pensive. The memory begins with the hour glass. The teenage Tom Riddle turns away from Slughorn and walks towards the fire, hands behind his back. Tom fiddles with a ring on his finger. He turns to face Slughorn. Slughorn looks into the boy's cold eyes. The memory ends. Dumbledore holds up a hand to silence Harry. Looking troubled, the professor walks away from the pensive. He crosses his study and sinks down onto a short flight of steps. Dumbledore hurries to his desk. He holds it up. Harry touches the ring. It spins. Images of the teenage Tom, the boy in the orphanage, the pebbles on the window ledge, the postcard of the coast, Voldemort. The ring stops spinning. Harry flexes his neck. Dumbledore moves around the desk and looks closely at Harry. Harry breathes deeply. Snape abruptly leaves the astronomy tower. Descending the stairs, he meets Harry who has overheard his exchange with Dumbledore. He stops in front of Harry for a moment then continues his descent. Harry climbs up to the upper platform. Harry rubs his chin self-consciously. They walk to the balustrade. Harry nods. Harry hesitates. Harry places his hand on Dumbledore's arm and they shoot off the tower. White-tipped waves roll towards a pinnacle rising out of the sea. Harry and Dumbledore stand on top of it.",
    "604": "Hermione puts one arm over Harry's shoulder, the other over Ron's. Ahead of them, Katie Bell lies on her back in the snow. Her body is wrenched from side to side. She shoots up into the air and hovers with arms outstretched, her mouth open in a muted scream. She crashes down onto the snow and lies on her back, her head shaking. Hagrid arrives on the scene. They step aside, and the giant Hagrid picks Katie up. Harry walks towards something lying on the ground. A necklace of blue stones lies on the snow, tipped out of its box. Harry folds back the wrapping paper. Back inside its box, the necklace lies on a desk. Professor McGonagall studies it, then turns to Leanne. Hermione, Ron and Harry face McGonagall. Snape arrives. Snape waves his wand and the necklace rises into the air. McGonagall looks at Snape. The others stare at him. Harry is the last to lower his gaze. Harry lies on his bed with the Marauder's Map. He sees Malfoy moving on it. Ron's lying in bed with his hands behind his head. Both boys look uneasy. Harry takes off his glasses and puts them on the map on his bedside table. Malfoy disappears from the map. Professor Slughorn's supper party. Twin girls look round at Hermione. Everyone's enjoying dessert. The door opens and Ginny comes in. She's been crying. Harry is the only one to stand as Ginny comes to the table. He grins politely as he bends down to retrieve his napkin. Hermione watches him. Cormac, his eyes fixed on Hermione, sucks his little finger suggestively. Embarrassed, she turns away. Slughorn turns, and his eyes open wide. Harry stares at the photographs. Taken aback, Slughorn stands rooted to the spot. Harry gives a faint smile. The sand in the hourglass drifts in a slow spiral, from top to bottom. It's held upright by snakes with green glass bodies and golden heads. Ron is kitted out in his Quidditch gear, including his leather helmet. He enters the Great Hall. Looking totally miserable, he sits down in front of his breakfast plate, a fried egg on a square of dry toast, surrounded by four toast triangles. Hermione smiles knowingly. Harry turns away. Lavender bounces up. She goes. Ron looks even more miserable. He passes Ron a goblet. Ron looks at Hermione and Harry. Harry puts a glass vial in his pocket. Ron lifts the goblet to his lips and drinks. Hermione glares and Harry smiles. Ron smiles broadly. The two friends clasp hands over the table. The game is played in a snowstorm. Bound leather Quaffle zooms through the air, and is caught by a Slytherin Chaser. His green cape flapping behind him, he joins his teammates, who flank him as they charge for goal.",
    "610": "Over an adjacent street to the sound of gunshots, the taxi drops him and his luggage up the street with shops with graffiti'd shutters. He stares up at a rundown tenement building, then lowers his eyes to see a grimy kebab by the name of Kebab Palace. He stares straight ahead. Mrs. Kowalski leads Sydney into his grotty studio apartment. Inside, she slaps him. She leaves with her nose in the air. Tiles on the dance floor light up as he struts from one disinterested group of girls to another, waving his hands and moving his pelvis. He wiggles his backside and leaps about, the girls retreat from him wildly, and stop. He puffs out his cheek and walks off, the dance floor lights up again. On the street outside, Sydney passes a leggy blonde in a green. He glances over his shoulder to see her enter a bar with a red wood paneled exterior. Turning on his heel, he hastily follows her inside. The blonde heads for the bar. Sydney enters and adjusts his jacket before confidently sidling up beside her. Affecting a suave smile, he takes his seat facing her and leans on the bar. He gags on his drink. Sydney turns back to the leggy blonde. Sydney turns his back on the second woman, who's pretty with flaxen hair. The blonde leaves. Sydney takes out the newspaper clipping. He spills her drink. Her soggy notebook. The woman puts her phone away. She gathers her belongings. She glares at him. Her brow furrows. Bobbie, a buxom brunette in a zebra print dress, takes Alison's seat. Sydney nods, eyebrows raised. Then back at Sydney's sparse, undecorated apartment. Bobby staggers off into the bedroom like a schoolboy. Sydney takes a record and flings it over his head. He replaces it. Sydney thrashes out power cords on it, he flails wildly until the record suddenly stops. He turns at the stop. Bobbie's naked. Sydney points. Mrs. Kowalski slaps him. They turn to look at Bobbie, and their eyebrows shoot up in unison. Sidney wakes at 7:00 AM to the sound of his alarm clock. Grimacing he fumbles around and turns it off. Sunlight streams in through a bedside window. He yanks the cord of his venetian blind. It clatters down on top of him. He tumbles from the bed. He spits in the sink. He sips urine-colored water from a glass. He spits it out over the mirror. In a gray tee-shirt and boxer shorts he raises a blind in the living room. Half asleep under a blanket Bobbie adjusts his genitals. Strolls through Time Square in a tee-shirt, saw garish billboards compete with towering glass walled office blocks. a tower with glass walled office Reaches high in the sky.",
    "611": "He enters reception. He collides with an immovable turnstile, then staggers round. Attractive women dwarf him in an elevator. A petite brunette in a gray suit leads him into a spacious office. A be-suited man with shoulder length silver hair stands at a window staring out over the city. Clayton Harding turns to look at him. Sidney reaches into his shoulder bag and proffers a red tee-shirt. Clayton slings it out of an open window. A post-modern review depicting Clayton as a nude king. Sidney's smile fades as he meets with an indifferent stare. Clayton leaps through the offending issue. Doc suited Lawrence leads him into a private office. Sidney glances at his bright red tee-shirt and fidgets before pointing at a photograph on the wall. It's the woman whose drink he spilled in the bar. In an open-plan office Sidney crosses to Alison and perches on her desk. She works at a computer. A co-worker in a polka dot dress. She frowns. With a phone to his ear Sidney pulls over a sheet of printed photographic negatives. He adjusts his specs. She hangs up. The corners of his mouth down turned. He peers at the contact sheet through a magnifying eye-glass to see two portly middle aged gentlemen holding glasses of wine. He hits redial. He looks at the telephone receiver and frowns. Munching a hamburger Sidney enters the lobby through a revolving door. Blond in an A-line dress joins him. As the door start to close she reaches out towards a hastily approaching colleague. Quickly retracts her hand as the door slams shut. She narrows her eyes disapprovingly. It starts its descent. The doors open. She strides out in a huff to Alison, who is wearing sharp suit. Ignoring Sidney she opens a book and starts to read. Tight-lipped she stares down at her book. Alison lowers her eyes as a golden haired woman in her mid-40s wearing expensive sunglasses steps into the lift and turns her back on them. Sidney goes to swallow a mouthful of burger, but gags. A glob of chewed burger shoots out of his mouth and lands with a splat on the back of the woman's cream jacket. Sidney goes to wipe it off. Grabbing his wrist an incredulous Alison shakes her head. Sidney and Alison hurry out. He takes a bite of burger. Sidney rolls his eyes as he listens in. Night, Sidney gazes out through the window of a sleek black automobile as it glides through Manhattan. Alison and Lawrence seem indifferently thumb their mobiles phones. He looks out on the gaudy lights of Time Square. Sidney turns to his colleagues. They eyeball him then look back at their phones.",
    "613": "Flustered, he looks down at Elizabeth, then lifts his chin, flutters his eyelids and steps over her. Alison gives him the A-OK and he walks on. In a staff meeting, his coworkers look on stony-faced. He prods Alison's arm. Clayton rises from his seat at the head of the table and walks out. Alison raises a palm to Sidney. Clayton eats edamame beans and sushi at the desk in his office. He tries to ignore Sidney, who's tapping a notebook with a pen. He nods. Bill's eyes narrow. Bill's expression hardens. A sheepish-looking Sidney sits opposite an indignant Clayton. Sidney's hopeful smile wanes. Clayton stares at Sidney, who furrows his brow and points at the door. Clayton nods and Sidney leaves. Alison reads as models pick outfits from a rack. Sidney plunks himself down beside her and sighs. Alison stares at him. She scoffs. She stands up. She flounces off with her nose in the air. Sidney makes eye contact with Lawrence and waves. Sidney's nose is taped up like a pig's snout. Eleanor and Sophie approach. He tears the tape from his face and hides under his desk. He emerges from beneath the table with Sellotape stuck to his left ear. Sidney frowns and obediently toddles off. He fills a plastic container from a water cooler. He stares at Sophie, who's cradling Cuba. He screws up his face. Slighted, Eleanor gives him a piercing look and stomps off. His eyebrows twitch and he looks around. Lawrence and Sophie follow Eleanor from the office. Sidney cautiously opens the door of an office and peers in to see Cuba staring back at him. He tosses the little red ball, which bounces out through an open window. Cuba scampers after it. Sidney dives for the window and closes it. Sidney smiles, then looks up to see a large stone ornament. Sidney's eyes widen as the weighted, polished stone. Horrified, Sidney bites his fist. He calls an elevator. She points. They grapple for it. A white paw sticks out. Sophie, Eleanor, and Lawrence are in reception. Sidney runs off. Alison follows to find Sidney leaning out of a window. He turns minus the bag. She turns. She turns to look at Sidney, who shrugs, arms folded. The search party heads off, leaving a relieved Sidney slumped against a wall by the window. Cuba's nose sticks out of the leather handbag as it drifts up behind him on the window cleaner's rising platform. Sidney stands in the doorway of Clayton's office. He sips whiskey. He flings the blue shirts onto a desk and peers down his nose at them. He gestures with a raised hand. Smiling, Clayton strolls up to him. Sidney leaves, then steps back in.",
    "615": "He waves to her daughters. A bearded man with long gray hair, non-plussed. Sydney ponders. A beer bottle emerges over the railing of the bandstand. Drunk Sydney climbs up onto the railing behind the band and addresses the crowd with his arms out. The guests resume their conversations. Sydney limps up to Alison who sits alone in the half-light with a bottle of wine in her lap, gently rocking on a swing. He skulks off, then races back, gesticulating wildly. Alison strides off tearfully, leaving a dumbstruck Sydney staring after her. She quickly returns. She kicks it. He slumps down on the rope swing, then falls backwards onto the grass. Shimmering lights play on the rippling surface of the swimming pool. Sydney lies on his belly by the water's edge. Sophie's reflection appears like a mirage on the water and he rolls over to look up. She kneels down beside him. She lies down beside him on her belly. She rolls onto her back and moves closer to him. She stares up at the stars. Sydney bites his bottom lip. Smiling, she turns her head to look at Sydney, who lies on his side, gazing at her. Dappled by a pale shifting light, she looks back up at the stars. Sydney springs to his feet and races off through the party. The man hands Sydney a small Ziploc bag of white powder. Sydney runs off. Alison is bent over, drunkenly failing to unlock her car door. Holding Alison upright, Sydney gazes over at Sophie, kneeling by the pool. Sydney drives with Alison in the passenger seat. They drive on down a dark stretch of road. She presses her lips together, stifling tears. She vomits. Alison slung over Sydney's shoulder. Sydney sits in his apartment with his bespectacled father and Mrs. Kowalski. Wearing Sydney's jacket, Alison puts a song on in his bedroom. Mrs. Kowalski gives Alison a sideways look as she dances out to join them. The bag of white powder. Alison joins them on the sofa. She covers her mouth. Balding, brown-suited Richard stands as Mrs. Kowalski leads Alison to Sydney's bedroom. Sydney washes up as his father returns a framed portrait photo of a woman to a shelf. Richard looks blank. Richard sidles up behind him at the sink. Richard goes to put a hand on Sydney's shoulder, but can't bring himself to do it. He turns away. Richard puts a copy of his book down on the table. Sydney stares solemnly at his father, then reluctantly cracks a smile. Sydney opens the bedroom door. Leaning his head against the door frame, he peers into the dark room, where Alison lies sleeping. He smiles fondly. She stirs. Sydney's eyes dart left and right as he retreats from the room.",
    "617": "She looks at the floor. He raises his glass, then turns away, popping the fangs back in his mouth as he makes his way through the crowd. Alison has her back to him. A morose Sydney sits alone at the table, his goblet-like glass in front. Vincent and Elena sit in the back. Elena winds the window down. Vincent leans forward. Sydney steps back from the car window and knits his hands together by his chin. Drenched by the rain, he stares at them with window glides up. Elena smiles at the driver. The car pulls away, leaving a dispirited Sydney at the roadside, his hands clasped together, as if in prayer. His long cape hangs in a puddle on the pavement. He looks up at an electronic billboard from which Sophie stares at him. She blows a kiss. Breathing heavily, he hangs his head as the rain beats down on the dark street. In Clayton's office. Sydney smiles. Dressed in a sharp pin-striped suit and dark glasses, Sydney sits opposite Vincent in a sushi bar, hurriedly taking notes and smiling enthusiastically at Vincent's comments. Elena goes through Sydney's article, editing out the parts she doesn't like. She hands it back to him. He nods with a grateful smile as he looks it over. Sydney stands behind Elena and a dark-haired woman as they airbrush Vincent's publicity photographs on a computer. They digitally remove a pimple. Sydney takes a copy of Sharp's magazine from a news kiosk on a street corner. He flips through it to find his article. A broad smile spreads over Sidney's face. Sydney works at his computer in an office, his own. Over time, it fills up with various gift baskets. A female property agent shows Sydney around a spacious apartment. Someone hands Sydney a gift box at his desk, the new Omega Speedmaster watch. He takes off his old watch and flings it. Sydney's name is taped on a number of guest lists. Getting on like a house on fire, Sydney and Clayton share a joke in the lift. Wearing a white robe, Sydney sits in a steam room. A wide smile plays on his lips. Alison reads an article on Sydney in a magazine. She's sitting at a restaurant table. Lawrence joins her. On it is a white Russian cocktail. He reads over her shoulder. Lawrence removes his arm from round her shoulder, picks up his drink and takes a sip. As he walks away, Alison glances down at her novel and frowns. The exterior of Sydney's apartment building. Alison is inside the building. Wearing a stripey robe, Sydney opens his door. Alison nods. Alison throws her head back with a sigh as he fetches some documents.",
    "619": "The locker door is plastered with photos and cuttings. She pulls out a folder and some pages fall to the floor as a boy comes by. Juno grins at her friend talking to a fat bearded teacher. In class, Bleeker swallows some Tic Tacs as Juno appears by his side clutching her folders. Another boy stands on the other side of the work table. A second girl turns up. Amanda leaves Josh open mouth. Bleeker suppresses a smile. Later, Juno dials a number. She vigorously shakes the phone and something falls out. She frowns at the phone. Juno throws up in a decorative urn. Juno's little sister sprinkles her food. Liberty Bell smiles slowly. Juno plods away past Su-Chin. Juno stops in her tracks. She shrugs and walks on towards the door of the Women Now Center. A punk girl sits in reception playing on her game console. Juno wanders into the lobby and steps up to the counter. Juno nods obediently. Juno takes the questionnaire clipboard to a padded leather bench and sits down. As she starts to fill in the form, she becomes aware of a black woman seated nearby crumbing her fingers against her clipboard. A woman painting her nails, another scratching her arm, another using a nail file add to the crescendo of sound. Juno drops her pen. Su-Chin brightens. They sit on a park bench scouring the paper. Leah hands pipe smoking Juno an ad. Bleeker is lying on his bed, looking at the photo of Juno in his yearbook. His other hand is clasped around a piece of cloth. Bleeker's solidly built double-chinned mother closes the door of his bedroom. He goes back to gazing at Juno's picture and brings his class pen from behind his head. Scrunched in his fingers, he's holding the knickers she wore and discarded on the day they had sex. At Juno's house, Leah watches apprehensively as Juno paces in front of her dad and her step mom. Mac and Bren brace themselves. Juno looks them both in the eye. Leah pulls a face. Juno meets her dad's bewildered gaze, then lets her head drop for a second before speaking. Mac shakes his head as she turns on her heels and hightails upstairs with Leah behind her. He runs his hands over his face. A slim young woman arranges some white hydrangeas in a glass vase. White cuffed hands straightens a glass photo frame. She places some aromatic sticks into a bottle. Mac with Juno beside him drives his blue Previa through the gates of the affluent looking Glacial Valley estate. With a ring on the fourth finger of her left hand, fans out the display of coffee table magazines, straightens two monogram tan towels, and wipes a banister rail as Mac drives past a number of substantial houses set back from the road.",
    "620": "He slows down in front of one house with a triple garage and box tree on the front lawn and pulls up onto the driveway. As the woman carefully adjusts the buttons on her pristine white cuffs, Mac and Juno wearing everyday casual clothes stroll up to the double-fronted door flanked by two slim furs. Mac wipes his feet on the doormat. The woman with neatly combed long dark hair opens the door with a bright smile. Juno's slaps Gerta's profit hand. Vanessa purses her lips. Vanessa looks penetratingly at Juno. On the staircase, Juno in her loose checked shirt over jeans passes a lineup of post photos of Mark and Vanessa in white. She wonders into Vanessa's en suite bathroom and contemplates herself in the large mirror above the basin, smoothing the front of her hair. There are several expensive looking bottles and jars grouped around the basin, next to a white orchid in a pot. Opening one jar, she scoops out a finger full of cream and damps it on her face. Then does a bodybuilder type snarl and pose. Picking up a bottle of perfume, she sniffs it and sprays her wrist, rubbing it against the other wrist. As she comes out of the bathroom, she collides with Mark. Her eye lights on the guitar. Mac points to some apparatus. Vanessa smiles proudly. Mac's attempted conversation is met with a baffled look. Then, he and both women look up towards the sound drifting down from the floor above. With a brittle smile, tall slim Vanessa hurries upstairs to find Mark and Juno duetting on guitars. Mac is looking at some forms. Mark closes the front door with a wry smile. Vanessa presses her hands together as if in prayer and lets him fold her in his arms. Vijay speeds up leaving Bleeker alone on the running track. Two boys pass him as he slows to a walk. At school, a grey head starkly built woman in a mauve cardigan sits behind the desk looking disapprovingly at Juno bulging. The woman grudgingly signs a pink form and hands it to Juno. Juno smiles sweetly and comes out into the corridor. A technician spreads gel across Juno's distended belly with an ultrasound scan head. On a monitor next to her, Juno watches moving patches of light and dark take on a recognizable shape. Leah and Bren sigh with delight. Bren's lips tighten. With a look that could kill, the ultrasound technician leaves the room. In her room, with its walls covered in drawings, Juno lies on her bed, her legs propped up on cushions, gazing at the ultrasound print. She blinks thoughtfully and moments later is driving Mac's blue Previa out to Glacial Valley estate past its immaculate houses and lawns blanketed in snow.",
    "624": "A set of swings and a climbing frame stand in a rural backyard, along with a picnic table and a brick barbecue. An upstairs window looks out over the scene. Inside a framed photo on a bedside table shows a smiling family. Mum, dad, and a young boy and girl. The dad wears a clerical collar. Suddenly, the same man leans up on his elbows in bed. His eyes darting feverishly around the simply furnished room. He relaxes and sits up. The man, Graham Hess, comes out of his bedroom wearing a black t-shirt and pajama bottoms. He walks along the landing in his bare feet and comes to a closed door with some hand drawn children's pictures stuck to it. Graham pauses for a moment to listen at the door. Then, returns to his bedroom, picking up some discarded socks on the way. He's in his mid-40s with short dark hair and a rugged handsome face. Graham crosses the bathroom and stares out of the door, his toothbrush in his mouth. He strides across the landing, opens the door to the children's room and glances around. A younger man in a similar rural style bedroom, suddenly, jolts and tumbles out of bed. He jumps to his feet and strains to listen. Graham rushes out of his wooden farmhouse and heads towards a whitewashed barn, while the younger man runs down a flight of steps from the other floor. Graham and the young man, Merrill, charge through a field of tall green maize. They stop when they reach a gap. And look along a clear pathway, which cuts through the crop. A dark haired girl of about six-years-old stands a little further down the path. The two men run over to her, and Graham grabs her by the arms. Merrill picks up Bo and Graham dashes on through the maize. He reaches a fair haired boy of about 10, who stares glassily across the field. Graham turns Morgan's head to face him. Morgan puts his hand around his father's jaw, and turns his head to face in the direction he had been staring. Graham stands and slowly walks through the maize, followed by Merrill, who's still carrying Bo in his arms. Graham stops and glances around anxiously. He swallows hard and tentatively steps forward onto a sea of flattened maize stalks. Graham stares in wonder as he, Merrill, Morgan and Bo come to the perimeter of a vast circular expanse of flattened maize. Two large Alsatians pace around uneasily in the center. An aerial view shows Graham and his family standing in the circle, which is about 100 yards in diameter. Another crop circle lies beside it. It's the same size, but has a small semi-circle of maize still standing within it.",
    "626": "Holding the knife at belly level, he twists the long wide blade until he's looking at his own reflection in the polished steel. Glancing up, he reaches forward and positions the knife at a downward sloping angle at the base of the door. Turning the knife in different directions, cans, bottles, and boxes of food are reflected in the blade. Graham withdraws the knife and puts it down on the floor beside him. Then frustrating himself on his belly, he makes to look under the door again. Having second thoughts, he grabs the knife and kneels up. Setting the knife back down on the worktop. He rises to his feet and head bowed strides determinedly out into the hallway. Stopping in his tracks, Graham turns and marches back in, seizing the knife. He lies on his stomach by the pantry door. A clawed hand shoots out from under the door. Startled, Graham bangs his head and drops the knife. Retrieving the knife, Graham slices off the creature's fingers. Startled, the flock of birds springs from the maize fields, scattering, and flying away. Later, Graham returns to the farm house. Locking the door behind him, he hurriedly checks the handle, then, walks off past the open living room door. He stops dead and stares, seeing Bo, Morgan, and now Merrill on the sofa wearing silver foil cone hats. Without flinching, Graham turns stiffly and goes to sit on the stairs. Merrill sits still with his hands on his knees. Graham links his hands together. Merrill turns to Morgan. Graham makes a pained frown. Putting one hand on the post at the bottom of the stairs, Graham pulls himself wearily up and plods into the living room, moving up to the sofa. Bo holds up one arm. Graham does the same. Morgan and Merrill raise their arms. Graham eyes them uncertainly. All three. Merrill and Bo lower their arms, Morgan settles himself back down on the sofa. Graham hesitates a moment then steps forward, and sits beside his son on the end of the couch. Morgan peers up at his father. Merrill stares blankly ahead. He sighs. Now, in broad daylight, Merrill leaves his converted barn holding a large white cotton sack. A cigarette in one hand, he jogs down the grey-painted wooden stairs on the side of the building then trudges across the lawn towards the farmhouse. As he takes a drag on the cigarette, his attention is drawn to the field of maize. Merrill throws the cigarette butt to the ground, then, slows to a gradual stop. Dumping the cotton sack, he reaches down, picks up a stone, and launches it into the field of maize. He stands immobile, watching the crop with anxious expectation.",
    "627": "Behind him, shrubs growing outside the farmhouse are buffeted by the growing wind. Merrill eyes the crops suspiciously, then, retreats. He picks up the cotton sack, jogs up the steps to the farmhouse veranda and hits indoors. Morgan and Bo are glued to the TV screen in the closet. Graham and Merrill arrive. They stand and watch. Graham looks uneasy. Merrill is deep in thought. The presenter shifts fearfully. Unflinching, Graham stares directly at the television screen. Standing rooted to the floor, Graham continues to scrutinize the images on the TV. His features sagging mournfully as he reflects on the presenter's words. He wanders off, leaving Merrill alone with Morgan and Bo. The two children are mesmerized by the screen. Merrill kneels down on the floor beside them. Looking up at Merrill. Pale with worry, Morgan turns back to the TV. Graham is now in the room. He moves to a window, which is being partially boarded up on the inside and peers out. He then takes a plank of old wood and secures it over the window, blocking out the light completely. Outside, the silver pipes of a wind chime knock against each other. Then, more chimes are disturbed by the strengthening breeze. Graham sits indoors in dim lights, staring and failing me ahead. Merrill saunters into the room and stops next to Morgan and Bo, who are standing against a wall. Graham nods. Graham smiles. Graham turns to look at his brother. Graham beams. His lips spread into a smile. Later, in the dimly lit kitchen, pans and bowls, one full of empty eggshells, are stacked up into two sinks. On a worktop lies a sharp knife along with a skinned onion, some potato peel on top of tomato. Graham, Merrill, and the two children sit silently at the dinner table in the next room. Shifting awkwardly in his chair, Graham casts a fleeting glance at the others. Graham's taken aback. Graham's lips tremble slightly. Morgan's eyes are swollen. He reaches over and stabs his fork into a piece of molten toast, then, sits back down. Merrill watches in disbelief as Graham tucks into his mound of food. Bo sitting next to him in tears. Upset, Graham winces as he eats. Observing him, Morgan gets up from his chair and goes to his dad who is now throwing down his fork and is sobbing uncontrollably. Morgan leans into his father who hugs him tightly, then, pulls Bo to his other side. Merrill is staring self-consciously at his plate when Graham's hand reaches out, and tucks him in the family embrace. Graham's body rocks as he cries. At the other end of the table, the red lines on the baby monitor begin to flash.",
    "628": "Graham and his family look up and stare at. Graham walks slowly across the polished wooden floor into the front hallway. Reaching the door to the cupboard under the stairs, he pulls it open. He looks at the TV set inside. It's displaying a test card. He turns to look back at the others and swallows. Later, Merrill is upstairs, hammering boards the door to the children's bedroom. Across the landing in his room, Graham cautiously approaches the window and looks out over the maize field. His eyes widening and becoming fixed in a fearful stare, he backs towards the bedroom door. Merrill looks over at him. Eyes still on the window, Graham sidles out of the room and closes the door. Graham lifts up a plank and holds it across the door. Merrill taking the other end. Together, the two men hammered nails through the plank into the door frame. Bo with Morgan standing at the top of the stairs behind them, watching. Turning to get another nail, Graham stops and stares at Bo before helping Merrill with another plank. Bo remains motionless, clinging to her brother. Bo walks over. He crouches down. She shakes her head. Bo grins at him. He strokes her cheek. Graham pulls her towards him. He picks his daughter up. Merrill slaps another plank across the bedroom door. Bo in his arms, Morgan go downstairs into the front hallway. Graham and Merrill put the children down. They stop and listen. They all stare in the direction of the barking beyond the wooden mantle piece which stands at the far end of the room. Two China dogs sitting on it, one on each side, illuminated by the dim glow of two wall lamps above them. Graham's eyes dart nervously around. His fingers tightening on Bo's shoulders in front of him. He and Merrill exchange anxious glances. They looked towards a boarded up window to the right of the mantle piece, their gaze passes across the fireplace as they turned to follow the noises. Shadows flit across the slit of moonlight between two planks across the window on the left of the mantle piece. Slowly, the family turns to watch the figures block out the soft light, diffusing through the gaps between the boards on another window at the front of the house. They swing around and stare petrified down the hallway and into the kitchen towards the backdoor. They turn quickly back around to look at the front door, one plank nailed across the frame halfway up. The doorknob turns. Morgan starts to back away. Graham looks around and puts a comforting hand on Morgan's shoulder before kneeling down in front of the frightened boy. Graham smiles lovingly as a tear falls from Morgan's eyes.",
    "629": "Merrill stares wearily up the staircase, climbing the first two steps. He gazes in horror at the unsecured hatch door in the attic. Merrill and Graham pulled the children down the hallway into the kitchen. Morgan's terrified eyes focused on the gap at the bottom of the front door as green gray fingers appear underneath it. Graham hurries down some stairs into the gloomy basement and slams the door shut. Graham turns suddenly and presses his ear against the door. His hands pushing against the door, its olive green paint peeling. Graham looks down at the doorknob. He grabs it as it starts to turn and holds it tight with both hands, resting his head on the door. Merrill spots a pickaxe. As he yanks it off a high shelf, he smashes the light bulb, plunging the basement into darkness. Morgan turns on a torch and stares down into its bright beam before looking around and pointing it at the door. Graham and Merrill pushing hard against it, the pickaxe now firmly waged under the doorknob. Graham turns to put his back against the door. He shields his eyes from the bright torch beam. Morgan slowly directs the torch beam around the basement, and starts to walk past a cluttered work bench. The light falls on Bo, crouched on the floor. She waves lamely at Morgan. Merrill finds another flashlight and directs its beam around the walls of the basement, illuminating old wooden shelves, supporting neatly-arranged pickling jars, bowls, ski boots, roller skates, and disordered clatter. He spots a dusty old radio on one shelf and tuns the dial on the front. They went around to face the door. Graham pushes his hand against the door lit by Morgan's torch. He then turns to face the others. The pickaxe holds in place as the doors hit. Graham stares thoughtfully at the door. Morgan sets the white-headed silver torch on the ground and rolls it across to his father. Merrill walks over to Graham. Graham and Merrill move slowly in different directions, working their way around the rough stone walls. A dry and faded flowery hangs on a hook. A wire-framed basket hangs on another peg. They come towards each other again. Their torch beams picking up the call shoot with roll turning grill across it and Morgan standing in front of it. Merrill and Graham stand and stare at him, stunned. A clawed hand pokes through the grill and grabs Morgan's throat. Graham drops his torch as he rushes to rescue his son. As he runs away from the call shoot, he kicks the torch which rolls around to pick out Bo's legs, poking out from beneath her silky blue dress as she presses herself up against the wall.",
    "630": "She walks over to the torch, picks it up, and shines it at Merrill, who's stacking crates and live sacks of dog food in front of the chute. He slides wearily down his barricade to the ground. Spotting a can of dog food on the floor, he picks it up and rising slightly, reaches up beside him to slap it on top of the pile of sacks. Sitting back down on the floor, he looks across at Bo, and then, picks up his torch, using it to search the basement for the others. The beam illuminates his brother, sitting on the floor, leaning against a pillar. Morgan, sitting between Graham's legs, his head pushed back into his father's chest. Merrill's eyes widened in alarm. Graham has one hand on Morgan's chest, the other gripping his son's shoulder. Bo stares at them wide-eyed. Graham rests his head against Morgan's. Bo goes to sit on Merrill's lap, tears welling in her eyes. Morgan holds the knees of his father's jeans tightly as he struggles with his breathing. Graham lifts his head slightly and stares angrily into the distance. His lips quiver. Merrill wheels Morgan on, mouthing silent words of earnest prayer. Morgan relaxes his grip on his father's jeans. Morgan lies back, his breathing returning to normal. Merrill stares across at them, blinking rapidly. He swallows. He turns his off. Bo turn hers off. In Graham's mind, he reaches the scene of the accident. Caroline talks to him. He stares at the ground. His lips trembling. Caroline nods. She smiles bleakly. Graham walks slowly past a police car and a huddle of policemen standing over Ray who's sitting on the ground head bowed. A little way beyond is Ray's Ford pickup truck smashed into the tree, stretched into any of the front and a couple of paramedics standing by. They turned to look at Graham as he approaches. Back in the basement, the main light is on. Graham looks up. Merrill walks over to the radio. Graham stares blearily down at the floor. Graham looks up at Merrill in shock. Graham gets to his feet and takes a step towards his brother. Graham looks reflectively down at the ground. Merrill regards him accusingly. Graham frowns and shakes his head. Merrill steps towards him. Graham nods numbly, his mouth agape. They turn to look at Morgan asleep on the floor, his head resting on folded blankets. Graham glances at the door. Suddenly, thinking of something, Graham walks over to Morgan, and crouching down, lifts up the back of the boy's beige and brown check shirt. Graham glances up in relieved surprise. And pulls the baby monitor out of the back pocket of Morgan's jeans.",
    "632": "He stares into her eyes and nods. Graham's eyes fill with tears as he reaches out to take her hand in his. Graham stares at her, puzzled, through his wet eyes. Her head lowers. Graham remembers his conversation with Merrill. His eyes glazed with tears, Graham stares at the alien as it rocks back and forth, leaning over its captive hanging limply over its arm. Graham turns slowly from the creature to face Merrill, spotting the baseball bat in its rack mounted on the wall by his brother. He turns back around to stare with stern determination at the alien. Merrill remains motionless. Merrill turns his gaze from the creature to Graham. And then looks behind him to the bat. The alien watches him. Its small eyes glowing green in their sunken sockets. Merrill takes the bat down. The alien lowers its hand over Morgan's face. A gray gash shooting from the spike and into Morgan's nose. The alien turns. Merrill launches himself at the creature, striking it in the back. The alien drops Morgan. And turns back to face his assailant. Graham rushes over to pick up Morgan and the dropped syringe. Merrill strikes the creature in its abdomen. It falls into a side table, knocking over a glass of water. As the water spills onto its shoulder, an angry red wound erupts in its green gray skin. Merrill and Graham stare around the room at the collection of discarded glasses of water. Graham turns to Bo in astonishment. And then hurries outside with Morgan in his arms. Bo following him. On the veranda, Bo looks back into the living room through a broken window as Graham heads out onto the lawn. Merrill swings the bat at glasses on the coffee table. The alien recoils as its skin is splashed with liquid. Crouched on the lawn, Graham, holding his son across his thighs, adjusts the syringe. And then, thrusts it into Morgan's leg. Merrill prepares for another strike. He slams the bat into the alien. The creature topples over, landing on his back and knocking against a small sideboard. Glasses on the sideboard tip over. Water cascading down onto the crib. The broken head of the bat lies on the floor, shards of glass around it. The alien takes deep, difficult breaths. The alien's chest sinks and fails to rise. Merrill hurries out into the garden and crouches down by Graham and Morgan. Graham, his eyes closed, cradles his limp son. Merrill presses Morgan's neck and recoils. Merrill turns away. Bo's face creases as she begins to sob. Graham opens his moistened eyes. His face shudders. Merrill swings round. Bo looks on in awe. Graham turns. Hardly daring to look at his son as Morgan lifts his head.",
    "633": "A path leads from the side of the circle, splitting into two prongs. A third crop circle has two straight lines at either side, and a circle of maize remaining in the center, with another path leading off from its side. It splits into three larger prongs, the central one of which points towards a smaller circle. Graham is on the phone as he looks out of his window at the yard. He bows his head. Graham steps into the kitchen. One of the dogs lies on the floor near a puddle of liquid. Morgan and Bo lead the Alsatian into the backyard. Graham crosses the kitchen and pulls some paper towels off a roll. He dabs at the urine, saturating the towels. Then, stands and walks back across the kitchen. A dark haired woman in a police uniform leans casually in a doorway leading to the front hall. Carolyn sighs wearily and gazes at Graham. In the yard, Morgan's at the smoking barbecue. He sticks a fork in a chicken wing and turns it over. One of the Alsatians watches Morgan from the veranda. The other one, Houdini, lies slumped in the yard with Bo kneeling in front of him. Morgan walks across to Bo as she drinks from a large glass of water. Morgan kneels beside his sister, and drinks from the tall glass. He gives her the glass. Bo carefully pours the water into a metal dog bowl, and slides it across the grass to Houdini. The Alsatian suddenly jerks his head up towards Bo. Bo jumps back in shock. And Morgan frowns. Bo stands. Houdini stands up and Bo freezes. The stalks all lie in the same direction. Graham shakes his head. She looks across the field. Graham stares thoughtfully into space. He rises and slowly walks towards the edge of the circle. Caroline stands and watches him with a slightly puzzled expression. Graham gazes across the field. Graham and Caroline emerge through the tall green crop and look around anxiously. Graham spots something over to his left and strides briskly towards it with a concerned expression. Caroline follows him. And they break into a jog. Houdini lies motionless on the ground near the climbing frame, with Morgan kneeling beside him. The barbecue fork sticks out of Houdini's throat. And Morgan holds an asthma inhaler as he stares down at the dog. Morgan looks up at his father through puffy red eyes. Bo sits up on a platform on the climbing frame, with her knees drawn tightly up to her chin. She wears blue sneakers and jeans under her pale flowery dress. Morgan looks back down and takes a puff of his inhaler. Graham stares at his son and crouches down beside Houdini.",
    "634": "Morgan takes Graham's hand and steps over Houdini. They gaze down at the dead dog. Graham puts his hand on Morgan's shoulder. Morgan brushes it away and trudges off solemnly. Graham steps up to the climbing frame and looks searchingly at Bo. She remains in a tight ball, staring down at the ground. Graham gently lifts her off the platform and holds her against his shoulder. He carries Bo back to the farmhouse as Merrill emerges, carrying a bowl and a bag of feed. Graham walks past him. Graham climbs onto the veranda and walks through the front door of the house. Merrill looks over to the climbing frame with a confused expression. He's in his early 30s with short dark hair and a boyish face. Merrill puts down the bag of feed and unties Isabel, the other Alsatian, from the veranda steps. He leads her across the yard as Caroline pulls the barbecue fork from Houdini's throat. A wire wind chime in the shape of a beaming sun hangs on the veranda and swings mournfully in the soft breeze. That night the farmhouse stands in darkness beneath a black sky. Graham lies on his side in bed. His eyes suddenly open. He stares ahead. Bo gazes at him. Graham pads across the landing to the children's bedroom, holding Bo by the hand. They come to the open bedroom door and step into the darkened room, where Morgan lies half off his bed in an uncomfortable looking heap. Bo shuffles off to her bed as Graham gently lifts Morgan up and lies him on his back. Graham walks across the bedroom and sits beside Bo on her bed. He gazes at her and looks her up and down. Bo looks at him through wide bright eyes. A sadness falls across Graham's face. Graham looks at his daughter, then, glances over at the bedroom window. A shadowing figure stands by a chimney pot on the barn roof. Graham jumps to his feet. Downstairs in the lounge, Merrill's asleep in an armchair. Graham touches his shoulder and Merrill wakes. He looks up at his brother in confusion. Graham and Merrill are by the front door. Merrill opens the door. An outside light comes on. They rush out and split up. Merrill comes to the back of the house as a dust bin's tipped over up ahead. Graham runs along the side of the house. The brothers meet up again at the front of the house. They stop and look around breathlessly. A sound on the roof of the house attracts their attention. Merrill keeps his gaze fixed firmly on the farmhouse roof as he paces backwards down the gloomy yard, and tries to get a better view.",
    "636": "Graham's silver station wagon drives along the freeway and passes a large modern church. The station wagon parks up beside some other vehicles outside a parade of shops and the family get out. Merrill feeds the parking meter. And Morgan holds his hand out to Graham. Graham hands Morgan some cash. Morgan and Bo head off down the sidewalk together. Graham watches them as Morgan holds out his hand and Bo takes it. Graham turns and calls to Merrill, who strolls off in the other direction. Morgan's in a bookshop watching the news coverage with the middle aged proprietors. A radio's on in a pharmacy as Graham waits at the counter. The young shop assistant comes to the counter with a paper prescription bag. She leans pensively on the counter. Tracy's face crumples. Graham looks awkward. Merrill's in an army recruitment center looking at the posters. A gray haired man in a sergeant's uniform sits at a desk with a poster of Uncle Sam behind him. Merrill turns to the sergeant. Cunningham stares up at Merrill. Merrill gazes apprehensively down at Cunningham, then laughs. He gives Merrill a pamphlet. Merrill stares at Cunningham. Merrill nods. A scruffy young man's filling out a form. Lionel smirks. He has stubble on his chin and wears a t-shirt and sleeveless biker jacket. Merrill folds up the pamphlet and puts it in his pocket. Merrill walks solemnly towards the door. He stops just behind Lionel and jerks as though about to hit him. Lionel flinches. And Merrill leaves. In the bookshop, Bo sits at a table and sips a glass of water. A cola commercial comes on TV. Morgan holds the book out to the lady. In the pharmacy. Tracy thinks. Merrill, Morgan, and Bo are already eating in a pizza restaurant when Graham comes in and sits at their table. The other three nod. Graham sighs and nods back. Then, glances out of the restaurant doorway. His expression hardens when he sees a young dark-haired man of Asian descent strolling down the sidewalk, and opening the back door of a brown Chevrolet four by four. Morgan follows his father's gaze and looks out of the doorway at the man. Merrill also gazes out at the young man. Graham and his family stare fixedly out at the young man, who shuts his car door and glances over at the restaurant. He sees the family gazing back at him. And his mouth opens in surprise. Graham takes a deep breath. And the young man looks unsettled as he gets into his driver's seat, and fires up the engine. The four by four swings out of its parking bay, and accelerates off down the road. Graham turns back to the table and takes a bite of pizza, while Merrill, Morgan, and Bo continue looking out at the street.",
    "639": "Morgan fetches a video. Graham stares wide-eyed at the screen. Now seated, Morgan uses his inhaler. He's beside Merrill. Bo's at the other end of the sofa beside her dad. All four of them are hypnotized by the TV on which sit two glasses of water. Later, with the lights out, Graham and Merrill are still transfixed. The children sleeping. He stares ahead. He meets Merrill's gaze. Merrill looks away. Merrill's smile fades. And Graham looks somber. Uneasy, Merrill ponders this. Then, recalls something. And his face brightens a little. He grins. Graham watches the TV. Merrill looks at Graham, then, nods. Graham shoots a knowing glance at his brother, who looking forlorn, returns his gaze to the TV. Graham stares vacantly. His eyes meet with Merrill's. Merrill shakes his head. With conviction in his eyes, he stares piercingly at Merrill. He looks almost angry. His features taut and his eyes glistening, Graham turns to face the TV. Merrill looks down thoughtfully. Then he too faces the TV. And they watch together. Their expressions blank as if in a trance. Now, a fresh-faced Graham, dressed in black, and wearing a white dog collar, drives slowly down a country road at night. Ahead, the lights of emergency vehicles flash. And Caroline stands in the road, waving her arms above her head. His face long, Graham pulls to a stop and climbs out. Caroline walks up to meet him. Graham wakes up on the sofa. And his glazed eyes scan the room. Light floods through the windows into the comfortably furnished room. Graham heaves himself into a sitting position. And stays there for a while without moving. He then spots a black cable snaking across the polished dark wood floor. Hoisting himself slowly to his feet, he follows the cable across the room and into the hallway. The lead runs into a closet under the stairs. And Graham opens the door to find a bleary eyed Merrill sitting perfectly still, staring fixedly at the TV. He looks up, a little surprised. Uncomfortable, Graham goes. The doors shut. Later, Graham, wearing a blue dressing gown, pads out of the bathroom, drying his ear with a towel. Frowning, he goes to a window and looks down into the empty garden, with its swings, climbing frame and picnic bench. Hearing the voice, Graham raises his eyebrows. Then, walks along the landing and into the children's room. Morgan and Bo are sitting on a bed, wearing pointy cone shaped hats made of silver foil. They look up. Morgan's holding open a book. Bo points to her hat. Graham enters and sits down between his children on the bed. He peers down at Morgan's book. Morgan closes the book.",
    "64": "It stops him cold. Swearing and choking, he pulls himself out of the rushing water by means of the fence itself. Drenched, battered, he slowly climbs back over the fence and makes his way toward his car. He fishes for his car keys, looks down. One shoe is missing. He starts to get into his car but Mulvihill and a smaller man stop him. Mulvihill pulling his coat down and pinning his arms, holding him tightly. The smaller man thrusts a switchblade knife about an inch and a half up Gittes' left nostril. Frozen, the knife in his nostril, the street lamp overhead gleaming on the silvery blade. With a quick flick the smaller man pulls back on the blade, laying Gittes' left nostril open about an inch further. Gittes screams. Blood gushes down onto his shirt and coat. Gittes bends over, instinctively trying to keep the blood from getting on his clothes. Mulvihill and the smaller man stare at him. Gittes is now groveling on his hands and knees. Gittes on the ground can see only his tormentor's two-tone brown and white wing-tipped shoes, lightly freckled with his blood. Comes up and lightly shoves Gittes into the ground. The sound of footsteps retreating, Gittes gasping. Sits behind his desk, back to camera, not moving. Duffy sits staring at nothing, Walsh moves uneasily around the room. Gittes turns slowly to Walsh. He lightly taps his nose. Gittes looks irritated. Gittes picks up the phone. Walsh promptly starts to tell Duffy the Admiral Byrd story. Walsh has finished off the punch line and both men are laughing raucously. Gittes drops the mail he's been loafing through and puts his hand over the receiver. Gittes looks to his two men. Gittes is seated, flips through the paper until he finds the obituary column, scans it, looks up, abruptly tears the column from the paper and puts it in his pocket. Evelyn Mulwray is standing at the table as he does so. He rises, allows her to sit. She's wearing dove gray gabardine, subdued, tailored. The waiter's appeared. Evelyn is looking at Gittes' nose. Evelyn looks down and smoothes her gloves. When she looks back up she stares expectantly at Gittes. Gittes pulls out a torn envelope. Gittes' fingers the envelope. He coughs. Gittes smiles. Gittes looks significantly to Evelyn. Evelyn is clearly angry but she is controlling it. This subdues Gittes a little. Evelyn is still a little heated. Evelyn for the first time appears a little embarrassed. Evelyn looks squarely at him. Gittes nods. He's been fingering the envelope. Evelyn turns into Gittes. Gittes leans on the open door of his car and in to Evelyn. He talks quietly but spits it out.",
    "642": "Jamal and Latika stare at each other. The guard presses the intercom. The guard approaches to open the gates. Latika quickly moves inside the house. Jamal enters an expensively furnished marble living room. He sees Latika behind the glass partition separating the room from a kitchen and approaches. She removes her dark glasses and stands expectantly as he steps from behind the partition. They both stand stock still. She takes a sharp intake of breath. She smiles as he moves towards her then they embrace each other tightly. Suddenly, she looks scared and backs away. He looks at her shocked. A silver Mercedes pulls up to the house. As Javed steps into the living room, Latika puts an apron over Jamal's neck. Javed walks straight into the kitchen and levels his malevolent gaze at Latika. He points to the game show on TV. He walks into the living room and sits down in front of a widescreen TV. He switches on the cricket game. Latika nervously prepares a sandwich for Javed. Jamal spreads a concoction of preservatives onto a slice of bread as Latika dumps a limp piece of lettuce on the plate. Jamal and Latika exchange nervous glances. He grabs her hand. She breaks his hold, lifts the plate, and takes it to Javed. She passes in front of the TV. and Javed shoos her out of the way back to the kitchen. Javed watches the game. He throws his drink. Jamal looks pleadingly at Latika. Javed, still transfixed by the cricket game, takes a bite of his sandwich. He looks disgusted and spits it out onto the plate. He walks into the kitchen. He glares at Jamal. He goes back to the cricket, swearing under his breath. Latika pushes Jamal toward the door. She slowly shakes her head. She pushes him out of the door. He remains in the courtyard looking back at her. Jamal takes a deep breath and raises his eyes upwards. The cricket match replays. He tenses his jaw muscles then hands back the check to the host. Jamal looks out of a train window as it races through the city. The train pulls into a large station. He jumps off. Hundreds of passengers alight from the train and throng on the platforms. An enormous station clock shows five minutes to five. Now the clock shows five-fifteen. As Jamal moves along the walkway looking down on the platform, he scans the busy platforms and looks at the overhead clock. He rests his head on his hands in despair then he squats down. Latika appears on the platform. She's looking around her. Jamal looks up and catches sight of her. He stands up immediately. She looks very anxious.",
    "646": "Jamal's mother screams at the boys. The attackers bludgeon defenseless men and women. Jamal watches as his mother is clubbed in the face. She falls back into the water. The boys help each other out of the pool and run. Jamal looks back for his mother but Salim urges him onward. A man falls and is stamped on by a mob. Salim and Jamal run past another man throwing a Molotov cocktail at a door. Jamal and Salim flee down an alley and come face to face with a young boy dressed as the Hindu god Rama. He is covered in blue paint with his hair bound up on his head. They both run. The boys run past the girl, Latika, hiding in an alley. A man sets another man on fire. The boys run towards a police station. Latika falls behind. The policemen are playing cards. A man runs out into the street. His clothes in flames. The policemen do nothing. The boys run again, beckoning to Latika to follow. Jamal's mother lies face down in the pool. Present day, back in the police station. Jamal remembers seeing the young boy dressed as the god Rama. The boys are frozen to the spot momentarily and stare at the bow and arrow in the boy's hand. Jamal on the show. Jamal is lost in thought. Five-year-old Jamal and Salim stand on high ground looking down on their slum burning amidst the riots. Latika stands some distance away from the boys. Latika stands in the street drenched in the torrential rain as Jamal and Salim sit in a shelter. Salim rolls onto his side. Jamal looks out at Latika in the rain for a moment then lies down. Jamal and Salim's mother screams as flames explode. Jamal wakes up. Salim lies with his back to Jamal, but he's wide awake. Jamal looks at Latika still out in the rainy street. She squats down tracing letters in the puddles. Jamal calls out to her. She stands up. She runs over to the shelter. She squats down next to Jamal. Latika shakes her head. Salim's eyes are still wide open. Latika lies down next to Jamal. The three children lie on the floor out of the rain shivering in the cold. Present day, Jamal sits on the studio stage opposite the host. People scavenge on mountains of rotting rubbish as lauries offload more refuse sacks. Jamal in the studio looking pensive. On the rubbish tip, Latika picks through scraps with a stick. She looks up when a minibus arrives. She turns and shouts. Two men emerge from the minibus and approach a makeshift tent. Two pairs of feet they count. Jamal and Salim lie dosing in the tent amidst the rubbish.",
    "647": "The smaller man, Maman, kneels at the entrance and strokes Salim's foot. He wakes up. He hands him a Coke. Jamal wakes and is also given a Coke. Maman pats him on the back, smiling all the way. The boys grin and gulp down the drinks. The minibus is driving through lush countryside. The bus is full of scruffy street kids gazing out of the windows. The bus arrives at a large dilapidated residence where numerous children of all ages run around playing in the yard. Some children move around on crutches. Others play on swings. Salim smiles and the children on the bus jump around excitedly. Maman watches as the children are fed a hot meal. Jamal catches Maman staring at the new arrivals. Evening, Maman has lined up the new children before him. Maman closes his eyes and listens to Arvind. He pats him on the head. Arvind moves back in line. Salim steps out to sing. Maman screws up his face and buries his head in his hands. He strikes Latika. He punches Punnoose's thighs as Maman laughs. Everyone laughs. Next day, Salim sits with Punnoose in the bus, intently watching a group of kids on a Mumbai street. Salim approaches the gang of children. Salim claps his hands. Jamal stops playing and watches his brother. Salim slaps the giggling child. He stalks around malevolently. The child refuses so Salim snatches the baby from her. He pretends to drop the baby in front of Latika. The gang of children run out into the busy street. Some limp with crutches, others have missing hands. The children shake containers at people begging for money or food. Latika wears an eye patch and begs at a stationary car window. Midnight at Maman's compound. Jamal points at some dried chillies. Latika wearing rubber gloves picks up a fist full of chillies. She crushes them in her palms. She sneaks into the dormitory where all the children are sleeping on the floor. She finds Salim sleeping naked under a thin sheet and carefully stuffs the chilies over his groin. Punnoose dozes, oblivious. Latika sneaks off back to her side of the dormitory. Salim suddenly jerks awake. He dashes to the tap. Salim douses his groin in cold water. Punnoose wakes up. He points at Latika. Jamal and Latika giggle and smile at each other. A bearded henchman lights a candle as Arvind sings for Maman. Maman holds up his hand. Punnoose shakes a bottle into a cloth then quickly smothers Arvind's face with the cloth. Salim looks on, eyes wide, mouth agape. Arvind collapses and Punnoose lifts his limp body to a table. Salim obeys. The bearded man burns a sizzling liquid in a spoon over the flame.",
    "651": "The boys burst into the room. Jamal stares dumbfounded at Latika. She smiles in recognition. Maman and his henchmen stand at the door. Punnoose's face is now badly scarred. She avoids Maman's eyes but doesn't move. He reaches over and grabs her roughly. Salim draws a revolver from behind his back and points it at the men. Jamal looks astonished at his brother. Maman draws closer. Maman leers at Salim. Salim places a cushion over the gun. Jamal recoils in horror. And the men tremble. Latika rushes to take Maman's money from the floor. Jamal is rooted to the spot. The three children flee the scene. On the game show, Jamal looks deep in thought. The host points his hand at Jamal mimicking holding a gun. The scene of Maman's death replays. The host looks down at his computer screen. Young Salim, Jamal, and Latika sneak past the sleeping guard and break into a brand new but unoccupied hotel. They run up a deceased elevator into an atrium door with an enormous gold chandelier. Inside the hotel room, Salim gleefully pours two bottles of spirit into a pot while Jamal picks a towel out of a cupboard. Jamal shakes the dusty towel and takes it to the bathroom door. Salim gulps down some beer. Salim suddenly looks solemn and leaves the room. Salim steps out onto the street. Jamal has his eyes closed and head turned away from a semi-naked Latika. She smiles as he squeezes his eyes tightly shut. She goes back into the bathroom. He keeps his eyes closed for a moment more then slowly opens them. Salim crosses a road busy with tuk-tuks, cars, bicycles, and carts. He approaches a cinema kiosk, hands over a coin, and receives the ticket. On a large balcony above the cinema, six men are drinking and playing a gambling game. None of the men notices Salim as he steps onto the balcony and swaggers over. They ignore Salim as he takes out his gun from behind his back. He points it at one of the men's heads. Salim slowly turns to face Javed, he nods. Javed beckons to Salim. In the hotel room, Jamal and Latika lie on a mattress on the floor. Latika makes graceful hand shadows on the wall. Her arms are painted in intricate gold and henna designs. They stare at each other for a long time. Salim returns to the room. Jamal and Latika snoozing on the mattress. Salim stands over Latika. Both Latika and Jamal wake up. He holds out his hand for Latika. He leans towards Latika. Jamal rushes Salim. Salim eventually overpowers the smaller Jamal and ejects him from the room. Salim emerges, pointing a gun.",
    "655": "The balcony starts to collapse. Peter's webs pull two people away from falling masonry. MJ is stranded on a swaying piece of balcony. Peter runs through the crowd and pulls at his clothes. Underneath them, the Spider-Man costume. A pillar crashes a police car. The glider comes back to the balcony. The Green Goblin holds a pumpkin bomb which incinerates the board members. Harry is hit by a piece of masonry and knocked out. The Green Goblin glides up. Spider-Man swoops down and kicks the goblin from the glider. The goblin lands on top of a marquee. The glider shoots into a hot air balloon and out on the other side. A little boy is rooted to the spot. The world unity festival hoarding is falling towards him. It's Spider-Man to the rescue. Police converge on the Green Goblin. The green meanie easily just punches the cops with his fist. Spider-Man swings in front of him and throws a punch. But the goblin catches his hand, then kicks Spider-Man in the chest, propelling him backwards. He comes to a stop with a lamp post, which crashes onto a passerby. The goblin leaps back onto the glider. The glider is fitted with guns. The goblin pursues the running Spider-Man, firing at it. A missile just misses Spider-Man who leaps onto a large inflatable. Hearing MJ's screams, Spider-Man leaps from inflatable to inflatable and uses one in the same of a kangaroo as a trampoline. Just as he bounces towards the balcony, the Green Goblin on the glider grabs him from behind. He crashes him against the stained glass window and smashes his head repeatedly against it. Spider-Man elbows goblin in the face then breaks free. The two slug it out until Spider-Man falls to MJ. The goblin descends on the glider. Spider-Man shoots a web into goblin's face. Spider-Man cuts an electric car cell from the under side of the glider. As the goblin escaped, MJ falls from the balcony. Spider-Man dives after MJ as she plummets towards the ground and catches her in his arm. The web attached to the balcony holds just as near the other ground and they spring back up in the air. Spider-Man swings her to safety to the up floors of the crowds below. They continue on, high above the streets of Manhattan as people stand and stare. MJ, her arms wrapped tightly around Spider-Man, looks around in wonder and awe both at the experience and with him. He swing past the twin spires of St. Patrick's Cathedral and land on the rocket Rockefeller Center roof garden nearby to the surprise of a canoodling couple. He makes to go. He somersaults off the roof. MJ rushes over to see him swinging back and forth and on the streets.",
    "657": "She places her fingertips on the roll of the mask and tugs it back into place. He shoots out a web and pulls himself up. She has the broadest of grins as she stands in the pouring rain, looking up into the sky. The rain is still falling around them. Then she leans forward, cups his face with her hands and they kiss, a long, lingering kiss. The next day is clear and bright, the sun shining over the skyscrapers of Manhattan. Fire trucks surround a burning apartment building. Flames are roaring out of the top floors. Firemen are evacuating the building's occupants. A woman runs to them. Spider-Man is zooming along the streets, leaping from web to web way above the traffic. Spider-Man swings from a lamp stand at in front of the burning building and leaps in through a window on the lowest of the floors, which is alight. He disappears from the view of those on the ground. A fireman, his face and outfit blackened, stands by the mother, whose hands are closed as if in prayer. They all are calm. Spider-Man reappears at the second explosion. He lands on the sidewalk, baby in arms. The mother pulls back the shawl. A policeman races up. The policeman scrutinizes Spider-Man. Spider-Man hauls himself back up to the top of the building and bursts in through a window. He looks around the blazing inferno. Part of the ceiling caves in. He sees a figure in the distance. He reaches out for the figure, who spins round. It's the Green Goblin. One punch sends Spider-Man sprawling. He throws an orange ball. It explodes into several spinning boomerang type blades. They head for Spider-Man, who leaps acrobatically to avoid them. As he jumps, ducks and weaves, so the Goblin attacks with his gloved fists. Spider-Man fights back and still has to deflect the rotating blades. One cuts his left arm. In a limber darting move, arching his back, Spider-Man avoids another blade. He whips back up, smashes the Goblin in the face, pulls him back with a webbed thread and then volleys him with his left foot through a partition. Using the explosion as cover, Spider-Man beats a hasty retreat. Norman's eyes glaze on his way up to Harry's apartment. Harry and Aunt May are tidying up and MJ has a sniff of a casserole. They hear the elevator gate. Aunt May opens the door. Spider-Man lands outside on his room's window ledge. Harry hears the sound. Norman eyes up MJ. Aunt May calls upstairs. They're all gathered in the living room by the bottom of the stairs. Aunt May starts to make her way up. He whips off his mask.",
    "66": "The Clerk turns away abruptly. He hauls down the northwest valley volume, opens it. It's huge and there's a lot to go through. The print itself makes him squint. Showing TRACT, LOT, PARCEL, even a METES AND BOUNDS designation where the description of the land parcel is long and hopelessly involved e.g.'6000 paces to Rio Seco, thence 7000 paces to Loma Linda, etc.' These descriptions are old and faded. In the owners' column, however there are numerous freshly typed names pasted over the prior owners. The Clerk turns sharply around. Gittes looks a little surprised. The exasperated Clerk reaches around, rummages, slaps a ruler on the desk. Gittes goes back to the stacks with the ruler. He opens the book, places the ruler not horizontally but vertically. Beside the OWNER column he places the ruler, looks toward the clerks, then swiftly rips down the page, tearing out a strip about two inches wide containing the owner's name and property description. As he tears, he either sniffles or coughs to cover the SOUND of the PAPER being ripped. Amidst a hall of shimmering dust and heat, parched and drying groves, narrower roads. Gittes parks at the edge of the field. Gittes is hefted half off the ground and the two younger Farmers spin him around, going through his clothes. They toss his wallet, his silver cigarette case, etc. Gittes is badly banged up and half out on his feet. Gittes' back is to the Red Faced Farmer. Gittes leans against the back of his car, breathing heavily. The Crippled Farmer pokes him rudely in the back with his crutch. Gittes turns sharply. Gittes looks up at the Red Faced Farmer. The paper's on the ground. He picks it up. The Big Farmer takes a swing at Gittes. Gittes kicks him squarely in the nuts, knees him in the jaw after he's doubled up, and hits him solidly. The Crippled Farmer takes careful aim and brings his crutch down on the back of Gittes' head. Gittes is knocked to the ground and lies still beside the Big Farmer who is writhing in agony in the dirt. Is staring down at Gittes who's lying in the screened in porch of the farmers. His wife, the Red Faced Farmer, and the Big Farmer are there, along with the dog. He's got dried blood down the side of his face from his nose, a huge mouse on his cheek, and his clothes are torn in a couple of spots. He looks out. Gittes says nothing. Evelyn driving. Gittes pulls out cigarette case, takes one, offers one to Evelyn who refuses. It's almost evening. He pulls out the obituary column he'd folded up earlier in the day.",
    "662": "On the monitor behind Peter in the Genetic Research Institute, the DNA of a new species of spider like the one which bit Peter is displayed. A man in a green, flight suit is standing on a levitating glider. Norman turns to Strom. The general walks away, leaving a pensive Norman. Inside a suburban house, Peter's Uncle Ben is changing a light bulb. Leaving his concerned aunt and uncle downstairs, Peter absently makes his way upstairs to his room. He strips off his shirt and vest. His skinny frame wavering in front of a tall mirror. He collapses on his bed then rolls off onto the floor. He grabs the tartan blanket lying on top of the bed and hauls it over him. Flashing through Peter's mind are the spiders, the DNA, the helix being split and another part being fused in sending a surge of power through the rest. At Oscorp. Norman strips to the waist and takes bottle from Strom. He gulps down its contents. Having flung the bottle to the floor, Norman lifts opens the metal with strengths on the sliding trolley and lies down on it. Strom fastens the manacles over Norman's chest, legs, and upper arms. Norman is firmly attached to the trolley. The grim-faced Strom hurries over to a control panel. The trolley glides into a large, glass chamber. The doors slide closed. Once inside, the trolley raises from a horizontal position to a vertical one. Norman all the while firmly locked into it. Strom looks on. Norman nods to his colleague. Pushing another switch, Strom watches as a large file containing a green liquid empties. Vapor rises in the chamber. The green vapor engulfs Norman. Strom watches a computer generated image of the level of the green gas in the chamber as it rises to fill it. He then looks at another screen monitoring Norman's physiology. The heart rate increases reaching 140. Norman's body is convulsing. Strom runs to the panel. He starts venting the gas chamber. Norman's head shakes and only the whites of his eye show. The convulsing stops but Norman is held upright by the restraints. He flat lines. Strom enters the chamber. He attempts heart massage standing up. The pulse returns. Norman's eyes flash over. He grabs Strom by the throat. He flings Strom through the glass of the chamber. Now freed, Norman leaps out strong. Peter wakes from his fitful sleep and picks himself up off the floor. Peter reaches for his spectacles. He puts them on, then quickly takes them off. He tries again and once more removes them. He holds them up in front of his face. When he looks through them everything is blurred. When he moves them away his vision is clear.",
    "664": "Flash glares. As Peter walks out of the swing doors, so the tray is trapped on the swing shot. Later Peter strides towards his lock and examining his wrist as he goes. Flash marches after him pushing students out of his way. Peter stands staring at his unopened locker. He hears a paper airplane zooming down the corridor towards a fly hovering by the fire alarm bell. In slow motion he hears a spit word being propelled from a blow pipe. Then a fist. He swerves to his side as Flash's punch lands on the locker door. Flash even with his left hand aims two punches at Peter who gobs and weaves out of the way. Then in slow motion Flash throws another punch which Peter just swerves away from. Then a punching white. Peter arches his back as they are doing a lingo dance and evades it. To avoid Flash's colleague Peter flips into the air, somersaults and lands on his feet. Flash charges again. He fails to connect. Peter grabs his arm, then he punches Flash. Then he slides on his back down the corridor, collides with a teacher carrying the tray and ends up with more food on him. MJ looks at him in wonder. Flash's crony. Harry seems awestruck. MJ un-sure. And Peter looks confused and a little frightened. He races off. Peter runs across a street intersection and comes to a gateway leading into an alley. He stops out of sight of the passersby on the sidewalk and scrutinizes his wrist where the web shot from. He then turns over his hand to examine again the swollen bite mark. He looks up and sees a spider's web woven round the coils of barbed wire above the gateway entrance. He moves his hands closer to his face. On the pads of his fingertips barbed bristles are beginning to grow. Peter stares at the brick building behind him. Then one after the other, places his hand on the surface and starts to climb. With competitive ease Peter scales the high sided brick building, his fingertips almost sticking to the surface as he makes his way out. Halfway up he stops and looks down. Peter is running across the roofs of tall buildings and bleeping across the gaps between them. Two children playing with a skipping rope are oblivious as Peter lounges himself into the air way above their heads. He lands on another roof and comes to a halt at the edge. Once again, he scrutinizes his wrist. Opposite him and across the road is a crane. Peter thinks for a moment then loops from his wrist to the crane. He thrust his arm forward towards the jib.",
    "668": "Down below, the hijacked car takes a right gliding behind him and sending water into the air. Still, the police pursued the stolen car. Up above Spider-Man is gaining on. He comes lower and lower until he can leap out of the roof of his uncle's car. He punches through it. Spider-Man grabs hold of the carjacker, who pulls a gun. As gunshots pepper the roof of the car, Spider-Man leaps up to the roof of a passing truck. Balancing on both feet, he keeps his eyes firmly on the stolen car. A bridge moves ahead. Spider-Man vaults into the air, across the bridge, and lands back on the roof of the truck. Spider-Man throws himself onto the cars ballot and punches through the windscreen. The car swerves, hits a ball out, then crashes into a set of iron gates. A posse of police cars builds up behind a smashed vehicle. The carjacker has made his escape from the vehicle and is creeping to a darkened warehouse. His gun is held shakily in his left hand. As he reloads his piece, a shadow looms above his head. He's been surround. He shoots at the moving shadow. Trying to run from it, he fails to see Spider-Man lowering himself for a better look. At a locked door, Spider-Man catches up with him. He smashes the car thief's head into the glass panels on the door then sends him flying across the room. The thief lunges with a knife. Spider-Man kicks it from his grasp. Balaclava off. Peter strides forward. Peter grabs the man by the lapel. It's the thief from the arena. He remembers only too well letting the man pass. He reflects on Uncle Ben lying on the ground then backs away. The thief raises his gun. He holds it to Peter's forehead. Peter knocks the hand away and twists the thief's arm. The gun drops. The thief staggers back and trips. A police's spotlight illuminates a second floor window through which the thief has fallen. It moves down to pick out where he has landed face down. Peter gazes down from the darkness. The spotlight returns to the window. His features lit up, Peter turns in horror. Police swarm all over the warehouse. They creep forward, guns held at one hand and torch lights in the other. They reach the window to find no one there. Peter is sitting with his elbows resting on his knees out in the open air. A light breeze ruffling his short dark hair. His face sad had his eyes moist. Around and beneath him, the lights of New York. He opens the front door of his home. Inside, sitting in the darkness is Aunt May wrapped in her padded housecoat.",
    "670": "Set against a moody blue sky with towering white and gold clouds, a woman in Grecian-style robes holds aloft a shining torch. Pages of comic magazines. A spider's web is behind the letters which break up and vanish from the screen. Images of the principal actors. Peter Parker and his new muscular body. Then as the prototype Spider-Man and the wrestling green cage. Peter not stopping the thief, then kneeling by his dying uncle. The beginnings of the Spider-Man costume. More titles. Spider-Man stands over Norman Osborn as Harry walks into the room. Peter Parker, at his uncle Ben's graveside. Peter walks away from MJ in the graveyard. Peter gazes at a poster of MJ, the face of parfumerie Emma Rose. As a pizza boy. Peter gazes blankly. Traffic is at a standstill. Peter, on his moped, weaves his way through cars and yellow cabs. A taxi pulls out in front of Peter. Stack on the back of a moped, there are Pizzas. A taxi stops in front of Peter and he swings round in front of it. He sees the lights change and a bus passes in front. He looks up at the clock. Another minute takes by. Now, on foot, Peter runs into an alley, ripping off his crash helmet as he does so. A guy watches the alley entrance. Out swings Spider-Man with the pizza. Soaring his way through the skyscrapers, the costumed character is far above land. He spots two kids running onto the street. Huge truck coming their way. He tosses the pizzas and swings down to pluck kids away from truck. He sets them gently on the ground. A man steps out onto a balcony and turns to see the pizzas on the balustrade. As the man on the balcony teases out a slice of pizza, Spider-Man swishes past, grabbing the pizzas. He lands on a building nearby. The man goes to eat the pizza slice as it's whipped from his hand by a web. Inside the building Spider-Man landed on, a receptionist sits at a desk in a hallway with black-and-white checkered flooring. She looks round on hearing the noise and sees a cupboard door opening. From it emerges Peter, carrying the pizzas. The brooms in the cupboard fall out behind him. Chewing her gum intently she watches as he struggles to push the mops and brushes back inside. With one final thrust, Peter pushes back the brooms and slams the door. He picks up the pizza boxes, then notices something stuck to the top. It's some spider's web. The receptionist eyes him curiously as he pulls the stretchy, silky substance off and stuffs it in the back pocket of his jeans. He strides up to the desk and lays the pizzas on it.",
    "671": "He raises it to his lips to find that it's already been drunk. He tips it upside down, and its little umbrella falls to the floor. Back inside, Harry staggers up to him. He slaps Peter's face a second time. Peter's head swings to one side, then he turns to face Harry. The two eyeball each other before Harry, tight-lipped, turns and walks away. Peter lowers his head. Her arms folded, MJ looks slightly flustered as the guests applaud. She opens the palm of her hand towards John and moves up to the podium to join him, watched by a stunned Peter. Peter raises the camera to his eye. The lights of the Empire State Building form the backdrop for Spider-Man to swing slowly and gently through the city. He stretches out his right hand and flexes his wrist. He tries again and again, then falls. He lands face down in a puddle. Rises, pulls off the mask then flexes his wrists. Still nothing happens. He studies his fingertips, then looks up at the building to his right. Standing alone in an alley, he moves to the building. Places his hands on its surface and starts to climb. He moves rapidly up the outside of the building, climbing with ease. He starts to slip down, then comes to a halt. Grasping for a handle, he slips back into the puddle. He shakes his wet hands and leans back against a rubbish skip. He notices a newspaper hanging over the side. He grabs it and screws up his eyes to try to read the headline and focus on the picture. In his room, he tosses it away. Looking dejected, Peter sits on his bed. He takes the back of his left hand up to his forehead and wipes his brow. Octavius is at the desk in his lab. The four mechanical limbs busying themselves around him. One holds a cigar to his mouth. Another lights it for him. Octavius raises the dark glasses he's wearing from his eyes. Puffs on the cigar, then blows the match. Louise and MJ in a shoe store. Peter's at his doctor being examined. He points to his head. The doctor nods, then heaves himself up onto the examination couch to sit beside Peter. He nods again, and Peter reflects. Peter sits in his room, his head against the wall. Big flashes illuminate the darkness. Peter's eyes are bright. Sitting in the front seat of a car, the old man holds out his hand. Peter looks at the hand, only inches from him. He purses his lips. His face screws up and his eyes flicker. He turns his gaze on Uncle Ben who stares right back at him, a sad expression on his face.",
    "672": "In his room, Peter, his shadow thrown behind him onto the wall, stares at his own hand held out. His back resting on a pillow, Peter stares into space. His steely blue eyes bright and determined. Outside in a dark alley with ominous clouds in the sky, Peter stands with his Spider-Man costume held out in front of him. The wind ruffles his hair as he remains still for a moment. He drops the costume, then walks down the alley and away from the dust bin into which he has consigned the last vestige of the super hero. The sun shines as Peter with a jaunty gait strides through the city. Peter trips on the sidewalk. He awkwardly gets to his feet, reaches into his pocket and hauls out his spectacles. He flicks them open, puts them on, and sets off a little wet. At home, he tightens up a wheel on his moped and spins it. The wheel rolls off the front forks and bounces out of the open window. He strolls away from a hot dog man and stands at the curve. Cop cars and vans and officers on foot race off in one direction. Peter munches his hot dog and sets off in the other. In his room, he studies. Peter's hand goes up. Peter grins proudly. On the campus, doctor Connors races up to him. Peter stops and smiles. At the theater. MJ is distracted when she sees Peter in the audience. He grins inanely. She smiles sweetly. She ignores the prompt. She turns to her costar. MJ and Peter walk down the street side-by-side. Peter, standing beside her, gazes at her earnestly. Then they both resume walking. He looks at her through doleful eyes, and she scrutinizes his features. She turns away and crosses to a yellow cab. She opens the door of the cab and, before getting in, turns to look at him once more. Peter half smiles as MJ steps into the cab, shuts the door and watches as the cab drives away. He slips on his spectacles. At the Bugle, a headline is being composed. Jameson's on the phone. He pulls Spider-Man's mask from a bag. Out comes the rest of the costume. The disgruntled garbage man goes. Robbie fondles the mask. In his office, Jameson in the Spider-Man costume, minus the mask, leaps onto his desk a big cigar in his mouth. He flexes his wrists as if shooting out webs. His staff peer in through the slatted blinds. Robbie shakes his head. Two girls overtake him and giggle. He smiles and walks on past an alleyway. He sees two muggers attacking a dark-haired youth. Peter turns his back away, leaving the muggers punching and kicking their fallen victim.",
    "675": "Peter stares through his dark-rimmed spectacles, then blinks. A lone figure stands on the flat roof of a tall Manhattan building. Down below, a street with four lanes of parked traffic. Across from it, another flat-roofed building. The figure is Peter, who strides with purpose away from the edge. His face full of resolve, he stops. Peter runs towards it, past the skylight jutting up, his face set in grim determination. His jaw clenched, his teeth gritted. He pumps his arms forward and back, as his pace increases and his stride lengthens. Pigeons take to the air as Peter passes. His eyes are focused on where he's going. He flings both arms back, then thrusts them forward as he leaps off the roof. His arms and legs flailing, he soars through the air. A washing line breaks his fall. He swings on it against the wall. Onto the roof of a car, rolls off it and hits another vehicle. He lifts himself up. He looks to see how far he's fallen, clutches his back and hobbles between the cars and out of the alley parking lot. He leans on a parked car for support. John's at MJ's. MJ opens wedding acceptance cards. He kisses her outstretched hand. She studies him closely. He's lying on the sofa. He turns over and tips his head back on a cushion on the arm of the sofa. MJ, on her knees, leans over him, kissing him full on the lips, her head pointing the opposite way from his. He stretches out his left hand, and holds her head still. MJ moves her head away and closes her mouth and her eyes. MJ's lost in memories. Her long hair trails down over his cheek, until MJ pulls back. She opens her mouth in a silent sigh, and looks sad and reflective. MJ is sitting in a cafe with a glass front, leaning her head on her hand. Peter strolls in, and sits opposite her. He looks down as she stares intently into his face. Her eyes are fixed on him. Her face grows sad. He shakes his head. MJ purses her lips. Her eyes flit left and right. His head shakes slightly, as he gazes sorrowfully into her blue eyes. He looks at the table. She lowers her head, then raises it. Tears well in MJ's eyes. Her lips quiver. She leans forward. Peter looks up, surprised. She lays her hand on his. Her engagement ring shines brightly. Peter's eyes move up from her hand to her face. She stretches further across the table. He edges his mouth closer to hers, then stops. Her eyes are closed. Her lips offer to him. His eyes widen as a car comes flying towards the window.",
    "676": "It crashes through. Peter dives across the table at MJ, snatches her into his arms and flings her and him to the floor. The car flies past their heads. It lands upside down on its roof in the middle of the cafe. Peter helps MJ to her feet. They hear the thuds coming from outside. The ground shakes. Peter sees the three-pronged pincers at the end of a mechanical limb clomp towards the cafe, bearing up Otavious with him. One of the limbs drags Peter to Octavius. A limb removes Octavius' shades. The mechanical limb clutching Peter throws him across the cafe but he slams against the back wall and falls to the floor, surrounded by debris. Octavius smiles at MJ. With MJ firmly in a grasp, Octavius uses the other three to stride away. He, himself, is high in the hair, the four limbs protruding from the metal spine. The three walking limbs stride over to a building, up its side. Octavius, the limbs and ends disappear from view. Peter bursts from under the rubble. Peter stands still for a moment, his jaw firm, and then he runs out onto the street. Through his glasses, the outlines of people are fuzzy. He takes them off and can see perfectly. He slips them back on. He takes them off again and drops them to the ground. A thick lens falls from the frame as it bounces. Peter clinches his fist tightly, looks around. Then, eyes blazing, he strides on. At the Bugle, Robbie walks into the editor's office. Jonah's eyes grow weary. The Spider-Man costume hangs on the wall. He turns his back. Spider-Man swoops and soars once more through the streets of New York, making his way, speeding in a straight flying using the webs extending from his wrists as a means of propulsion to haul him along between the tall buildings. As Spider-Man nears the Westside Tower, Octavius clamors up over its clock face. Spider-man is on the flag pole at its peak. A limb clatters into it. The two engage in hand-to-hand fighting. Two fists against six. Spider-Man is thrown. He grabs a clock hand. A limb knocks it off. Spider-Man falls. He flicks web balls off the face, then catches the falling hand with another web. He flings it up at Octavius. It embeds itself in the wall next to Octavius. Two limbs hold apart breaking it in half, then hurls both pieces at Spider-Man. A limb punches Spider-Man down. He attaches two webs over Otavious and pulls him. Both men descend. Locked together, they crash onto the roof of a passing train. The two bounce along the carriage roofs. The train continues its way between the city buildings, as the two men rise and face eachother.",
    "682": "Underwater, the body of Octavius, the four limbs still attached to him, floats downwards, as does the sphere. The entire lab sinks below the surface of the river. High on a crane, Spider-Man has woven a web over which he crawls to MJ. He lies beside her way above the river, the lights of the city twinkling far below them. She looks earnestly at him. He stares at her. She screws up her face and fights back tears. Down below, a convoy of squad cars speeds towards the waterside. Up on the web attached to the crane, MJ turns to face Spider-Man once more. He half-smiles. Later, he eases her down towards the ground with an ever-lengthening string of web emanating from his wrist. As she glides elegantly down from on high, the convoy of cars draws closer to her, their lights flashing. The lead car slues to its left and stops. The passenger door opens and out steps John, who looks up at the descending MJ. As she lands on the bridge of a boat, John races towards her. She turns on hearing him approach. John leaps from the pier onto the boat, then clambers upstairs as MJ descends towards him. Meeting in the middle, they hug tightly. As John nuzzles her neck, MJ looks across and up to the crane. A distant figure squats there in true Spider-Man pose. Peter slips on the mask. He looks at the city, then round to MJ, before leaping into the night sky carried by a web. Tears trickle down MJ's face as she rests her head on John's shoulder. Harry sits alone in the apartment, fondling the blade of the dagger with which he'd intended to kill Spider-Man. Hearing a noise, Harry gets to his feet, the dagger in his right hand. He takes a few paces forward and listens. A door opposite him swings open. Harry looks anxiously around and stares up at the balcony surrounding the room. He turns to the full-length mirror. He stares at his late father. Harry shakes his head. Harry flings the dagger at the mirror. It crashes through his father's reflection to reveal a room beyond. Stupefied, Harry moves to the mirror doorway. Avoiding the jagged pieces of broken mirror, Harry slides through into a brick chamber. There are cobwebs, which he brushes aside. He strides through, then turns, catching sight of something out of the corner of his eye. The mask of the Green Goblin. Harry crashes into a set of shelves filled with spherical bombs. There are row upon row of the weapons his father once used. Harry catches sight of a cylindrical vial containing a phosphorescent green liquid. He picks it up, examines it, then marches into another section of the secret chamber.",
    "684": "A convertible smashes into a chasing police car, which is drawn alongside, then heads straight for Peter. Peter leaps in the air over the convertible, completes a backwards somersault and lands, poised. The car chase is still on. One of the guys in the convertible pumps a shotgun. The leading police car spins. The second hits it. The third swerves to avoid it. It catapults into the air and drops towards a group of bystanders. It stops, suspended above them. Cowering, they all look closely at the squad car seemingly hanging in midair. It's caught in a web. Spider-Man swings past. Spider-Man slips between the cab and trailer of a truck as he pursues the convertible. Spider-Man soars, dives and weaves to avoid the bullets being pumped directly at him. He fires two web pulls. He lands on the car's boot. He ensnares the men's weapons in their hands and tosses them over an overhead light, the men still attached. On stage. MJ stares at Peter's empty seat. Peter screeches up to the theater in the convertible. Peter leaves the car, then enters the theater. Peter bends down to tie his shoelace watched by the usher, then straightens up. His tie is crooked. The usher in a waistcoat and dicky bow points to his tie. Peter straightens his necktie, then steps forward. He produces the ticket. The usher folds his arms. Peter walks to the door, then turns back. The usher gestures, locking his mouth. Peter looks at his ticket and glares at him. Peter sits on a stoop opposite the theater. A nearby street musician plays. Peter watches her, then closes his eyes and shakes his head incredulously. He steps forward, watching expectantly. MJ comes out through the stage door. A girl comes out after her. Peter smiles contentedly. Peter's smile fades as he sees the guy kissing MJ. Peter watches a police car fly past, followed by a few more. His attention returns to MJ. Then he looks down sadly and moves off. MJ and her man walk off, arm-in-arm. MJ looks around briefly as if expecting to see Peter, but there's nobody there. Peter enters a steam-filled backstreet. He breaks into a run, then tears open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man costume. He pulls on the red mask, leaps into the air, casting a web line to pull himself up. Later, a group of squad cars weave their way down a wide city street. Above them, Spider-Man swings from building to building. Hanging mid-swing, he flicks his wrists. He falls 10 stories, landing on some metal. He hauls himself up from the now dented pipe. He takes off his Spider-Man mask and examines his wrist.",
    "685": "He leaps over the edge of the building and peers down at the street below. He tries to fire a web, but again nothing happens. He looks down at the street way below and waddles slightly. He pouts and frowns. Later, a man with a dog is waiting for an elevator. The doors open and the man is about to enter when he pauses, seeing a fully suited Spider-Man standing casually inside. Looking Spidey up and down, the man steps into the elevator and presses a floor button. Spider-Man looks down a little self-consciously. The man nods understandingly. The man puts his card back in his pocket. Spider-Man looks away from the man, then bows his head and stares at the wall. The man looks up at the floor display as it changes from 10 to nine. Spider-Man leans forward and presses a button. Later, Peter traipses down a deserted sidewalk. He passes a wall which has been plastered with MJ's perfume ads, showing her soft, pretty face. He looks at the images briefly, then carries on going, a preoccupied look on his face. He's dragging his broken moped along behind him. Peter sits doodling in Doctor Connors' class. He's drawn his face, half Peter Parker and half Spider-Man. On a pay phone outside. MJ comes home. MJ looks peeved. MJ gazes hopefully at the phone. She turns away. Peter slaps the phone, then shakes his head incredulously. Talking into the receiver, he looks up and shakes his head. He hangs up. Guests have gathered in Doctor Octavius' lab. Peter and Harry are amongst them. Octavius pulls off a dust sheet to reveal a device with four long mechanical limbs. He peels off his gray lab coat. He steps onto a platform, then taps keys on a freestanding control panel. The metal harness snaps into position around his waist. A mechanical spine curls up onto his back. A blue computer chip at the top of the synthetic spine glows, then a series of pins slide into his skin. He grimaces. His audience gasps. Octavius concentrates hard and stares up at the ceiling. The four metal limbs begin to move, rising up like snakes. On the end of each arm is a pointed pincer which opens out. Octavius reaches out his own arms. The four mechanical limbs hover above his head. Peter's eyes are wide. Equipment units are wheeled aside. The lights go out. Across the room stands a machine with a base from which four curved pillars rise. Octavius controls one of the mechanical arms. The pincer retracts. A much smaller pincer opens. A tube rises from a panel. The small pincer plucks a tiny sphere from inside it. The small pincer releases the sphere, which floats in the air between the four pillars of the machine.",
    "686": "The sphere begins to spin. Rosie approaches Octavius and smiles. He smiles back and takes a pair of dark goggles from her. He puts the high-tech goggles on. He taps keys on a control panel. Laser projectors mounted at the top and bottom of each curved pillar fire a slender yellowish beam through the tiny sphere. The eight beams cause the sphere to glow and spin faster. The sphere suddenly expands into a fiery ball resembling the Sun. An old scientist to Harry. The mechanical arms grasp onto an energy field which surrounds the glowing sphere. Peter looks down and sees a paper clip lift up off the floor. It shoots towards the fusion machine. Air ducts on the ceiling swing towards the machine, as do the hanging lights. Peter stares up, bathed in an orange glow. Looking a little flustered, Octavius taps on a control panel. Necklaces and other personal objects get sucked into the sphere. Octavius peers around at his anxious-looking wife. Peter moves away. Harry looks around. Metal panels are sucked off the walls. An arc of white-hot energy blasts out of the sphere and cuts into the ceiling. An equipment unit rolls towards Harry. Spider-Man swings him to safety. Spider-Man leaps onto the ceiling. Octavius looks up. Octavius swings a mechanical arm at Spider-Man, knocking him against the wall. A small energy arc leaps out from the sun's sphere. The windows implode. Shards of glass fly towards Octavius' wife. Her face reflected in one of them. It heads straight for her eye. Octavius sees her slump to the floor. An arc of energy surges from the sphere and short-circuits the inhibitor chip. Spider-Man leaps over to the far cables and tugs on them. Sparks fly out. Octavius' body stops shaking and he drops to the floor along with the mechanical arms. The power cables come away and Spider-Man backflips onto the floor. The sphere implodes, then bursts into a cloud of fiery particles before imploding again. Darkness fills the land. Emergency vehicles arrive at the scene. Two singed scientists leave the building. Harry trudges onto the street. He wears an angry expression. An Oscorp exec. Lying on a stretcher trolley, Rosie's dead body is covered and wheeled over to an ambulance. With not a scratch on him, Peter wanders out of the building. At a hospital, medics are about to operate on an unconscious Octavius. The doctor points to graphics on a screen. Octavius' mechanical limbs are suspended from the ceiling. The doctor starts up a circular saw. He stops, hearing a sound, and looks up. A pulley hanging from the ceiling swings. Edgy, the doctor prepares to cut one of the limbs. As he lowers the blade, he sees something reflected in another medic's goggles.",
    "687": "He spins around. One of the limbs knocks him through a glass door. The other three break free and start moving. One grabs a woman by the leg. A male medic is thrown across the operating room. Another limb smashes through a table and clamps onto a man's face, then tosses him across the room. A man is smashed into a lamp and electrocuted. The nurse is dragged along the floor by the leg. Octavius lies face down on the operating table, a bandage over his eyes. The nurse's fingernails cut grooves in the floor. A man is grabbed by the throat, then slammed against the table. He spots a chainsaw. Another medic is rammed into a wall. The doctor by the chainsaw reaches for it, but is pushed to the floor. The chainsaw pulls down weakly. He tries in vain to cut into the limb that's pinning him to the wall. The other three limbs sense danger and move towards him, viewing him with inbuilt cameras. The mechanical limbs move in for the kill. The chainsaw drops to the floor on the end of the man's limbed arm. Octavius lifts his head. Using its small pincer, one of the mechanical limbs gently pulls the bandage from his eyes. Octavius opens his eyes and looks about him wearily. His brow, alarm spreads over his face, and he kneels up on the operating table, the limbs rising with him. He tips back his head. Later, doors fly off the hinges. A yellow cab speeds towards him, then skids to a halt. Octavius cringes, then seems surprised when mechanical limbs lift the cab up and through to the air, it lands on another yellow taxi. Viewed through the fractured windscreen of the cab, two of the limbs move up to Octavius' face. Now, they detect a siren. Octavius slips away. Later, with the long mechanical limbs acting as legs, Octavius is carried onto a bridge tower. The pincers spot a ramshackle pier and a derelict warehouse way below. Octavius peers down at it. A sunny day in his office, Jameson addresses bulky Robbie. Jameson's surprised. He shoos Peter away. Octavius is in the warehouse on the dilapidated pier. He stares down through gaping holes in the floor. The mechanical limbs move slowly about him, like mythical serpents. He looks at the reptilian limbs in desperation. He stares forlornly into the water. Two of the limbs open their pincers aggressively. All four mechanical limbs hover, their pincers open. His face strained, his eyes widen and he reaches behind his head. He spins back around. The pincers near his face and move, as if talking. Octavius closes his eyes. Troubled, he stares hard at the floor.",
    "694": "Harry turns back to the stove and pours his egg. Mary Jane sprinkles on the cheese. Harry adds some rocket. He flicks the omelette in half. He tries to toss it in the pan. Half of it falls to the floor. Later, they read the script. Mary Jane brushes Harry's dark hair back from his brow then lets her gaze meet his adoring eyes. She pulls him towards her. They kiss. Mary Jane breaks off with a guilty look. Harry watches helplessly as she hurries down the black and white marble floored hallway into the lift. He storms into the study, grabs at the canter, and takes his wig. His father's portrait glowers down at him. Harry gates. He turns towards a tall mirror. Harry stares at his reflection and moves slowly towards it, hand outstretched. As his fingers touched the glass, in flashback, he sees Spider-Man standing over Norman's body and remembers pulling the Spider-Man mask off Peter's face. Harry remembers falling and waking up in the hospital. Harry's father looks back at him from the mirror. At night, Mary Jane comes home and hits the light switch. The lights don't come on. Harry in his goblin suit grabs Mary Jane by the throat. Hovering on his sky stick, he holds up against the wall. Ursula, the landlord's daughter, smiles awkwardly. He hurries into the hallway. Peter nervously takes up the receiver. A couple strolled by the boating lake in Central Park. Peter, wearing a blue jumper over a blue shirt and jeans and clutching a small posy of flowers, stops in his tracks as he spots Mary Jane standing alone in the middle of a graceful cast iron bridge. He hurries on to meet her. He offers up the flowers. She looks at them unhappily. She turns aside, putting her hand over her eyes. Peter fumbles in his pocket for Aunt May's ring. Peter, looking as if he's been hit in the stomach, watches in numb shock as she hurries away off the bridge. A little way further along the lake, Harry is leaning against a tree observing the scene. He turns with a cruel smile as Mary Jane comes past, arms folded, and glares at him. Mary Jane turns away angrily and carries on. Harry lets his head drop against the tree trunk with a smile of satisfaction. Later, he meets Peter in a coffee shop. Harry draws breath. Peter looks Harry in the eye. Peter shakes his head and looks away in a daze. Blinking in shock and disbelief, Peter gets up and leaves. A waitress comes over to Harry with a coffee jar. Harry grins. Peter, crossing the road, turns and looks back.",
    "695": "Harry smiles and winks. A truck briefly blocks Peter's view. When it passes, Harry has disappeared from the coffee shop. Peter turns and looks around the street, eyes wide, mouth half open. Later, he sits on the bed in his room, hands clasped between his knees. Staring ahead, his expression cold and malevolent. Slowly, his eyes swiveled to the corner of the room. He turns his head and homes in on the black trunk on the floor of the closet. Lightning flashes in a dark sky. In his father's study, Harry pours himself a martini and adds a couple of olives. Sensing Peter behind him, he smiles without looking around. Harry sips his drink. Peter, wearing the black suit under his normal clothes, punches Harry. Peter's eyes widened. Harry stabbed him in the thigh with a dagger. As they fight, a row of curved blades shoot out in Harry's forearm. Peter hauls him into a pummeled wall. Harry swings at it. Harry smashes his arm at Peter's head. The blades get stuck in the pillar behind. Peter slams his fist down on Harry's arm, breaking off the blades. Harry kicks him across the table. They circle each other. Peter kicks Harry through a glass partition. Harry wipes blood from his mouth. He dives at Peter who hauls him against another window. Peter throws Harry across the room. Harry picks himself up. They run at each other and crash through into the secret goblin lair. As Peter chases him through the lair, Harry picks up the goblin sword and swings it at him. Peter dodges the blade. Harry accidentally cuts through the table, tethering the sky stick, sending it spinning out of control. Peter pushes Harry's head up into the path of the sky stick. Harry's thrown against the wall of glass shelves and crashes to the ground. Peter flaws Harry with a final blow and walks away. Harry finds a pumpkin bomb to hand and hauls it after him. Peter lassos the bomb with a web and hauls it back, explode in Harry's face. Peter strolls along a street, fastening his shirt collar over the Black Spider-Man suit. Several women passing by give him the eye. At a newsstand, the Daily Bugle photo shows Black Spider-Man robbing a bank. In the Bugle office, Brock's celebrating. Brock hangs up a framed glow up of the front page. Peter comes up behind him. Peter drops a photo on the desk. Peter slams Brock against the wall. Brock looks around, smiling nervously. Peter hands Robby, the sub-editor, the original print from which Brock has faked the bank robbery shot. In Jameson's office, Jameson slaps the photo down. Floppy-head Peter is in his hallway with Ursula.",
    "698": "He looks up the vertiginous tower as if he were at the deep of a deep well. Peter tears up the tattered skin tight black fabric across his chest. Above him, Peter tears the unraveling Symbiote from his body. The slimy black Symbiote slithers off the edge of the ledge that Peter's on and snakes down the bell tower. A slither of Symbiote falls onto Brock's shoulder. A globule lands in the palm of Brock's hand and spreads around him. As more lands on his shoulder, it wraps itself around his body like ivy consuming the walls of a building. Brock drops to his hands and knees, consumed by the black tendrils that pushed him to the floor as if he were stuck in a pool of tar. The Symbiote devours Brock's face. Like a wild cat with ferocious jagged teeth, he lurches forward as venom. Later in his room, Peter is in the shower with the water streaming over his tightly closed eyes. Slowly, his hooded dark eyes open with a dead vacant expression. A short time later, he's sitting on his floor for lonely leaning against the French windows. He trudges to the door and holds the door, which comes off in his hand. He prices the door open with his fingertips. Aunt May looks around his shabby room. He puts the door knob down on a shelf. He holds out the engagement ring and drops it into the palm of her hand. He turns away from his aunt's inquiring eyes and goes over to the French windows. His mournful face is lit by a ghostly blue blow from the city outside. Aunt May puts the ring on the table and Peter half turns towards her. As she softly leaves the room Peter turns his doleful gaze back to the window. In a skin tight black Spider Man style suit Venom swinging through the city on pretz. He is grabbed by Flint in an alleyway. Venom Berziz finds Flint, tosses him to one side. At night Peter walks under the illuminated canopy of the theater across the street from Mary Jane's apartment building. In a lit top floor window he catches a glimpse of Mary Jane as she moves about her apartment. His sorrowful blue eyes slowly moisten and fill with tears. He bows his head and scocks away. As Peter trudges off down the street Mary Jane looks out of the window at the deserted corner where he was standing moments earlier. A short time later she comes out of her apartment block in her waitress uniform and hails a cab. Armored vehicles are tossed to side like toys by bursts of sand. Peter's in a crowd outside an electrical store watching the TV coverage in wide-eyed shock.",
    "703": "Harry falls to the floor of the building Mary Jane is on. Mary Jane runs to him. Peter desperately tugs at the black threads holding his wrists. He frees one hand and grabs a sharp spear of metal as Venom leaps at him. Cutting himself free, he knocks Venom away. Peter grabs two of the pipes. Venom falls to his knees. Peter spears the two pipes into the floor, grabs two more, and does the same, building a circular fence around Venom. The monster reels and half-disintegrates from the noise. Brock's face appears from within the symbiotic suit. Peter shoots a thread, pulls him free, and holds him through the bars. Behind Peter, the black spiky Venom suit assumes a life of its own, growing and flailing about. Peter and Brook look on in amazement as it tries to break out of its cage. Peter strikes the bells to make them ring then grabs a pumpkin bomb. Brook leaps in after the bomb. Peter puts a hand to his face to shield it from the blast. When the spot clears, there's nothing left of the Brook or the Symbiote. Behind him Flint materializes, sand pouring from his arm. Mary Jane runs down to where Harry lies on his back. She nods. Up above, Peter drops the tube he was carrying, his expression numb. Peter turns to find Flint right behind him. Peter's eyes narrow fractionally. As Peter listens, Flint's eyes become distant as he thinks back. In black and white flashback, Uncle Ben sits in his car. Flint comes up with a gun and taps on the window. Uncle Ben squeezes Flint's shoulder. In flashback, the accomplice runs up to Flint from behind and knocks him on the shoulder as he makes for the car. The gun discharges. Uncle Ben's eyes close, and he falls to the ground. Flint looks on eyes wide with horror. He kneels over the dying man as his partner drives away. Flint lowers his eyes for a moment then looks back up at Peter. Peter frowns as he struggles to understand. Then lowers his grief-stricken eyes and nods to himself. He looks back at Flint who meets his steadfast gaze. Flint goes over to the edge of the skyscraper and looks down at the emergency vehicles far below. A pale, dawn light is spreading across the sky above them. He looks at the silver locket he holds in his hand, with its tiny photograph of his daughter, and turns back to Peter. His eyes brimming, Flint looks sorrowfully but steadily at Peter, who nods with a look of understanding. The ghost of a smile flickers across Peter's face. Flint nods faintly and starts to disintegrate into a whirling eddy of sand.",
    "706": "He tries to run off but one of the capacitors hits him, throwing him back onto the sand. The air is thick with sand as he gets to his feet, trying to shield his face. Tiny granules of high velocity sand fly into his pores and shatter into fragments, fusing with his own molecules, giving his internal structure a sand-like appearance. Flint's hand becomes sand and his fingers blow away in a fierce wind. His entire body turns to sand and is eaten away by the wind until he completely disintegrates. The cops arrive at the edge of the pit and look down to find the capacitors slowing down and Flint nowhere to be seen. Peter sits alone in a hospital corridor, staring blankly at the paper cup in his hand. He looks up and hurriedly stands as a doctor approaches. The dark haired, bearded doctor goes, leaving Peter looking pensive. With a tentative step, he passes the window of a private room and looks inside. Harry is lying in bed with a bandage wrapped around his head. He turns to face the doorway and smiles as Peter steps inside. Mary Jane comes in. Mary Jane and Peter step into the corridor. Peter looks relieved. In the room, the nurse smiles at Harry. Large rocks roll and clink against each other. Seen from further away, the rocks look more like gravel, and from even further away the gravel reveals itself as millions of grains of sand which sweep along the floor of the pit like waves on a beach. The sand forms a curving shape, almost like a human body. The undulating shape rises up as though to stand, then slumps down again. The shape reforms and slowly rises in the form of a human torso from the waist up. It's Flint, now transformed into Sandman. Sandman raises his arms and examines his bulky, paw-like hands. He looks down at his body of sand, then holds his hands to his large, round head. Sandman looks at the mound of sand next to him and spots the locket Penny gave him lying nearby. He reaches out to pick up the locket but the loose sand of his hand just crumbles around it. He reaches out again and his hand becomes more human, with slim, mobile fingers. He picks up the locket between his finger and thumb, then drops it into his palm. The locket falls open, revealing Penny's picture inside. Sandman's hollow eyes look melancholy as they gaze down at the picture. He clenches the locket in his fist and hauls himself up from the sand like a man climbing out of a swamp. He stumbles as he finds his footing, then slowly steps forward, gradually becoming more human until he looks exactly as he did before the change, right down to his brown hair, green and black striped t-shirt, and beige chinos.",
    "707": "He smiles and looks at the ring. Peter slips the ring into the pocket of his jeans and opens the door to Mary Jane. She holds up a newspaper. He gives her a warm, guarded smile. She sits down. Peter smiles feebly. She nods, sadly. Mary Jane looks down, dejectedly. Peter in his Spider-Man suit gives her a little smile before putting on his head mask and leaping out of the window. Mary Jane stands up, gathers her bag, scarf, and newspaper, and goes for the door. Across the room, the black spider-like tendril crawls across a cabinet behind her, but freezes when she looks around. She leaves the apartment and the slimy, black mass drops to the floor. On a city street, two cops look up to the sky. A huge, towering jib crane swings around as its driver struggles with the controls. Gwen's part of a photo shoot in an office. The photographer checks his shot. Gwen and the other two models turn to the window as an enormous steel girder hanging from a chain swings towards them. They throw themselves to the floor as the girder smashes through the window. It rips out the supports along one corner of the building. A desk and other debris plummet to the ground. Captain Stacy arrives on the scene. In the devastated office, Gwen helps another model up. The huge yellow jeep of the crane swings back towards the office and smashes out the supports beneath it. The office floor gives way beneath the desks. Another piece of furniture tips out through the smashed windows. Gwen slides down the tilting floor and just manages to hang onto a telephone cable. The cable snaps but she clings onto the very edge of the floor. A blonde-haired young guy runs up behind Captain Stacy and starts taking photos. Stacy grabs the guy's camera and looks up at his daughter through the telephoto lens. Gwen's eyes widen in horror as the desk slides towards her. She releases her grip on the floor but manages to grab onto a long metal rail just below. As Spider-Man approaches swinging from building to building, the metal rail falls loose from the wall and buckles, swinging Gwen out above the streets hundreds of feet below. As Spider-Man swings and leaps towards the skyscraper, the crane's jib rips out through the building, sending huge chunks of metal towards him. Dodging the debris, Spider-Man just manages to catch Gwen, saving her from being crushed by two clashing slabs of concrete. Spider-Man swings down to the pavement with Gwen in his arms. Gwen hugs her dad. As Spider-Man swings away, Gwen gazes after him. In his office at the Daily Bugle, J. Jonah Jameson's in a meeting with a marketing guy.",
    "708": "The marketing guy slaps various slogans onto a whiteboard then smiles cockily at the grouchy newspaper editor. Jameson calms down and speaks into an intercom. Jameson looks through the window at his assistant and points to one of a dozen pill bottles. She nods. He opens it. He forces a calm face and presses the intercom. He smiles graciously at the marketing guy. Brock slips into Jameson's office. Puffing on a cigar, Jameson waves Betty away dismissively. In Times Square, a billboard displays the letters NY followed by a heart and a picture of Spider-Man. A silver-head man comes up alongside him. Peter ponders. With a friendly smile, the man goes. Later, Harry's doddery old man servant, Bernard, embraces his young master. Peter hands Harry an old basketball. Peter steals the ball of Harry and bounces it back to him in the lavishly-furnished hallway. Grabbing the ball of Harry, Peter turns into Norman's study and stares at the chaise longue and remembers laying Norman's dead body on it. Harry looks at his father's portrait. Peter tosses the ball to Harry and knocks a vase over. Harry nimbly catches the vase in one hand and the ball in the other. Peter looks concerned. Mary Jane strides into the theater where she's working. She comes through to the auditorium and her step falters. Another actress is going through her moves on stage. The actress spots Mary Jane at the back of the auditorium. Sitting in a sea of empty seats, the producer and director followed the actress's awkward gaze. The director puts on a fake smile. The producer looks unconvinced by his own suggestion. Mary Jane's blue eyes well up and she turns and walks away. The artistic duo return to their seats. Outside the theater, a crowd has gathered. Mary Jane's glum expression melts away. She smiles as they applaud. Her smile quickly fades as she realizes the crowd is not for her. She looks up at Spider-Man swinging by with barely fail resentment. She hurries through the crowd as her name is covered up on the theater front with the name of Andrea Rubin. Peter is standing amidst the delirious crowd, smiling to himself, drinking in the adulation. A marching band cuts through the workers waving placards and balloons. Brock approaches Gwen in the throng. Peter snaps Mary Jane. She forces a cheery smile as he walks off. The smile drops as she watches him disappear into the crowd. Elsewhere, stoney-faced Flint is lumbering along the street. He tilts his head. Some grains of sand seep out of his ear. He brushes them off his shoulder as he passes through cops. The cops raced to the front and back of a large tarpaulin-covered lorry.",
    "710": "He hits wreckage and glides off it as if it were a ramp. He lands on top of the van, hitting Flint with a volley of wet balls. Flint punches Spider-Man off the roof. Spider-Man clings on, but Flint punches him into the truck. The van's heading for a collision and Spider-Man pulls the guards out. He fires a thread out of the back of the van. It flints and crashes into a parked truck. Flint watches from the edge of a building above as Spider-Man staggers out of the red van, looking around frantically. As Flint moves off, the rescued guards dropped from a web spun across the street. Spider-Man wheezes up to the ledge of a building, pulls off his mask, and shakes sand from his hair. He pulls off his left boot and shakes out some more sand. Later in the evening, Peter dressed smartly in a sober suit, his dark hair swept across in a neat side parting, stops a few feet away from the entrance of the restaurant constellation and pulls Aunt May's ring out of his breast pocket. Looking agitated, Mary Jane strides up alongside a newsstand. She storms off with a face like thunder. Inside the restaurant, Peter takes in the opulent splendor as diners and waiters flip past him. He walks across the reception area. He's being summoned by a maitre d' with a pencil and a stash who's behind a small counter. The maitre d' has brought a pen on a silver platter. The maitre d's dark beady eyes look firmly at Peter. The maitre d' puts on specs to examine it. Peter hands him a note. The maitre d' clenches his fist. He leads Peter to a table. The maitre d' scurries away. Peter snaps out of his role play and sees Mary Jane coming towards him in a little black dress. He shows her to her seat and chivalrously pulls out her chair for her. He spots simpering blonde Gwen waving at him. He waves back. The maitre d' summons the champagne. Peter hurriedly shakes his head. The maitre d' waves the waiters away. Gwen waves at Peter as she walks away. Peter waves back. The maitre d' takes this as the signal. The helpless waiters are called off again as Peter shakes his head. The maitre d' bringing the champagne glasses passes Mary Jane as she storms out. Peter stares after Mary Jane in shock as the maitre d' sets the glasses down on the table and the waiter brings a champagne bucket. As a violinist serenades him, Peter picks up Mary Jane's glass and fishes the ring out of it with a fork. He dries the ring with a napkin.",
    "713": "Jack points toward the settee. Rose steps to the settee, then stretches out on it. Rose drapes one arm along the back of the settee. Rose lays her hand on the pillow behind her head. She places her right hand near her temple. Smiling, Rose lowers her head. Rose licks her lips. Jack peers over the top of his sketchpad, then draws a line. Looking from the paper to Rose, he sketches. Jack grins as he draws. He runs his charcoal across the paper creating faint arcs. He jerks his head to toss his hair out of his eyes. He adds details as he fleshes out the sketch. Jack smiles as he darkens a shadow under Rose's breasts. Rose gazes at Jack as he draws. With his finger, rubs various parts of the charcoal drawing, Rose's hand, forehead and face. Rose stares expressionless. Gradually, wrinkles form around her eyes, and she transforms into her older self. The crew members and Rose's granddaughter, Lizzie, stare at her. Brock and Lizzie exchange smiles. Jack signs and dates the drawing, then blows on it. He closes his sketchbook and hands it to Rose. They kiss. Later, Rose writes on a sheet of paper. Jack steps up to her. She hands him the case holding the Heart of the Ocean. Jack walks into the next room and slides the case into the safe. In the first class smoking room, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands. The Titanic moves slowly. On the bridge, the helmsman turns the ship's wheel as a ship's officer steps up to Captain Smith. Captain Smith looks down as he stirs a slice of lemon in his tea. The captain walks off. Stepping back into Rose's suite, he blows on his hands. Wearing an evening dress, Rose joins him. Rose grabs Jack. She pulls him through the sitting room toward a door. Lovejoy steps into the suite. Rose and Jack hurry into Rose's bedroom. Rose closes the door. Lovejoy strides through the sitting room. Jack and Rose step through another door into a corridor. Lovejoy bursts into another room. Jack and Rose hurry down the corridor. Lovejoy opens a door and glimpses Jack and Rose, who walk faster. Lovejoy follows them. Jack and Rose run to an elevator. They dash into the elevator. The operator slides the grate shut. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator and slams his hands against the grate. As the elevator descends, Lovejoy glares through glass at them. Rose raises her middle finger, then waves. Lovejoy hurries to the staircase. The elevator opens, and Rose and Jack spill out. Lovejoy runs down a staircase as Jack and Rose scramble from the bottom of a different staircase. Jack bumps onto a food table.",
    "714": "He and Rose run through swinging doors into a white corridor, then stop. Lovejoy runs up to the elevator, then scans the area around himself. Lovejoy peers in a door's round window. Rose rush down the corridor. They turn a corner and stop at a closed door. Jack opens a different door. They step inside as Lovejoy turns the corner and tries to open the door. Inside, Rose holds her hands to her ears. Jack peers down a ladder at rising smoke. In the boiler room, men shovel coal into the furnaces. Near them, Jack helps Rose down the ladder. Jack and Rose run through the smoky boiler room, past men shoveling coal. One man turns to watch them run past. Rose and Jack run through drifting smoke. A metal door opens. Jack and Rose step through it and into the cargo hold. They look around themselves as they walk past crates and stacks of boxes. Leading Rose by the hand, Jack hurries around a stack of crates, then stops at a gleaming black car. He lets go of Rose's hand, then peers inside the car. Jack steps around Rose to the passenger door. He holds out his hand and opens the door. Rose takes his hand and steps up into the passenger compartment. Jack shuts the door. As Rose glances around herself, Jack steps into the open-sided driver's seat. Rose pulls down a glass partition. Rose reaches over Jack's shoulders, then pulls him into the passenger compartment. Sitting on the seat, Jack puts his arm around Rose. They gaze into each other's eyes as they interlock their fingers. Rose lays her head on Jack's shoulder, then kisses his fingertips. She places Jack's hand on her breast. They kiss. The Titanic leaves a long wake in the dark ocean. In the metal crow's nest, attached to a mast. Murdoch, with his collar up, peers over the railing outside the wheelhouse. In the backseat of the car, Rose slaps her hand against the back window, then slowly slides it downward. Naked and his face dripping with sweat, Jack lies on top of Rose. He breathes heavily as they gaze at each other. They kiss. Rose strokes Jack's hair, then kisses his forehead. He lays his head on her chest. Two stewards with flashlights step down a short corridor and into the cargo hold. Cal opens the safe. He pulls out a note and Jack's portfolio. Lovejoy approaches. Cal opens the portfolio and studies the drawing of Rose. He reads the note. Cal's forehead tenses as he closes, then opens his eyes. He glances at the note again. In the hold, the two stewards creep toward the car. One steward shines his flashlight in the car's steamed-up windows.",
    "715": "He snaps his fingers and points to the car, then yanks open the car door, revealing empty seats. Smiling, Rose and Jack run onto the forward well deck. Rose places her hand on Jack's lips and gazes at him. They kiss. Standing at the bridge rail, Murdoch glances down at them, smiles, and walks off. Watching from the crow's nest, another man, Fleet, looks down and taps his comrade, Lee, on the arm. They stare down at Jack and Rose. The men turn and gaze past the ship. Their eyes widen as a large iceberg looms, straight ahead. Fleet rings the lookout bell three times and grabs a telephone, which rings on the bridge. The quartermaster at the wheel glances back at the phone. Officer Moody steps onto the bridge and answers the phone. Moody hangs up and turns to Murdoch as he runs to the bridge door. Quartermaster Hichens turns the wheel to the left. Murdoch rushes over to the engine room telegraph and shifts the handle to full speed astern. Hichens turns the wheel quickly. In the engine room, the chief engineer spots the telegraph shift and drops a pot of steaming soup. Turns the wheel until it stops. Murdoch hurries to the bridge rail and peers at the iceberg. In the engine room, an engineer yells. Other engineers scurry around. A red warning light flashes. Engineers slam the furnace dampers shut. Underwater, the ship's main propeller slows. An engineer pulls down a thick lever. All the propellers stop. An officer pushes an engineer out of the way and turns a wheel quickly to the right. The propellers spin in the opposite direction. In the crow's nest, the men stare at the iceberg as the ship heads straight toward it. Murdoch stares at the iceberg. Nearing the iceberg, the ship veers slowly to the left. The ship's propellers turn and reverse. Sweat trickles down Murdoch's temples. The ship's bow shifts to the left of the iceberg. At the bow railing, a man runs toward it. The ship scrapes along the side of the ice. Jack and Rose stop kissing as the ship trembles. On the bridge deck, Murdoch glances down at his hands, resting on the shaking rail. Above, Fleet holds onto the rim of the crow's nest, while Lee sits on the floor. In the bridge, Hichens keeps the wheel turned hard left. Below deck, Fabrizio sits up in his bunk. In the cargo hold, water shoots through a long tear in the hull. In the cabin, Andrews sits at his desk. He glances up at the trembling crystal chandelier above. In the crow's nest, Fleet and Lee gaze at the iceberg. On the bridge, Hichens turns the wheel to the right.",
    "717": "The steward removes Jack's coat, while the master-at-arms frisks him. The steward pulls the necklace from the pocket. Cal takes the necklace. Cal walks past Rose. The master-at-arms handcuffs Jack. Lovejoy passes the coat to the master-at-arms. The master-at-arms carts Jack away. In the chartroom, Andrews unrolls the ship's blueprint. Andrews, Smith, and others study the blueprint. Andrews stares at the blueprint, then turns to Smith. Smith glances away with his brow furrowed. Murdoch swallows hard. A ship officer enters and stands in a doorway. Smith turns toward Ismay. Alone in the sitting room, Cal walks toward Rose. She blinks, then gazes at him. Cal stares at her and opens his mouth, as if to speak, then slaps her face. He grabs her. The steward enters. Cal releases Rose. The steward fetches two life belts. Stewards open the cabin doors in third class. Smith writes coordinates. He hands the message to dark-haired Jack Phillips. Smith takes off his hat and glances at the door. Slack-jawed, Phillips stares at Smith. Smith puts his hat back on and walks out. Phillips and Bride, a young brown-haired man, exchange glances. Phillips puts on a headset and sends a telegraph. On the boat deck, officers supervise and swing them out over the water. Chief Officer Wilde stands at lifeboat four. Wilde yells to a man on an upper deck. Andrews enters the A deck foyer, where dozens of passengers chat and drink as musicians play. A waiter approaches Andrews with drinks on a tray. Nearby, Molly Brown stops a brown-haired steward. Molly passes Cal, Rose, and Ruth. Ruth turns to her two maids. The maids leave. Rose stops Andrews as he wanders past. Andrews pulls Rose aside. Cal stands nearby. Cal leans forward. Andrews nods and walks off. Meanwhile, in his office, the master-at-arms handcuffs Jack to a vertical water pipe. Lovejoy stands nearby. A dark-haired crewman rushes in. Lovejoy pulls out a handgun. As he leaves with the crewman, the master-at-arms hands Lovejoy the handcuff key. Jack and Lovejoy stare at each other as Lovejoy sits in a desk chair. On the bridge, Bride runs up to Smith. Lightoller, a man with short, light brown hair, and Murdoch hurry over to Smith. Lightoller glances at Murdoch and rushes to passengers. Band-leader Wallace Hartley leads the band onto the boat deck. The band plays. In steerage, a steward hands out life belts to third-class passengers. Fabrizio follows Tommy, who grabs a life belt and puts it on. They stand behind a crowd of passengers on the stairs leading to the main deck. At the top of the stairs, a steward stands behind a locked gate. A young brown-haired boy turns to his auburn-haired mother.",
    "718": "The mother glances at her young daughter, who nods. The two stewards exchange glances. Murdoch directs sailors lowering lifeboats filled with women and children. As one of the lifeboats tilts to one side, the passengers on board grimace. The sailors level the boat and lower it toward the water. A crewman fires a flare into the night sky. The passengers on deck, including Rose and Cal, gaze up. A young blond girl watches the flares and smiles. The flare explodes into separate fiery streams that fall. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack looks out through a porthole at the water, which almost reaches the middle of the glass. Sitting near Jack, Lovejoy places a bullet on a table and shoves the clip into the handgun. Lovejoy stands. He punches Jack in the stomach. Jack winces. Lovejoy picks up the handcuff key from the table, places it in his breast pocket, and leaves. Molly Brown helps a brunette woman. Cal smiles at Lightoller. Rose watches a tearful woman hug her husband. Ruth scans the passengers on the lifeboat. Ruth turns to Rose and smiles. Rose glares at Cal. Molly stands in the lifeboat. Molly helps Ruth into the boat. Rose's jaw slackens as she stares at Cal. Cal places Rose's life belt in the boat. Ruth and Molly reach toward Rose. Cal gestures. Rose walks away. Cal follows and grabs her. As she steps away, Cal grabs Rose and spins her toward him. Rose spits in Cal's face and runs off. The crewmen lower the lifeboat. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack peers at the water covering the porthole window. He bangs his handcuffs against the water pipe. Water floods a staircase and streams down a long corridor leading to the office. In the first-class corridor, Rose searches for Andrews. In another corridor, Andrews stops a steward and turns to a brunette woman, a blond maid. Andrews checks a passenger cabin. Rose runs to him. Andrews shakes his head. In the master-at-arms' office, Jack drops his head. Water streams in under the door. Jack climbs up the water pipe near the ceiling and bangs the handcuffs against the pipe. Elsewhere, Rose bumps into a steward as she runs to an elevator. As she reaches the elevator, an elevator operator with dark blond hair stops her. Rose shoves the operator into the elevator. The operator pushes a lever down as Rose closes the door. In the office, Jack tries to pull off the handcuffs. In the elevator, Rose's chest heaves. The elevator descends into rising water, which pours into the elevator. Rose opens the elevator doors and steps into a flood corridor. The operator pulls the lever up. Water empties out of the elevator as it rises.",
    "720": "Rose grips the axe handle with both hands. She moves her hands apart. Rose swings the ax and hits the cabinet door, missing the first mark by several inches. She approaches Jack. Jack stretches the chain across the pipe and closes his eyes. Rose closes her eyes, swings, and cuts the handcuff chain in half. Jack lifts his hands and smiles. They move into the corridor. Rose points to the flooded stairway. Jack pulls her toward the opposite end of the corridor. Rose follows Jack, who uses the axe to break through the door and into the corridor. A steward addresses them. The steward follows Jack and Rose. Jack and Rose glance back. The steward stops in his tracks. Jack and Rose reach the bottom of the third-class stairs. Atop the stairs, Tommy grips the gate and glares at the armed steward. Tommy glowers and points at the steward, then runs downstairs. Fabrizio rushes over. Jack hugs him. Jack and the others run along a crowded corridor. Jack leads them down another corridor. They pass a mustached man flipping through a book and studying a sign on the wall. Outside, passengers paddle two lifeboats away from the Titanic. In one lifeboat, Molly and Ruth stare at the ship, now tilted forward with its bow nearly submerged. A flare shoots up from the bridge deck and explodes. On the boat deck, passengers crowd around the remaining lifeboats. As Lightoller seats people in the lifeboat, one woman toting luggage tries to climb aboard. Lightoller pulls a sobbing gray-haired woman away from her husband. Lightoller puts her in the boat. Lightoller picks up a woman and places her in a boat. Andrews rushes over. Lightoller gazes out at several partially filled lifeboats moving away from the Titanic and motions to waiting passengers. Several full lifeboats are lowered to the water. Fabrizio and other passengers pop open the third-class gangway door and peer out along the ship. Two seamen pull the passengers back in and close the door. Tommy and others stand at the locked gate atop the third-class stairwell. Two stewards unlock the gate. A woman and several men rush through the open gate. The stewards push back the men, punch them, and hit them with axe handles. One steward pulls out a small handgun and points it at the crowd now contained behind the closed gate. In the suite, Cal removes the heart of the ocean, along with some cash, from the safe and puts it in his jacket pocket. He glances at Lovejoy. Lovejoy opens his jacket, revealing a handgun in a shoulder holster. Cal closes the safe, locks it, and walks out. An auburn-haired woman cries and kisses a brown-haired man. Cal turns toward Lovejoy as he approaches.",
    "721": "Jack leads Rose and his friends down another corridor and up a stairway to another locked gate. At the top, a steward addresses a small crowd from behind the locked gate. Jack grabs the gate and shakes it. Jack rushes over and pulls on a wooden bench nailed to the floor. Fabrizio and Tommy help Jack pull up the bench. They charge forward and ram the gate. They ram the gate again. Jack, Rose, and other passengers pass the steward. Tommy punches the steward. On the boat deck, passengers swarm around the remaining lifeboats. Lightoller pushes away a group of men. A man knocks a woman off the deck. He grabs onto the side of the lifeboat and dangles high above. A sailor pulls the woman on deck. Lightoller lifts a revolver. He waves the gun at the group of men. He turns toward a young sailor. Lightoller loads his revolver, while Lowe boards the lifeboat. On the other side of the ship, Cal and Lovejoy peer down as Murdoch supervises the lowering of a lifeboat. Cal and Lovejoy peer down the side of the ship. Below, one lifeboat is lowered onto another lifeboat sitting in the water but unable to detach. In the lower lifeboat, a man labors to cut the ropes connecting the two boats. On the other side of the ship, Lowe stands in a lifeboat as it is lowered. He waves his revolver at men on the decks as they try to jump into the boat. Cal and Lovejoy turn as Lowe fires his gun in the air. Cal follows Murdoch toward the bow. Meanwhile, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy arrive on the upper deck. They run to the side of the ship. Jack stands up on the railing and gazes toward the bow. As he steps down, Rose stops the mustached Colonel Gracie. Jack, Rose, and the others run toward the bow. Meanwhile, as the band plays on deck, a passenger bumps into one of the violinists. Hartley's brow furrows. As the band resumes playing, Jack, Rose, Fabrizio, and Tommy run past. Elsewhere, Murdoch and several seamen load a small boat. Murdoch glances around, then turns to a sailor. Cal slips money into Murdoch's pocket. Murdoch glances down at the cash, then exchanges looks with Cal and walks off. On the port side, Lightoller loads passengers into a boat. Lightoller shoots into the sky. In the crowd, Jack turns to Tommy. Tommy moves off through the crowd. Meanwhile, Lovejoy approaches Cal, who stands beside the small boat, called a collapsible. Cal glances away. Murdoch turns to Cal and Lovejoy, while Ismay helps load the collapsible. Cal stares at the collapsible, then blinks. Cal turns and walks off.",
    "726": "A viola player glances back, then returns and joins him. The bass player carries his bass back, then stands on the other side of Hartley. The cello player also returns. Captain Smith stares across the wheelhouse. He gazes through a window at the rising water, then places one hand on the helm. Water pours in beneath the door. In the smoking room, Andrews holds his pocket watch as the glass slides off the mantel. He opens the clock on the mantel and adjusts the time. He shuts the clock, then leans against the mantel, gazing downward. An elderly couple lies in bed as water streams beneath them. The man kisses the woman. A red-haired woman leans over two young children lying in a bed. The children sleep. Elsewhere, a Degas painting of a woman wearing a long tutu floats beneath water. On deck, people run past the band. People scramble about. Fabrizio unties the lifebelt on Tommy's body. People rush away from the rising water. The girl in Cal's arms looks around herself, wide-eyed. People work to right the overturned lifeboat. One sailor slides down a rope. Fabrizio puts on the lifebelt as water surges around him. Water rushes over the listing ship, causing some people to fall into the water. Fabrizio opens the knife and Cal backs away from the rushing water. Fabrizio and others tried to cut the ropes. Inside, people slip and fall near the Grand Staircase. Guggenheim, wearing a top hat and formal wear, sits in a chair, watching with wide eyes. Outside, people fall into the water others run up the deck from the approaching water. In the wheelhouse, Smith stares wide-eyed as water covers the glass windows. Outside, on one of the decks, passengers wade through waist-deep water toward the lifeboat in the middle of the ship. Fabrizio slices through the rope with his pocket knife, partially freeing the boat, but causing it to tip onto its side. Cal climbs onto the high side of the capsizing lifeboat. Railings will pull themselves onto pieces of floating debris. Several people run toward the backend of the Titanic, which is now tilted up at a slight angle. Some passengers hang from ropes or leap into the icy sea. Jack and Rose make their way to a railing near the rear of the ship and turned back. Jack grabs Rose's hand and runs through the crowd. They made their way to the crowd. Water swamps the base of the first funnel as it sinks below the ocean's surface. Inside the ship, sea water floods the grand staircase. Passengers and crew grab onto anything they can as the water rises. Jack climbs over a railing and helps Rose climb over.",
    "732": "Rose gulps as she stares at the comb. Brock kneels beside her. Rose nods. Later, a computer animation of the Titanic striking an iceberg. Lizzie stands behind her grandmother as Rose climbs out of her wheelchair. The crew watches Rose as she shuffles to a video monitor displaying footage of the Titanic wreck. Rose blinks and inhales sharply as the door with the ornate, leaded glass window comes into view. In a flashback, two men wearing tuxedos smile and nod as they open a pair of doors with leaded glass windows. On the video monitor, grayish growth covers the window's ornate scrollwork. Rose places her hands over her mouth. Rose turns away from the monitor and returns to her wheelchair. Brock switches on a tape recorder as he sits across from Rose. Brock grins, then nods. On a video monitor behind Rose, the corroded Titanic wreck transforms into a gleaming ocean liner moored alongside a dock. Passengers walk up one of three gangplanks. Men and women toting suitcases make their way to the Titanic. A crane loads an antique car onto the ship. Sitting in her father's arms, a young brunette girl watches a fleet of gleaming automobiles arrive. A chauffeur wearing a tweed uniform and black leather gloves steps out of the driver's seat and opens the car's back door. He takes a woman's gloved hand as she steps out of the car. The brown haired woman, who wears a white dress with thin black stripes and a large brimmed hat, gazes up at the enormous ship. A black haired man wearing a bowler hat and grey suit steps out behind her. The man hands over money. The man checks his pocket watch then steps to Rose and her mother. Rose follows her fiancee, Cal Hockley, through the crowd. A health inspector runs a comb through a man's dark hair and beard. Ruth strides ahead of Rose and Cal as they walk up a gangplank. Inside a saloon with a view of the Titanic men smoke and drink as they play a game of cards. A brown haired card player turns to a man beside him. Blonde Jack deals Sven another card and then exchanges one of his own for a card from the deck. Eyes narrowed, Jack smokes a cigarette as he peers across the table to Sven's partner. Several silver coins, a pocketknife, a pocket watch, and a pair of third class tickets for the Titanic rest in the middle of the table. A black haired man raps his knuckles on the table. Sven lays down his cards. Fabrizio snatches the tickets and dances. As Jack sweeps up the coins, Olaf grabs his collar. Jack closes his eyes as Olaf makes a fist but Olaf punches Sven instead.",
    "736": "Rose leans forward and spits. Rose's mother and her friends stroll nearby. As Ruth steps up, Rose taps Jack's arm. He turns around and swallows. Rose steps towards her mother then glances at Jack. Smiling at Jack, Molly points to her own chin. Jack quickly wipes saliva off his own chin. Jack waves as Rose and her mother walk off. Jack lifts his hands and shrugs. Elsewhere, Molly helps Jack into a black tuxedo jacket. Molly and Jack gaze into a full-length mirror. At dusk, the Titanic trails black smoke from its four smoke stacks, the funnels, as it sails toward the setting sun. Later, a steward opens a door for Jack. Wearing a white tie and shirt, Jack smiles at the steward as he steps inside. He pauses, then walks toward an ornate railing and columns beneath the dome skylight. Jack steps to the railing and gazes down at a couple descending the ship's grand staircase. Jack glances up at the skylight and walks down the staircase to the landing where he studies a wall clock with an elaborately carved wooden casing. Jack descends past a winged statue. Couples wearing forming evening wear stroll or stand about chatting. Jack leans against a column, then glances at a bearded man standing erect with his left arm behind his back. Jack stands up straight and places his own arm behind his back. Jack nods to the man as he and a woman stroll past. Jack watches the couple, then gazes up the staircase as Cal and Ruth descend toward him. Cal eyes Jack as they stepped past him. From the staircase's landing, Rose gazes down at Jack who pretends to shake somebody's hand, practicing to be a gentleman. He turns and looks up at Rose who wears a floor length black lace dress. She smiles and descends the stairs toward him. Rose stops a few steps above Jack who takes her white gloved hand and kisses it. Jack holds out his bent right arm for Rose who takes it. She smiles as he tilts back his chin, nose in the air. Arm-in-arm, they stroll up to Cal. Cal and Ruth step arm-in-arm toward the reception room. Rose smiles at Jack as they follow. Later Rose and Jack descend another wide, curving staircase. A dark haired woman speaking with a white-haired man. They gaze toward a group of people. Molly takes Jack's other arm. Rose, Jack, and Molly step into the large dining room. Mustached Astor returns. Jack and Rose stroll through the dining room. They stop at their table. Jack waves his hand. Rose gestures across the table at Jack to put his napkin in his lap. Jack gazes down at an array of silverware placed on both sides of the charter holding his plate.",
    "738": "A bearded man knocks into Jack and spills his beer on Rose. Bjorn slammed Thomas' fist to the tabletop. Rose pulls Tommy's cigarette from his mouth. Rose puffs on it. She blows out smoke and hands Jack the hem of her skirt. As Jack holds onto her dress, Rose slowly lifts her heels and rises onto her toes. Jack gazes down as Rose stands on her tiptoes and collapses into Jack's arms. Cal's manservant, Lovejoy, descends halfway down the staircase and peers around the room. He spies Jack holding Rose in his arms. The couples hold hands as they dance in a line through the crowded room. Fabrizio grabs Rose's hand and she grabs Jack. The line of dancers snake through the clapping drinking crowd. The next day, Rose and Cal eat breakfast at a table in the private promenade. Cal shakes his head. As Rose stirs her coffee, she and Cal exchange glances. Cal stands and flips over their dining table. Cal walks away. As he steps through the doorway, an aproned woman rushes over to Rose, then bends and picks up dishes. Rose crouches to help. Rose lays her hand on dark haired Trudy's shoulder and sinks against her chair. Later in Rose's room, Trudy laces up the back of Rose's corset. Ruth steps in. Trudy curtsies and steps out. Ruth walks to Rose and ties the laces of her corset. Turning her head, Ruth covers her mouth. She closes her eyes, exhales, and drops her hand. Ruth turns back to Rose. Ruth gazes at Rose, then reaches out her hands. Gently cradling Rose's face, Ruth kisses her cheek. She turns Rose back around, then continues lacing the corset. Rose grimaces as Ruth tightens the laces. In the dining room, a man plays piano as first class passengers, holding sheet music, sing. Rose stands between Cal and her mother. Jack descends the grand staircase. One hand in his pocket, Jack strolls toward the dining room where two stewards stand outside its doors. One steward wearing a dark suit steps in front of Jack. Inside, Lovejoy steps toward the door. Lovejoy emerges. Lovejoy hands the money to the steward. The two stewards escort Jack away. On the bridge, a crewman steps up to the captain. Captain Smith reads a note, then smiles at Ruth. Outside, Jack climbs a railing, then hops onto a deck where a boy wearing a cap winds a string around a top. The boy spins the top on the deck. Jack steps toward another railing, pauses, and picks up a black bowler hat and long coat from a chair. Donning the hat, Jack wets his fingers and plasters down his hair. Wearing the hat and coat, Jack grabs Rose's arm.",
    "74": "We approach a riverside village. Centering on open touring car, as it drives along a river road. We stoop low towards the car. He is the driver of the car. Pleasant river landscapes flow behind him. He is dressed in dark clothes, a paper collar, a string tie. As he drives he talks to himself. He nods, smiles, and touches his hat. A widow with a little wad of bills hidden away in the sugar-bowl. He shifts into second gear, climbing a steep little hill. The stones of a country graveyard gleam in the last daylight. He starts fast and noisily down a steep hill. She is hard at work, to music o.s. Among the members of the sad burlesque audience, he is in strong contrast: a sour and aggressive expression. We move in fast to a head close-up. Labeled H-A-T-E in tattoo across four knuckles, it grips and flexes. Before we see the lettering he slides it into his pocket. His head slants; a cold smile; one eyelid flutters. A hand descends firmly onto his shoulder. He glances up behind him as we. He bends down and speaks quietly next preacher's ear. A grim stone turretted facade; an American flag idles at top center. They sit in the grass, a sentimental picture. John is nine; Pearl is five. They are working together on Pearl's doll; Pearl is dressing her, while John gets on a difficult shoe. He proudly exhibits the shod foot. They look o.s. and get up, Pearl dangling the doll. A Model-T Ford approaches at maximal speed on uneven dirt road. The car careens towards us; then swings into the sideyard as we pan, and stops. Ben Harper half-falls out of the far door, his shoulder blood-stained, his eyes wild. A hefty, simple man of thirty. He looks at them, dazed, across the car. On this he comes around clear of the car with a revolver in one hand and a bloody roll of banknotes in the other. He moves forward and out and in his place we see two police cars, small in distance, coming fast. They move at high speed, with sirens. Ben and his children, tiny in the distance, dilate. Police cars approaching in background. Pearl hugs her doll. In b.g. the troopers get out of their cars and fan out cautiously to surround Ben: guns in hand. Ben backs away from his children, raising his hands, gun in one hand. We pull back a little, enlarging the group shot and the role of the troopers in it. Two troopers approach Ben from behind. He runs forward and clasps his stomach, with his mouth open. One trooper smacks the back of Ben's head with a pistol barrel.",
    "740": "Celia's brought a drink. Jolene runs up onto the stage. Minnie and Aibileen exchange a look. Mrs. Walters smiles gaily. Celia shimmies up behind Hilly. As Hilly try to stop her, rips her sleeve. Hilly's look of horror is followed by a patronizing smile. Celia suddenly looks pale. She weaves her way through the tables. Minnie slips away. Hilly is at the bottom of the stairs, saying goodnight to her guests. Hilly grimaces angrily as her mother parades her pie at shoulder height like a waitress. Mrs. Walters and a male guest walk off. Next morning, Celia shakes her head despairingly. Minnie moves towards her. Like a school teacher, she points Celia to a seat at the base of the bed and closes the door of the bedroom. Celia shoots Minnie an appalled sidelong glance. At her house, Aibileen and Minnie are smiling at Skeeter's manuscript. At her home, Skeeter drops her bag on the floor and walks into her mother's bedroom where Charlotte is sitting on her bed without a wig sewing a sampler. Charlotte takes off her specs and stares at her. In flashback, Charlotte poses with her medal. She winks at Constantine, who is nodding approvingly by the door. At the lunch following the medal ceremony, Constantine is serving each lady in turn, under Charlotte's rather anxious gaze. Charlotte glances towards the door and then at Constantine, who has not heard the knocking. Constantine sees her going to the door. Charlotte glances over her shoulder. Charlotte shuts the fly screen. Rachel's face falls. She barges in. The guest of honor looks appalled. Charlotte weighs up her options. Charlotte swallows hard. Rachel leads her mother away by the hand, both of them looking back at Charlotte in disbelief as they go through the door, onto the porch. Constantine turns and looks back at Charlotte through the fly screen. Charlotte's brown eyes meet her gaze for a second. Then she looks at the unforgiving faces of the Daughters of America seated at her dining table. The frail, old servant won't be moved, keeping her uncomprehending gaze directed at Charlotte. Charlotte shuts the door in her face. Constantine, in a smart, cream dress and navy hat, is packing her suitcase. She tosses a cross to the door of her bedroom. Her fingers trace the lines on the door where she had marked Skeeter and Rachel's heights as they grew. Finally arriving at the top. In the present, Skeeter sheds bitter tears. Skeeter shakes her head in numb disbelief. Charlotte, her own eyes welling, covers her mouth with her hand, seeing Skeeter's unhappiness. Skeeter drives the blue Cadillac slowly along a dirt road and peers through some trees at a single-story, white clapboard house, its roof overgrown, standing in a small clearing.",
    "742": "Skeeter looks away troubled. Her mother weighs her words carefully. Looking at her handsome, regal looking mother, Skeeter nods in acknowledgement, but then lowers her eyes. Smiling warmly, Charlotte leans in and kisses Skeeter on the forehead. Skeeter tries to smile, but is overcome by sadness. Charlotte hugs her tightly. Out in the sunshine, Minnie is strolling towards Celia's house with a bag of groceries, fanning herself in the heat. A red Chevrolet Corvette Convertible rolls into view. Minnie's eyes shift, but she doesn't quicken her pace. The car zooms right up behind her. She turns to see Johnny at the wheel. She hurries towards the house. She throws down the grocery bag and picks up a loose branch. She tosses away the branch. Johnny helps pick up the groceries. He hands her her bag. With a gentle guiding hand at her back and a good-natured smile, he walks her towards the house. In the heavily decorated dining room, Celia, in an off-the-shoulder dress, carefully places a dish of cookies into the center of the table, alongside a cooked ham, several cakes and pies, and other dishes of food. Johnny, taking off his jacket, leads the way into the dining room and stands next to his wife. Minnie looks bemused. Minnie's lips crease into a smile. Celia beams from ear-to-ear. Johnny pulls out a chair for Minnie. As Celia serves up, Minnie looks admiringly at the spread in front of her. Minnie and Aibileen, smartly dressed, hurry to church. The whole congregation stands. Looking bewildered, Aibileen joins in the clapping. Aibileen looks from smiling Pearly to smiling Minnie. He proffers her the book and she stares at it numbly. With her eyes lowered, she takes it from him. Finally, summoning up a smile, Minnie standing with the congregation lifts an approving eyebrow. Now, Aibileen beckons her to join her, and she, too, seems suddenly shy, stepping up next to her friend in front of all the people. The two women stand arm-in-arm facing the packed church. Outside her home, Skeeter leafs through the pages of signatures. Skeeter's expression is solemn. She hesitates to meet their gaze. Aibileen holds out her hand to Skeeter. Skeeter smiles and nods through her tears. Back on duty, Aibileen lets herself into Elizabeth's kitchen through the back door, her arms loaded with groceries. Hilly is with Elizabeth and her baby son. Mae Mobley runs up to Aibileen. Hilly blocks her. Elizabeth hurries out of the room with the baby. Hilly eyes Aibileen with ice-cold menace. Aibileen grabs Hilly's arm. Her lips trembling, Hilly holds Aibileen's firm gaze, then runs off into the next room. Aibileen blows out her cheeks as she tries to catch her breath.",
    "743": "Mrs. Walters watches TV as she has her lunch. Skeeter arrives. Skeeter joins the young women. She hugs Elizabeth, and now she hugs Hilly. Hilly bites her lip. The bridge is now in full swing, with Skeeter playing with Hilly, Elizabeth, and Jolene. Hilly kicks Jolene with her stilettoed foot and smiles blithely. Skeeter goes on. Skeeter lowers her eyes awkwardly. In the kitchen, Aibileen answers the phone. As platinum blonde Celia, in a yellow playsuit, rings off, her husband creeps up behind her. He nuzzles her neck and bends her backwards by the edge of their swimming pool. Mrs. Walters has dropped off in front of the TV. As Aibileen goes to take her plate, she takes another mouthful. Skeeter smiles at Aibileen, who is replenishing the ladies' glasses. Elizabeth notices Hilly squirming. Aibileen listens passively. Skeeter watches Aibileen. Aibileen has heard every word. Skeeter looks down at her lap. Later, Hilly and her friends are standing by their cars. Skeeter is inside, watching them through a window. She wanders across to Aibileen, who is clearing up. Aibileen looks across, with the same passive expression as before. Skeeter's attention is drawn to the voice on the TV. She hands Skeeter a piece of paper. Elizabeth gives her a thin, cool, smile. Skeeter pulls up outside a columned portico two-story house. With her jacket over her arm and her briefcase in the other, she walks past a black servant trimming a box hedge at the front entrance. She hurries into the hall and up a wide, wooden staircase. Mother is sitting at her dressing table in an evening dress and an elfin brown wig. Her mother, Charlotte, with a cigarette in one hand, scoots off to the bathroom, pulling off the wig, next to several wigs on stands. Grimly, she eyes her own limp and thin hair in the mirror. Skeeter slumps down on a sofa, looking annoyed. Charlotte comes out in a brown bob. She waits for Skeeter's approval. She steps out of the green dress. Skeeter scowls at her reflection. Her mother zips her up roughly. Charlotte sits Skeeter down. At dinner, Charlotte pats Carlton's hand. Robert Phelan takes a sip of bourbon. Across the table, Charlotte looks awkward. Carlton, wearing a stiff smile, glances from one parent to the other. Skeeter fixes her eyes on her mother, who is concentrating on her soup. As Skeeter storms away from the table, Phelan frowns lamely. His tall, angular wife pats him on the shoulder and leaves the room. Skeeter, striding down a pathway, stops, the sun outlining her long, ringleted hair. She gazes mournfully at a stone bench under a weeping willow tree. In her mind's eye, she sees herself as a young, teenage girl sitting morosely on the bench.",
    "744": "A petite black woman with long plaits comes towards her, passing beneath the long, wispy branches of the willow. The black woman, Constantine, smiles at her warmly as she sits down next to her. Constantine grips Skeeter by the hand, bringing a grateful smile to her face. Skeeter nods, with tears in her eyes. They walk out of the willow glade. Constantine slaps an arm around Skeeter's shoulders. Skeeter walks back the same way she came, with a more relaxed pace, a thoughtful look on her face. Later, she's on the phone. Charlotte has traced the phone flex to the kitchen. Elegant, slim Ms. Elaine Stein is still on the phone. Skeeter replaces the receiver, grinning as if she'd just won the jackpot. Hilly's on Elizabeth's back porch, with a contractor. Aibileen glances up at a windy sky. Skeeter waits for Hilly to drive away and then looks pointedly at Aibileen. She hurries in with the laundry basket. They come into Elizabeth's kitchen. Elizabeth's husband, Raleigh, sees Skeeter sitting with Aibileen. Aibileen gets up from sorting the washing. Black storm clouds release heavy rain on Jackson. At Hilly's house, Minnie is fanning Mrs. Walters with a newspaper. She and Minnie glance towards the window and the storm raging outside. Mrs. Walters sits up her in chair, in awe. Mrs. Walters fixes Minnie with a look of confused comprehension. Hilly, who has been lighting candles on the dining table, sits fanning herself. Minnie puts down the paper and sidles to the window, looking out over the terrace and the outdoor toilet beyond it. She sees a sun chair being buffeted in the wind. Minnie shifts awkwardly from foot to foot. The pool umbrella has gone the way of the chair. Minnie beats a hasty retreat. Mrs. Walters lays out some cards. Her daughter's eyes narrow as she watches Minnie disappear down the hall. In the bathroom, as Minnie softly raises the toilet lid, Hilly puts her ear to the bathroom door. Minnie, caught with her knickers down, freezes. Defiantly, Minnie flushes the toilet. Minnie stands with her arms folded, then slams down the lid. Mrs. Walters looks up from her cards without expression. Minnie, carrying her handbag, strides out of the front door, into the pouring rain. A child's bedroom turned upside down. Aibileen sits with Mae Mobley on her lap, sheltering under an upturned mattress. In Elizabeth's sprawling bungalow the next day, Aibileen, in her maid's uniform, is sitting on the toilet. Flies buzz around her. She brings a hand to her mouth, her face perspiring, her expression world-weary. Elizabeth, holding Mae Mobley's hand, stands outside the wooden toilet, on the back porch. Aibileen picks the child up. Aibileen shuts the toilet door with her free hand.",
    "745": "Elizabeth waves to Mae Mobley and drives off. The little girl strokes Aibileen's cheek. Smiling softly, Aibileen kisses her on the cheek. They hug each other fondly. At a bus stop, several maids from the locality are climbing aboard. Minnie, in a green straw hat and spotty dress and carrying a pie and a fan, peers out from the door of an empty bus. Seeing the coast is clear, she gets out. Yule Mae, standing next to Aibileen, spots her. Minnie looks nonchalant. Skeeter strides up. Aibileen glances behind her at the bus door closing. She watches it drive off with a doom-laden look on her face. A white mother pushing a pram slows down as she passes. Aibileen takes the slip of paper. Aibileen trudges off. Skeeter studies a State of Mississippi pamphlet on the conduct of non-white and other minorities. Aibileen's voice reads the words. Aibileen answers. Minnie with her pie rings Hilly's doorbell. Hilly eyes the pie and loftily indicates she should wait. Minnie's face stiffens. She sinks to the floor. Aibileen rings off. Her eyes lighting on the paper with Skeeter's number propped up on the phone. In a church young Preacher Green invites the choir to stand. Aibileen thinks on his words. Later at home Aibileen hurries to the door. She ushers Skeeter in. She invites Skeeter to follow her to the sitting room of her spotless little house. Skeeter sits down on the sofa and unties the headscarf she's wearing. Aibileen stays standing. Aibileen in a yellow dress with elbow length sleeves and a scalloped detail down the front purses her lips with a faint sigh. Visibly nervous she pours tea from a white china pot into a china cup spilling a drop on the saucer. A silver spoon on a white napkin is set next to the cup and there's also a plate of jam tarts. As Skeeter takes hold of the cup Aibileen hastily wipes up the spill in the saucer. Smoothing the back of her dress Aibileen sits on the arm of an easy chair facing Skeeter. Skeeter at the kitchen table reads from a list of questions. Aibileen looks mournfully at the photograph of the graduate student. Skeeter follows her gaze. Aibileen turns away to face the window, blanked out by the strong sun outside. Aibileen puts down the cutlery she's holding and nods mutely. Aibileen seems to be conducting an internal dialogue with herself. Skeeter carefully considers the proposal. Aibileen produces a notebook and her reading glasses. She stands in front of Skeeter with the notebook open in her hands. Cracking a brief smile, she sits back down. They stifle their giggles. Sometime later Skeeter puts her notes in her briefcase.",
    "75": "We stay on the house at leisure; we hear him lunging, shoulder to door; we begin to hear squeaking of hinges and splintering of wood. An ultra romantic image of shelter and peace. Frogs or river noises o.s., then the rattle of running footsteps. The children center, their backs to us, sprinting towards the boat. Light mist as in previous shot. We shoot over BESS'S turned photograph and over BIRDIE, close, passed out in his rocker. The children run through open door in BACKGROUND and JOHN runs up to BIRDIE. He grabs BIRDIE'S shoulder; BIRDIE half-rises, and falls face down on floor. BIRDIE rears on one elbow and looks up at him. He falls face down again. JOHN grabs BIRDIE by one ear, turning his face up. He looks up earnestly at JOHN. He masterfully takes PEARL by the hand and leads her into the night. We shoot from the river. They struggle through the sumac and pokeberry weeds at edge of river, towards skiff, whose prow, tethered to willow, we see throughout this un-moving shot, at our extreme right. When they come opposite skiff -- which is a few yards out from shore. PEARL, frankly bored, dangling her doll, is yawning. JOHN, as he finishes undoing rope from a willow root, looks up and around, checking on pursuit. On the bank above, it is huge in the mist. A man is going along a river lane on horseback. It is PREACHER; he walks the horse away from us. We descend to a poor riverside farmhouse; JOHN and PEARL tether a boat in front of it. They are eating hot boiled potatoes. A glance at JOHN and PEARL, and they turn away towards lane in BACKGROUND. JOHN and PEARL proceed towards the house. We shoot from within open door of kitchen. JOHN and PEARL advance to edge of porch. A TIRED FARM WOMAN stands by door, within. We shoot OVER her. Woman leaves shot briefly (we HOLD on CHILDREN) She re-enters and goes to them with a bowl of steaming potatoes. They take hands-ful, and make to eat. They turn away and walk towards boat. She looks after them. PREACHER stands behind the flames; in FOREGROUND an OLD MAN sits profiled on a box. Other workers, all men, sit around fire. Short silence, as the other men look at PREACHER without liking. Then the old man spits into the fire. A spurt of steam as spit strikes. He comes down to water. Full landscape in BACKGROUND. We shoot OVER two sitting rabbits as they watch, their ears up. The skiff passes. PEARL plays with doll JOHN unsnarls line. The skiff passes. We PAN in a big barn near the river, then a lighted house; willows along shore.",
    "751": "People are reflected in the mirror of a shop changing room, peering in nervously. Dr. Mathison sits beside a black woman who's lying down, gazing into a blanket wrapped bundle. The women smiles at the wriggling bundle. The doctor gently lifts the bundle and looks inside. Still reflected in the mirror, the doctor looks up at the saleswoman. The doctor looks back at the baby, frowning. A man is leaning against a train window, staring out as the train pulls away from a station. The man straightens up and leans back in his seat. He's wearing a dark gray suit. The top button of his pale green shirt is undone. His tie loosely knotted. The little hair he has is close shaved, leaving just a dark shadow. Glancing between the seats in front of him, he sees a little girl lying almost upside down, staring back at him. He grins at her. The grin fades, and he leans towards the window again. He rubs the inside corner of one eye wearily. A slim women in her late 20s, wearing a blue top, stretches up to place her coat on the overhead rack. As she does, the top parts company with her black trousers, and the man gazes at her exposed white midriff and the section of ivy tattoo climbing through the gap between top and trousers. He flirtively slips off his wedding ring and drops it into his jacket pocket. The young woman sits down, glances at some leaflets, drops them in the seat pocket, straightens her shoulder-length brown hair, tucks down her top, sits back, and closes her eyes. The man looks down at the seat pocket in front of him, stretches forward, and picks up a magazine. The man picks up the second magazine, and looks at him himself before passing it to her. The man looks down, swallows, and looks at her again. He watches another train pass and looks down before turning to her again. Shake hands. She looks down at the magazine again. She looks up, her smile gone, folds and unfolds her arms, tucks her fist under her chin, shows him her wedding ring. She stands, picks up the leaflets, and moves down the aisle of the train. His head drops. He pulls his wedding ring from his pocket, hesitates for a moment before slipping it back on, and settles back in his seat. Glancing between the seat backs, David sees a little girl in front sitting up now. Her blonde hair pulled off her face and held by yellow clips watching him and smiling. He moves out of her sight towards the window and leans against it frowning slightly. His eyes close. Outside, trees and shrubs form a green backdrop along the track side.",
    "755": "He looks across the room, past the bed, to a second door. He stands in the doorway of a bathroom, where a boy and girl, not quite teenagers, are sitting on the floor facing each other, their wrists tied above their heads. He kneels beside the boy pulling the plastic cable tying his wrists to a towel rail, light glinting on his wedding ring. The cable falls free, and he crosses, still on his knees, to the girl, and repeats the operation, glancing over his shoulder to the open door behind him. He silences the pair, hand out, palm down. In another larger bedroom, plain white linen curtains flap at the open window, giving glimpses of a pair of bare legs stretched out on the carpet. The curtains flap further apart, revealing a woman in a dressing gown, sitting on the floor, and leaning against an old fashioned black radiator. Her knees are drawn up. The gown has slipped partway up her legs. Her wrists are tied above her head and lashed to the radiator. Her head lulls on one side. From the other side of the room, David looks down at her and puts a finger to his lips. He crosses to the full length window and parts the curtains. After a moment, he steps through the curtains onto a balcony and walks to the edge, raindrops glistening on his rain cape. He leans on the rail and looks over. The maintenance man in orange launches himself at David from inside the bedroom. David is hurled over the balcony. He lands on his face in water. He lifts his head. The black shiny surface on which he's lying begins to crease and sag. Water forms an ever larger pool around him. He watches the rain splashing in the water in front of him as he gradually begins to sink. Over to his left, he sees a crumpled ridge of plastic sheeting begin to fold in on itself. More ridges ahead and to his right do the same. Behind him, as the sheeting slips inwards, he sees a glistening white surface beneath it. From above, the black plastic swimming pool cover enfolds him, wraps him up, and sinks into the dark water. Beneath the surface, blackness gives way to light from above, seen through a haze of bubbles, before the blackness closes around him again. His hands thrash in the bubbles reaching for the light. High above the water, a blurred shape in orange turns away from the balcony. Darkness and light alternate under the water as David struggles to free himself from the embrace of the black cover. Through the bubbles, a pole appears, poking down from a blurred figure at the pool side.",
    "757": "Her eyes follow him around the room. Her head turns to him as he gets into bed beside her. She looks into his eyes for a moment as he lays his head on her shoulder, before she turns back, and gazes out beyond the foot of the bed. Her eyes close. Audrey opens her eyes again as David closes his, and his face relaxes. Joseph, in a green T-shirt with white and gold bands around the middle, walks downstairs and into the kitchen. Audrey and David are at the table, leaning towards each other, holding hands. They look around at him, smiling. David picks up the paper and Audrey goes to the cooker. She's wearing a white T-shirt and green and white striped pajama bottoms. Joseph sits at the table, looking up at her cautiously. David continues to read the paper. She turns from the cooker. David continues to read, at last looking up and nodding. Joseph unscrews the cap of a big carton of orange juice and carefully pours himself half a glass full. He replaces the cap and stands to remove the carton from the table. He sits again, staring at the glass. The paper slides surreptitiously across the table to him. Joseph looks up at his father, who almost imperceptibly nods down at the story. Joseph pulls the paper to him and reads. Beside the headline is a black and white drawing of the heroic figure in a cape, with a particularly prominent square jaw. Joseph gazes down at the paper, his lips moving slightly. He looks up at David, mouth open. David nods expressionlessly. Joseph closes his mouth, swallows, and blinks hard. David puts a finger to his lips, and Joseph nods and wipes away a tear. David glances down, then looks up and gives Joseph a smile. At the Limited Edition Gallery, a bored security man looks at a picture, and a waitress carries a tray of food amongst the smartly dressed guests. Elijah is talking to a couple from his wheelchair. David wanders in wearing a casual brown jacket and open-neck shirt, glances around him, and stops in front of a picture. A black woman with gray hair approaches him, looks across the busy gallery. David looks across the busy gallery. Elijah's wheeling his chair from the gallery down the narrow corridor lined with comics. David is following. Elijah freewheels down a ramp into his office and swings the chair around to face David. He's wearing a tight black leather zip-up jacket with short glittering blue lapels. He reaches to a shelf behind him and picks up a paper. He looks at it and turns it round, showing David the drawing of the hero in the cape.",
    "759": "David's sitting alone at the table in a small dimly lit kitchen. He's staring down at the spoon he's holding against the rim of a cereal bowl. He nods slightly as he brings the spoon under control. He walks down the hall past an open doorway and starts to go upstairs. From inside the room, his wife looks up at him. He stops and looks down at her. She's standing in front of open drawer. She drops her eyes momentarily, looks up again, gently. He continues upstairs. David, in a gray jacket, walks past a large sign reading Memorial Service for the families of East Rail Train 177. In the church, a priest stands in the pulpit. By the pulpit, photos cover a large board. Outside the church, David heads towards his car. He stops and looks at the windscreen, walks to it, and takes an envelope from under the windscreen wiper. He turns the envelope over, frowning, before flicking open the unsealed flap. He stands looking at the card for some moments before turning and gazing back at the church. In a locker room, David opens one of the chipped green doors. He stops in the doorway of an office and takes off his baseball cap. A gray haired woman with gold rimmed glasses is sitting at a computer. She glances at her computer screen. She picks up a pen. She makes a note and puts down the pen, still without looking at him. She returns to her work, still ignoring him. He pulls on his baseball cap and goes. A cape hooded figure stands motionless in an archway silhouetted black against the teeming rain. He's watching an american football training session. One player suddenly erupts into a sprint, sidestepping opponents without losing speed. He captures the ball thrown from behind and dives over the line. He tosses the ball to another player and trots back again. Protected from the rain by the hood of his cape, David sighs deeply. In the locker room, David towels his head and face. He puts his towel away and glances to his right. An older man is in the doorway. David stares at the locker door, and then glances at Noel. In a darkened room, a hand reaches out and switches on a bedside lamp. David, head on a pillow, looks sideways at his son who's sleeping peacefully. A clock on the other side of the bed says a quarter to one. David stands at his wife's closed door. Audrey frowns and shakes her head. From blackout, a fuzzy grayness takes the shape of a sling holding the arm of a black boy. He's sitting in a strangely hazy living room, a photo on the wall behind, a corner table with a lamp on it.",
    "760": "The boy's mouth turns down, and he sulks silently, staring blankly ahead. Behind him the door opens, and a woman enters. She pauses, hands on hips, then walks towards him. They are both reflected in the curved screen of an old TV, so the edges of the room look distorted. She stands beside him, arms folded. The woman crouches beside the boy, looking into his face. The boy turns and looks at her. She stands and folds her arms again. He's hunched forward, head down. The boy lifts his head. The boy goes to the window. Outside in the sunshine, children are playing in a park with a high chain link fence. An oblong box with purple wrapping is propped on the seat of a bench facing him. Children chase past the bench, as the boy walks slowly towards it. Holding on to the fencing for support as he negotiates the two steps down into the park. He sits on the bench and picks up the purple package with his good right hand, undoes the white ribbon around it, and tears at the paper. Inside is a brown cardboard box. The boy pulls off the lid, folds back purple tissue paper, and stares down. In the box is a comic, upside down. Very carefully, the boy turns the comic around on its bed of purple tissue. The cover features a heroic figure in a yellow cape fighting a powerfully built creature, half-man, half-beast, against a backdrop of New York skyscrapers. The woman sits gently beside the boy. The boy continues to stare down at the comic. She looks away and back at him. He glances up at her for a moment. As he looks down again, the words and colors fade, leaving a more detailed black and white version of the comic cover. The dark haired young man in suit and tie, whose face is reflected in the glass over the drawing, nods. The young man grins. Elijah limps across the gallery using a cane. Elijah turns back to stare at the man. As he does, David strides towards the gallery with Joseph a few paces behind. Inside, Elijah is walking away from the door and doesn't look around. Elijah turns. They're sitting in an office. Joseph gazes up at his father. Joseph looks from David to Elijah, then gets up and goes. Elijah, in a shimmering, purple, silk suit, gazes at David. David looks around as Joseph returns. David is sitting up on a bed, a pillow behind his head, reading the paper. Joseph is asleep, lying across him. His head on David's chest. One arm flung around him. David lowers the paper and glances at his son. He closes the paper, and very carefully slides out from under the sleeping boy.",
    "763": "He sits up. David puts his head on one side quizzically. He turns to see the weights on the ends of the bar, and Joseph walks up to him. David twists around to look at the other end of the bar. Joseph watches tensely. Joseph takes several paces back towards an open covered door. On the bench, David grips his hands out wider than his shoulders and takes the weight. He drops the bar slowly to his chest and pushes up until his arms are straight. He lowers the bar again and again straightens his arms, while Joseph stares. Finally, David drops the bar back onto the supports. David's hands wrap around the bar slowly feeling for the optimum grip. Even more weights have been clamped to the bar this time. David's frowning slightly. Joseph's standing in the cupboard. On his bench, David braces himself. He lowers the bar to his chest. Arms quivering, eyes tight shut, face twisted, he presses it up to full extension. He repeats the press and replaces the bar. Above the bar, Joseph's white face appears upside down to David. Joseph's standing two steps up the staircase. As the bar rises, two big paint cans appear taped to it next to the weights. David drops the bar back in its supports. His left arm flops to the floor. With his right still gripping the bar, he holds himself upright. Joseph comes down the stairs. He walks slowly over to David, who twists around to inspect the weights and the paint cans at either end of the bar. David's brow furrows. Joseph gazes at him in awe. Elijah is lying in a hospital bed. Elijah nods almost imperceptibly. Inside, Audrey is sorting through papers on a reception desk. A nurse approaches her. The nurse points across the room. Audrey hands the nurse a yellow file, takes another one from her, and walks across the open plan office. She leans through a doorway and smiles. Sitting on a low couch in a treatment room. She looks up at Elijah who's watching her from his wheelchair. Metal frame keeps his right leg straight. The street outside the stadium is empty. Inside, along one of the shaded walkways, David, in his security uniform, is leaning on a wall, casually watching spectators as they crowd in through a gate. He looks away and stares at the ground. After a moment, he pushes himself off the wall and moves to the center of the walkway and stands there with his head down and his hands in his pockets. The crowd streams past him, laughing and smiling. They jostle and bump him. Some almost pushing him aside, but he doesn't react. A large woman in a pink coat, blonde hair hanging over her shoulders, dragging a small boy by the hand, bangs into him.",
    "766": "The torch flows brightly. The shining light gives way to the pitch black darkness of space. A shining parabola cuts through the inky blackness. The curving edge of planet earth is illuminated dwarfing further planets in the distance. The glowing rings of Saturn arc around the planets central sphere. Fast solo flares erupt from the surface of the sun. Tendrils of white hot flame flicker around the billowing molten components. Whitout. Earth, a rainy night. The gates of the mine open and a taxi drives through. The passenger was the spectacled 30 something Adrian Hold. He spots a young boy sitting by a key, cuddling with a toy boat, to the driver. The driver ignores Adrian and drives through the puddle smashing the boy and his boat. Inside the Institute of Astro Physics University of New Delhi they stand on a rickety, descending limb. The lift reaches the bottom, a breaded man has been swithched over. Gurdeep grabs ice buckets. At a computer terminal. Another computer screen displays the solar eruptions. Adrian frowns at the screen. Gurdeep pours ice around Doctor Lokesh's feet. A door opens into a dark and a chamber containing a water tank. Gurdeep helps Satin open up the large tank. Adrian stares down into the tank. The water inside bubbles and boggles. He arrives at the Lincoln Plaza Hotel, Washington D.C. Adrian takes a document from his bag. Barely 40 something Anheuser frowns at Adrian. A peeved looking Anheuser turns slowly and takes the document from Adrian's hand. He puts his drink down on a waiter's tray then walks off with the document, fishing a pair of glasses from this top pocket, on the way past Adrian. Anheuser reads the document in a quiet corner of the party. Adrian stands behind him. Anheuser frowns, looks up and turns. With adrian duffle bags still in his arms, Scotty watches Adrian follow Anheuser from the party. Day time, police try to control an anti G8 protest. The car drives right across the spherical building. The distinguished looking 60 something US President Wilson enters the G8 Summit and scans around a large table where many other people are either standing or seated. An interpreter leaves the station. A large number of the other people present file out of the room. Wilson looks around at the double doors are closed behind him. Eight heads of state remain. Military choppers fly over the shore line village. locals board trucks. A young villager called Nima. Soldiers stopping Nima's brother Tenzen from following the truck as it drives away. Villagers raise their hands. Tenzen raises his hat. The Kernel points. The villagers look up as controlled explosions detonate high in the mountains. MI Techs Officer Isaac arrives outside his suite.",
    "768": "Nema stops the truck and climbs out. He looks back down the road to where Jackson stands arms raised. They run to the truck. On the ground Captain Michaels leads Anheuser's team across a walkway. There are many other walkers with people crossing to the waiting arks. Nora sees them and addresses Anheuser. They spot the Saudi prince and his family. Anheuser walks off with Michaels. Nora pats Adrian's shoulder and follows them. Crowds trudge along the Nampan Plateau. Among them are Satnam and his family. They stop and look around to see a gigantic tsunami heading for the coastline. The huge waves tower over Satnam and head straight for the refugees. Adrian is shown into a cabin on the escape ship. He glances around and picks up a goblet. He takes his ringing mobile from his bag. Leaving his phone switched on, Satnam crouches down and holds his son's face in his hands. They're deep in prayer as the tidal wave comes closer. Satnam and his wife hug their son between them as Adrian listens. Adrian throws away goblet. On the Arc bridge. Adrian rushes across the bridge to Scottie. The images have called up. Adrian turns to Anheuser. They look at another screen. Scottie hits a button. The old watch at the screen and now reads 2 hours, 6 minutes and 17 seconds. Anheuser turns away. After moving his spectacles closer to a group of people sitting at another bank of monitors. A revised countdown appears on their screens. Nema drives the truck with his grandparents in the cab with him. In the back, Jackson is with his family, Gordon and Tamara. Little Noah lies asleep, his head resting on Gordon's shoulder. Gordon glances up and sees Jackson watching them. Gordon stares ahead and speaks without looking at Jackson. He turns his head. They pass a sign utility gate 17 east. Nema stops the truck. Tenzen opens the gate. Nema looks over his shoulder. She nudges the kids forward. Kate spots Nema's grandma. Tenzen glances up at Lily and Noah. Then beckons them forward. Yuri and the others are in the ship bay. Yuri thumped the security guard as he looked behind. The crowd pushes past and enters the bay. Yuri overlooks the arc. Tenzen leads Kate, Jackson and the others towards the mountainside as it opens revealing the ship bays. She calls on a passing science officer. Tenzen leads everyone up a launch tower staircase. On the bridge. Jackson and Noah head up the lunchpad. Noah stares up at the anchors dangling from a gigantic ship's hull. The wind ruffles his hair. Jackson grabs Noah and they hurry up towards the ark. The Russian President is led onto an ark bridge by his interpreter.",
    "769": "He scans around. Chancellor looks out over the loading bay. Yuri leads a fast crowd running across the wide boarding platform. As Tenzen and the others board the ship, Grandpa slips. Jackson reacts and grabs his arm. Tenzen nods to Jackson. The crowd on the boarding platform reach a deep pit around the ark. A man plummets into the pit and the crowd stops running. On the ark bridge. Outside the enormous rear life supports move into position. Nearby, Jackson and the others walk in towards the hedge. He looked down at the struggling crowd and the boarding platform below. Yuri says something. From down there up from high on the hull Tamara spots Caesar on the ground. Inside the hatch Jackson holds a torch as Tenzen unwinds a sealed shaft. Caesar makes it to Tamara as the outer hatch closes. Yuri watches angrily. She sticks a finger up at him. Then the hatch slams shut. Inside, Jackson, Gordon and the others shine torches as Tenzen shoulders a pneumatic drill. Nema looks up hopefully as Tenzen pulls open a round hatch. On the control bridge, Adriane and Laura watch horrified as members of the crowd outside plunge off the boarding platform into the pit. With a deep frown, Adriane crosses the bridge. Macarenka watches the screen on board his ark. Anheuser shakes his head at Adriane. Adriane looks down relieved. Anheuser hangs his head. Michaels picks up the phone on the control desk. In a darkened corridor. Tamara shines her torch on various animals in cages. As the gates open, a hydraulic ceiling lowers above them, knocking Gordon and Tenzen off a ladder. Jackson struggles to help the injured Tenzen and Gordon, who cling on just above grinding gears. Gordon is dragged between the wheels. Uri stares up at the lowering gate. He reaches up from the lower ledge, and tries to haul himself back onto the boarding platform. Tenzen is trapped between the gears and the rapidly descending hydraulic ceiling. Jackson is trapped between a wire fence and the hydraulic ceiling. Tenzen's drill has become tangled in the gears. Sparks fly. Jackson reaches out in desperation as the hydraulic wall draws near to the gate. The gears grind into a halt. The wall stops. Hundreds of people leap onto the gate and board the Arc. Anheuser watches the chaos anxiously. He looks around with a digital camera. Flower petals blow from a bowl in the mountaintop monastery. Lama looks up from his seat on the floor as the wind picks up. He scans around. In the distance, a gigantic wall of water crashes its way between the peaks of the snow-covered mountains. Lama rings the monastery bell as the water quickly closes in.",
    "772": "He stops for a security scan. Inside the opulent suite, Isaac sits opposite a Saudi prince who holds an electronic document in his hands. The prince wears a pair of sunglasses, the Techs reflected in them. The prince removes his sunglasses. A group of workers roll a storage crate through a darkened exhibition hall. They open the crate, which contains a replica of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. The workers replace the Mona Lisa with the replica. He shines a torch on the hanging replica. He shines the torch over the replica's candles, highlighting Mona Lisa's mouth. A TV broadcast shows a Mayan temple. Handsome, dark-haired, 30-something Jackson leaps off his couch when he was sleeping and rushes into his bathroom to clean his teeth. He answers the phone on his way out. Jackson silently curses his car and walks out of the garage. Jackson gets into a stretch limo with black dark windows and drives off past the surface. A jagged crack in the road stretches around the corner. Kids jump over it. He arrives at his ex-wife Kay's house. Standing on the grand way, the barrel looks stunned as the moored ship lists up and down dramatically in San Francisco Harbor. Passengers stumble as the boat's hull crunches into the docks. Ship stewards help passengers up as Harry and his friend Terry scan around. Frowning. In bed, Laura wakes and answers her phone. Roland is driving. The back of Roland's car explodes as he is driving. The car flips forward and glows into flames. Jackson's limo rounds a corner on the way to Yellowstone National Park. Wilson looks across the Oval Office at Anheuser. Laura enters with a newspaper. A story about Roland's death. She turns on the TV. She ignores Adrian. Wilson eyes Anheuser who gets up to go. Adrienne follows. She sits down heavily on one of the sofas. President Wilson pulls up a chair and sits in front of her. He puts his hand over hers. At Yellowstone Park, Jackson drops his daughter Lily's hat over a fence then climbs after it. Lily and her brother, Noah, follow Jackson along a sparse trail. They arrive at a clearing with a parched, lake basin in the middle. They head down to the cordoned off basin which is bubbly and marshy underfoot. Big tripods have been positioned within the cordon. Jackson and the kids approach a dead, rotting stag. Stationed amongst the trees on a hillside, somebody watches the three of them through binoculars. Steam rises from the lake bed around Jackson. He takes his kids' hands as a conveyor army comes arising in the top in front of him. The watcher in the trees is a guy called Charlie Frost.",
    "780": "Guests gather for a wedding. A young bridesmaid sits and watches. The two girls walk back down the aisle. The elder one admires herself in a mirror. The bride's dress is ripped. Jane gives a knowing smile and eyes the ribbon in Tess' hair. Jane proudly holds the train of the ribbon repaired dress. Carrying the bulky dress in a bag, adult Jane, in a formal purple dress, hurries out of the shop onto a busy New York street. Pausing for breath on a street corner, another young woman walks up wearing the same purple dress. Tess nudges her bored friend. Jane rushes out of the ceremony. She hurries over to the cab. She starts getting changed in the back seat. The cabby looks in his mirror. A drive through the colorfully lit New York night pulling up below the brookyln bridge. She gets out of the cab wearing a red sari. She places a jeweled bindi on a friend's forehead. Flinging herself back into the cab, she frantically starts changing again. The cabby sneaks another look. She's back at the first wedding. A handsome, dark-haired guy who was at the ceremony watches her with raised eyebrows as she heads off in the cab again. She's dancing. First in her Indian dress. Then after another dive for the cab, in her purple one. After some energetic dancing, she emerges from another cab ride. Once more in her Indian finery. She kicks off the wrong shoes. The cabby throws her the right ones. She joins in some choreographed dancing. Later on, she catches the sari in the cab door. She helps both brides with their dresses as they sit on their toilets. She gets back into the swing of the choreography, the Jewish Indian party. Then rushes in disarray into the other wedding just as the bride and groom are stuffing cake into each other's mouths. It's a bindi. Jane smiles in delight, arms outstretched, as the bridal bouquet is thrown and sails straight towards her. Then she's barged to the floor by an over-zealous competitor. Everything goes black. As Jane comes hazily to, the dark-haired guy is looking down at her. She blinks up at him and touches a hand to her sore head as two other guests arrive. She gives a tight smile. She sways unsteadily, clutching her head. The lights at the city twinkle in the night as the pair share a cab. They sit as far apart as possible, a huge bunch of flowers between them. She pays. Kevin grabs the flowers. The truck drives between them. As Kevin sits in the cab smiling to himself, he looks down and notices Jane's filofax on the floor. Looking thoughtful, he opens the filofax.",
    "782": "She goes to the bathroom and moisturizes her hands, then does some work at her laptop. Shuffling papers, she once again glances at the door. She does some sit ups, then, in rubber gloves, cleans the cooker. Jane struggles with her emotions. Next day, the sisters arrive at Hell's hardware store. Jane lets the door close on Tess. Her father stares at Jane's agonized expression. As Tess and George flirt in his office, Jane frowns, seeing Kevin's name in her filofax. Jane dials Kevin's number. Grinning, Kevin hangs up. A youngster with a baseball glove comes in. Pedro frowns. They arrive at the Department of Parks and Recreation Youth Sports ground. Jane stares at her. Pedro, practicing his catching, grins at them from the baseball field. Jane rolls her eyes in disbelief. A large bunch of yellow flowers is delivered. Jane hands them to Tess with a tight smile. She brings a pile of paperwork to George's office. She grins as he talks happily on the phone. Her smile fades as she notices pictures of him and Tess on the desk. They all have dinner at Jane's father's house. As Tess chatters and the men smile, Jane unhappily stuffs her face with food. At her apartment she catches Tess and George kissing on the couch. Looking crushed, she leaves them to it and goes out again. Attending a leather and bondage wedding, Jane, sporting a spiked leather collar, tries to appear in party mood. She gamely flicks the heavy metal devil horns at George and Tess, who, grinning, do the same. As they kiss, Jane looks mortified. Casey catches her eye, looks over at the lovebirds. George holds up two ties for her approval. He nods, tight-lipped, as she knots the tie. She smiles after him and heads back to her desk. In the evening at the office, Jane tidies away some files on George's desk. Underneath, she finds his wallet. Consulting his appointments, she heaves a sigh and leaves. A taxi pulls up outside a restaurant and Jane gets out. It's Tess' turn to look stunned. Jane is at a loss. There's a small white box tucked in the dog's collar. The box contains a diamond ring. He slips the ring on her finger and they kiss as Jane stands helplessly nearby. It's a wedding dress. Jane meets up with Kevin in a bar. She looks pleased with herself. He takes her hand. Jane stares in shock across the Central Park boating lake. They go back to their yoga. There's a meeting at the New Warsaw bakery. It's Kevin clapping. She grabs Kevin's arm. Jane looks tearful, but pulls herself together. Kevin looks down a street past a shop and up the steps to Jane's building.",
    "784": "Kevin arrives, stares at Jane, then starts to sneak off. George spots him. Kevin turns, feigning surprise. Jane's smile fades. Headlights blazing, the aging Volvo speeds through the rainy night. The car swerves alarmingly. The car slides backwards down a grassy slope, just missing a tree. Coming to a halt, they sit frozen in shock. Tires spin, digging into the wet ground. They stick their cell phones out of the windows trying to get a signal. They sit not looking at each other. Kevin and Jane arrive soaking wet at a bar. Jane checks the public telephone, but indicates with a roll of her eyes that it's not working. They head to the bar. He flops onto a barstool. Two empty glasses hit the bar. She grins at him. She gawks at him. It's his turn to be taken aback. They grin tipsily. The locals start to enjoy their goofy performance. They're up on the bar with everybody gathered round, singing and urging them on. Jane is bear foot and Kevin keeps on coming up with wacky dance moves. Kevin jumps down, leaving Jane dancing wildly to the delight of the crowd. Kevin then helps her down. She lurches drunkenly, and he stops her from falling. They stare in each others' eyes, then Jane kisses him hard and passionately. They carry on kissing in the Volvo and tearing off each others' soaking wet clothes. The next day, Kevin strolls down the grassy slope carrying two coffees. The early sun reflects off the windows, and Jane is still asleep in the mud-spattered car. He looks around, acting nonchalant. They go to a diner. Kevin's expression freezes. Jane crumples up the paper, throws it at Kevin, and leaves. She stares at him with bitter disappointment, then turns on her heel and leaves. He walks back to the diner, his face in his hands. Later, he strides into the newspaper offices and approaches Maureen. He leaves, angry and frustrated. Jane arrives at her apartment. She overturns a chair. She throws the phone, screws up the paper, and stomps on it. Jane sits staring miserably into space. At the office, she picks up her messages. She runs her hands through her shoulder-length hair and throws her arms defensively. Casey comes in. They exchange a worried look, and Jane walks slowly towards George's office. He places a caring hand on her shoulder to escort her out. Tess is at the bridal shop. Jane is puzzled. Jane walks over to Tess looking horrified. Tess looks puzzled as Jane walks out. Tess pouts and flounces back to her fitting room, tripping over her hem as she goes. As lights begin to decorate the evening cityscape, a taxi drops Jane off at the restaurant where guests are gathering for the engagement party.",
    "788": "The vans pull up the road side. As he gets closer, he sees it's Marcus waving a torch. Gin stops in front of Marcus, who moves his Stetson and gets out of the car with a wary expression. He shakes his head weirdly. Marcus gives him a helpless look. Gin heads back to his car and Marcus smiles. Gin lifts the bonnet of his Chevy. Bonnet up, Gin steps back from the car. Marcus steps forward with the jump leads but can't reach the battery. Marcus backs away from between the car and the van as Lois starts the van up. Gin leans back against the grill of the Chevy and lights himself a smoke. Marcus nods to Lois and she drops the van into gear, hits the gas, and crushes Gin between the two vehicles. Lois reverses and Gin slithers down the grill of the Chevy onto the ground. Marcus walks up to him. Marcus sighs and walks to the van. He removes the jump start cables from the van, returns to Gin and clips them onto his ears. Back at Thurman's, Willie opens the front door to Sue, who's got a bag of groceries. He eyes her figure appreciatively. In the kitchen, Thurman and Willie make necklaces out of pieces of popcorn. She adds it to a big bowl. In the hall, Sue stands on a chair to put decorations on the tree. Willie stares, mesmerized by her backside, and begins fondling it. She pushes his hand away, so he reaches up and unzips the back of her skirt. She quickly does it back up and gives Willie a kiss. In the lounge, Grandma has conked out on the sofa. Sue carefully removes her slippers and then peels off her sheer, hold-up socks. She hands one to Willie, and they pin the socks up at the fireplace. They exchange a smile and leave Grandma to slumber on. Later, Willie is at the front of the house lighting the candle bags Herb had come around organizing. Thurmond comes out of the house and walks over to Willie as one of the bags catches alight. Willie stamps out the blazing bag. Willie looks around awkwardly. Thurmond looks down sadly, and Willie relents. Bemused Willie shakes his hand. Thurmond hurries off into the house, and Willie allows himself a faint smile. Once Thurmond is gone, Willie turns around and goes back to lighting the candle bags. In the mall, all the security guard bids the last shoppers farewell. Lois is amongst the shoppers. She makes a show of looking at a price tag on a table laden with sweaters, and, at the same time, pushes the table into a new position. She makes a minor adjust to its position and heads off.",
    "79": "A barn is in the background. The sun rises. The camera remains in the same position. John awakes. They lie huddled in calm sleep. They get up and start into the kitchen. John and Rachel watch a moment. They start for the stove. Rachel puts her gun beside the stove, ready to hand, and picks up a coffee-pot; John puts kindling in stove. John looks at her a moment. They look towards the sound. We shoot over two troopers. Sirens loud, they rapidly approach Rachel's house as Rachel, without gun, holding John's hand, comes down to fence. Presently, the other children hurry out of house behind. The car brakes. The troopers, fanning wide, advance towards barn. Rachel and the children are grouped a short distance behind them. The barn door gapes black. A short pause; then Preacher appears. Troopers close in on Preacher, from before and behind, exactly as for Ben's arrest. The same sickly look, as at Ben's arrest. One trooper smacks the back of Preacher's head with a pistol-barrel. The doll has burst open and the money has spilled over Preacher. Now two troopers gently lift John away. Rachel lifts him in her arms; she turns towards house. She carries John towards the house. His head hangs back over her arm. Perhaps ten faces. Most are frenetic. Our two loafers are having fun. General hubbub off-screen. A gavel off-screen. He looks to sound of gavel. The hubbub and the gaveling stop. John looks over his shoulder in same direction as the gavel. John looks at the finger. A short pause. The lawyer's hands gently help him from chair. Lawyer's hands consign John to Rachel. Above John's head, by winding and holding to ear, Rachel pantomimes a watch. Everyone in the cafe stands up. Rachel gathers her parcels. Icey rushes to door and opens it. She turns to crowd. Icey shouts into the cafe. Icey turns to the street mob. Rachel hurries her children to door. Icey leaves door to yell at mob. As Rachel leaves shot, the cashier shuts and locks the door. Mary and Clary come out first and start walking to our left. Rachel comes out and hurries off to our right, followed by John, holding Pearl's hand. We pan to Mary and Clary. They turn and we pan with them as they hurry after Rachel, and we bring in Rachel, charging away from us with her brood hustling to keep up. Icey carries a torch. She is flanked by rabid faces and by smiling loafers, one of whom carries an axe. As she speaks, a man rushes up to Walt and gives him a rope. We pan Rachel and children past this street and they hurry towards Ruby, who stands alone in background, facing the jail. In background, Rachel and children hurry towards her.",
    "794": "They knock their drinks back, and Willie puffs on his cigarette. She nods and looks at his glass. She pours him another shot, and then one for herself. They down them in one. She gives him a coy look. And he does, in his beaten up old car. After the festive fornication, Willie leans against the car having a smoke. She gets out of the car and faces him. He half smiles and nods. She gives him a smile and heads off. Once she's gone, the moody looking Indian guy from the bar runs over and shoves Willie. Curly head Fat Ass pulls Mr. Not Gay off Willie. Mr. Not Gay marches off into the night. Willie catches his breath and turns to Fat Ass. Fat Ass turns to him. Sometime later Wille gives fat ass a lift and left home in his knacker old car. Sitting in the passenger seat, the kid stares at him and smiles warmly. Wille looks away from it. Apparently unmoved, the kid keeps staring at Willie. Willie turns off his engine and one working headlight, then gets out of the car with the kid. Willie admires the affluent suburban house they're in front of. Willie frowns. As the kid unlocks the door, Willie pulls out a cotch and puts on a black balaclava. Inside, Grandma is watching a TV program featuring dancing fruit. Grandma walks past Willie, apparently unmoved by the fact that Santa is wearing a black balaclava. Willie turns to the kid. The kid nods. Willie pulls up his balaclava. He sure does. Willie opens it and removes wads of cash and a passport. Willie shuts the safe and goes and sits down in an armchair. The credulous kid beams at him. The very nice BMW which Wille drives away in. The next day at the mall, Bob, the manager, is doing his rounds. He strolls through a woman's wear shop for larger ladies. Some noise is emanating from the changing room catches attention. Bob decides to go and investigate. Bob looks under a cubicle door and sees a woman's feet and, behind them, a man's with red Santa pants at his ankles. In Bob's office. Marcus gives Bob a reproachful look and takes a candy from a jar on his desk as he goes. Later, Marcus wanders through a restaurant in the mall sipping a coke. He spots Willie putting the moves on a hot-bodied blonde at a pinball machine. Wille thrusts his crotch into the blonde. The BMW. As he opens the car door, a pile of empties spill out. He drives off crashing them on his wheels. Bob is with Gin, the security chief. Gin eats an orange. Bob winces at the phrase.",
    "799": "Rows of old film studio buildings reflected in a shiny, gold surface. A shaky animation of a figure wearing a long coat and a hat. The figure runs towards light. Its arms spread out and become wings. It takes flight. As a bird, it comes to rest. Al-Saleem, a bearded man wearing a loose-fitting robe and a pale cream cap. In a house, three young Middle Eastern men listen to Al-Saleem on a television. On a cordoned-off street, a policeman pats the roof of a milk float. The milk float drives off. Armed special branch officers dressed in black run across wasteland. More officers huddle on a street corner as the milk float drives around. Officers make their way upstairs at the back of a boarded up house. Officers train their automatic weapons on the front of the terraced house. The Sikh milkman stops and picks up some pints of milk. The marksman on the roof takes aim. Daylight floods through windows into the gloomy house. The milkman walks up to the front door and puts two pints of milk on the doorstep. One of the armed officers opens the back door and enters. The three men are alerted. Bomb making equipment is spread out on a table. One of the officers who's just entered points at the ceiling. One of the men presses a key on a mobile phone. A golden fireball rips through the building. Police and civilians dive for cover as debris rains down. Thick, gray smoke fills the air. Plumes of smoke rise into the air. Letters emerge from brief flashes of grainy surveillance footage. Densely packed buildings bisected by streets. A casually dressed young man with a beard lies on a bed. Deep in troubled thought, his brow is pinched. The man, Ferris, recalls sitting in a room, watching as a prisoner is gagged and beaten to death with a cricket bat. In a large house, a craggy faced guy in his 40s, Edward Hoffman, dictates into a laptop. On TV. Ferris cocks a pistol. A meeting room. A car is blown up. A soldier is shot. Hoffman talks to officials. Ferris, wearing jeans, shirt, casual top, and a baseball cap, sits at an Iraqi street cafe, sipping coffee. A four-by-four pulls up. The driver, Bassam, has long black hair and a ponytail. He yells to Ferris. Ferris picks up his bag and his coffee and gets in the four-by-four. Ferris sips his coffee as Bassam drives. A checkpoint. On a dirt road. They're watched. Ferris looks at a stone house through binoculars. Goats swarm around in front. Bassam calls on his mobile. They're watched on a screen in a CIA surveillance room.",
    "803": "Bassam gets out. Bassam gives Ferris the finger and walks down the track. Ferris gets out. In the surveillance room, Ferris stands by a wall. Bassam walks along the track with Nizar. Ferris takes out his cell phone and looks at it. He sees something glinting in the sky. The Predator drone, an unmanned surveillance aircraft, is flown to a higher altitude. Nizar gets in the front of the vehicle. Sitting in the back, Ferris eats the orange. Nizar looks down anxiously. Nizar looks away. Nizar opens his mouth and looks ahead thoughtfully. Nizar unzips his coat, takes out a computer disk and offers it to Ferris. Ferris watches the disk on his laptop. Al-Saleem appears on screen. Ferris makes a call on his cell phone. Hoffman is sitting on his yacht, moored by a jetty near his large house. Hoffman's wife comes out of the house. Ferris hangs up, puts on his shades and walks down the track to Bassam and Nizar. Ferris aims his gun. Hoffman sits staring at a surveillance screen. On it, Ferris and Bassam, both using cell phones, watch Nizar ride along a busy street in a town, on a moped. The guys shoot Nizar. He falls. The four men pick up the injured Nizar and carry him to the back of the van. Ferris aims a pistol and shoots Nizar in the head. Ferris runs. The surveillance screen shows the scene from above. Hoffman takes a call from Ferris, who walks with Bassam. Bassam and Ferris drive along a dirt road and stop at the top of a hill. Bassam reverses the vehicle a few feet. Ferris creeps up behind some rocks. He takes out his binoculars and looks down at a collection of stone houses. A man stands by a fire on which a pile of CDs and cassettes is burning. Ferris radios Bassam. Bassam gets a rifle from the back of the four-by-four. Wearing traditional robes, a jacket and skull cap, Ferris walks down the hill, towards the Iraqi by the fire. Bassam gets down by some rocks and pulls out the rifle's stand. The man at the fire sees Ferris and frowns. Ferris speaks Arabic. Ferris looks around. Bassam looks through a telescopic sight at Mehdi, a bearded man, as he walks out. Bassam shoots him. Ferris kills the man by the fire. A man pops up from behind a wall. Bassam shoots him. A young man runs out of the house, gun blazing. Bassam drives down and makes a call. Ferris throws a grenade into a courtyard and runs in shooting. He exchanges fire with the young man. Two choppers fly towards the scene. The young man peers out from behind a wall.",
    "804": "Ferris shoots him. Ferris runs to the house. Ferris enters the house with his gun held out in front. He turns a corner and sees a man holding a detonator with wires attached. Ferris shoots him and runs out. As the house blows up, Ferris is thrown off his feet. The black choppers fly above a winding river, then a forest. Bassam drags Ferris to the four-by-four. Ferris burns his hand as he grabs CDs and cassettes from the fire. Bassam drags him to the four-by-four, throws him in the back and drives off. Explosions rip through the buildings. Two four-by-fours drive towards Ferris and Bassam. Ferris cocks a rifle. Ferris shoots at the other vehicles as they approach. They collide on a bend and ram into a rock. Bassam drives off along a dirt road. The two choppers fly over the desert. Ferris keeps shooting at the Iraqis as they follow in the four-by-fours. Bassam radios. The choppers fly overhead. An Iraqi in each of the pursuing four-by-fours loads a rocket-propelled grenade into a launcher. Ferris leans out of the window and shoots at them. The RPG grazes a chopper and the chopper destroys one of the four-by-fours. The other four-by-four gains on Ferris and Bassam. The chopper fires a rocket which destroys the second four-by-four and knocks Ferris and Bassam's four-by-four onto its roof. It slides to a stop in the dirt, throwing Ferris about in the back. One of the choppers lands. A soldier runs to Ferris. Ferris is hauled into the chopper. A soldier knocks Ferris out with an injection and the chopper takes off. Ferris lies by the open hatch. His face splattered with blood. Lying in a hospital, Ferris remembers being with Bassam and his family. The Iraqi prisoner being beaten to death. A doctor leans over Ferris, who wakes. In a yard outside, soldiers are playing basketball. Using tweezers, the doctor picks a sharp fragment from an open wound in Ferris' arm. He puts it with many other fragments in a kidney bowl. U.S. Military Base, Qatar, Persian Gulf. Ferris sits outside. Ferris takes a phone from the agent. Ferris frowns and stares intensely. Ferris hangs up and looks down. There's a bandage around his left forearm. He picks at a small bloody wound and digs out a splinter of bone. He holds up the tiny pointed fragment on his fingertip for a moment. Ferris opens a matchbox and drops the fragment into it. Deep in thought, he rubs his hands together. A grand boulevard with palm trees along strips of grass running between the lanes of traffic. Ferris is in a dirty black BMW with a heavy-set guy wearing shades, Skip.",
    "806": "Ferris pulls himself free and clambers over the wall. He makes a call as he limps across wasteland. Skip parks the BMW on a busy street, and he and Ferris get out. They walk into a health clinic. In a treatment room, Ferris sits up on a bed. A doctor attends to him. The doctor leaves and the pretty young nurse, Aisha, walks in. She gets a packet from a cabinet and goes to Ferris. She looks at the deep, bloody bites on Ferris' leg. She looks at his bloody hands and cut arm. He smiles, and she prepares a syringe. She walks around to him, smiling. Ferris studies her as she holds up the syringe and flicks it. He winces as she injects him in the stomach. He calls Hoffman. Hoffman gets in his car next to his daughter. Two men in suits open gates and the Mercedes drives into a courtyard. It stops behind another car which Hani is leaning against, smoking. Ferris gets out of the Mercedes looking a little apprehensive. He walks up to Hani. He throws his cigarette away. Hani leads Ferris along a corridor. Hani goes to a door with a window in it and knocks on the glass. On the other side, a man lowers a flap and Ferris looks into the room. Hoffman's agent, Zayed Ibishi, is naked and tied down on a table. A man whips him. Ferris turns away. Ferris watches the flogging, his eyes narrowed. A young man wearing a black kufi wheels a bicycle with heavily laden panniers out onto a street. He stops by some bins, lifts the lid of one of them and takes out two paper cups. He takes a piece of paper from one of the cups. The young man wheels his bicycle away. Noordermarkt. A bustling, covered marketplace. People are crowded in the street and around flower stalls. A young man with his black hair swept back locks a car, then notices a tourist lining up a photograph. Head down, the man briskly walks past the tourist, pressing the keys of a mobile phone. The car explodes, sending shock waves through the marketplace. Black and white frame-by-frame images of the explosion, which is blanked out by static. Smoke hangs over the marketplace. Ferris, in his apartment, and Hani, at home with his wife, watch the news. Al-Saleem watches the report. Ferris meets Marwan. Ferris looks at Hani, who's sitting in his car. Ferris sits in the back next to Hani and Marwan shuts the door. They drive across the desert in a convoy of black cars. The photos Ferris showed Hani. On a vast expanse of brown earth, a suited man stands beside a kneeling figure, whose head is covered with a black hood.",
    "81": "We watch, for a moment more, the two sleeping faces. We are in Peacock Alley. The tree-shaded dirt street of a small, one-street river town; a picturesque, mid-19th-century remnant of the old river civilization, which general progress has left behind. They stroll barefoot down the empty dirt sidewalk. They look towards the voices, PEARL friendly, JOHN hostile. Several, within the door of the Schoolhouse, stick their heads around the edge. They chant at the HARPER CHILDREN. Another, next the door, is drawing something on the wall. OVER these lines we CUT briefly to -- chanting, drawing. The ARTIST completes in chalk, a large simple sketch of a man hanging from gallows. As the verse ends we CUT TO: They look towards OUR CHILDREN; JOHN pays them no attention. JOHN takes PEARL'S hand. We SHOOT them through the window of MIZ CUNNINGHAM'S second-hand store. The back of a watch is silhouetted large in FOREGROUND; JOHN'S eyes instantly fix on it; in b.g. the SCHOOL-CHILDREN finish their song and vanish, giggling, into the schoolhouse. A watch with a moving sweep-hand, ticking. OVER a shop-doorbell we hear: PEARL watches her; JOHN, the watch. He walks off fast as we DOLLY BEHIND THEM; he leads PEARL, who hugs her doll. A few paces in silence; now they come to the big window of Spoon's Ice Cream Parlor. WILLA'S face is seen within; serving a customer, she sees them and waves them away. He keeps her strolling. WALT SPOON, comes out, proffering two lollypops. A short, lighted, toy-like train departs the town along the river-bank, whistling. The whistle TIES OVER the previous. A square, HEAD-ON SHOT, river water below and vibrant starlight above; featuring a gas-lamp by the road; a tree; and pretty tree-shadows which work across a window. PEARL lies in their bed, her doll snug on her shoulder. JOHN sits on the edge of the bed, in his underwear. He moves, and as his shadow moves away we see the shadow of PREACHER, motionless. PEARL sits up and points at it. JOHN notices her and sees it. We PAN JOHN to the window. He looks out. He stands motionless. He turns and we PAN him to bed. People are waving from shore and boat. We PAN her into frame UNCLE BIRDIE STEPTOE'S toy-like little wharf-boat. As she passes broadside we CUT TO: as boat passes. BIRDIE'S head sticks through a porthole. He is a wiry old river character. The boat whistles. As BIRDIE speaks we PAN JOHN, and foundered skiff, into TWO-SHOT with. We PAN JOHN from skiff to wharf and Birdie's door. JOHN enters and sits on a box. BIRDIE, in a ramshackle rocking chair, pours coffee. He gives JOHN a cup of coffee.",
    "813": "There's a stampede. Handbags, shoes, and gloves, all for the taking. She puts the tall pinkie boots down. A woman grabs them. The woman snatches them. Rebecca jumps on her. At home, her head shoveled, she sits contemplating the mountain of shopping bags in front of her, including the Gucci boots. A message from Luke demanding the outline pops up on her laptop. She looks at her watch, then slumps down at her desk in front of her laptop. Idly, she pulls a coat from one of her bags. Her face folds as she reads the label. Rebecca looks at an empty photo frame on Luke's desk. Luke regards here with a twinkle in his eye. Hayley brings Rebecca a note. Luke picks up the phone. Hayley rushes back in. Like a woman possessed, Rebecca clambers onto the slippery boardroom table on all fours, propelling herself at the phone. Later in his office, with Hayley in attendance, Luke looks earnestly into Rebecca's face. Luke glances dubiously at Hayley. Rebecca smiles meekly. At her desk, she opens a letter. At her home, Rebecca's smiling dad magics a coin from behind her ear and puts it into her outstretched hand. He plunks himself down on an easy chair that tips back. Rebecca's expectant smile freezes. A recreational vehicle comes crashing around the corner with Graham at the wheel. Rebecca's face brightens. At the office, Wilson is looking at an Asian Web page. She wears a flirty fishing for something kind of expression. Suze is trying on a frothy white tulle wedding dress. Suze's mom tries on her veil. Yawning with exhaustion, Luke steps into a lift to join Alette swaved in fur and leggy Alicia. Alette sweeps out. Alicia trips and falls into Luke's arms. In Miami, Florida, home to sun-kissed beaches and a marina full of private boats, Luke and Rebecca are at a magazine conference. Alicia goes off in a huff. Smiling women crowd around Rebecca. She grins across at Luke, whose eyebrows shoot up with amusement. A waitress hands her a cocktail. Rebecca notices the man's name tag. A bony-faced, sandy head man. She nose-nuzzles in Eskimo style. Luke leaves her to it. She peers blankly at Janne. Luke glancing oversees him waiting for an answer. She slaps Janne's face. Alicia, pouring champagne, misses the glass as she watches in horror. She answers her mobile. She glances around furtively. On a breezy terrace. She takes a deep, deep breath. She takes him to a men's store. He slumps on a seat. He shoots her a look. She recoils. She straightens his bow tie. She helps him on with a black tuxedo. She sits down and faces him. He pulls her onto the dance floor, puts one arm around her waist, and clasps her right hand in his left hand.",
    "814": "He steps forward. She grasps his shoulder and tosses back her long, straightened hair, then steps back as he steps forward. Her high-heeled, sandaled feet fall in with his dance step. Holding both her hands in his, he twirls her towards him, twisting her arms across her waist. Keeping their heads still, they move around in a circle. She unravels from his hold, whacking his cheek with her fan and slapping his face with her long, tossing hair. Resuming their initial position, holding waist and shoulder, they whirl altogether. She leans back seductively and flicks the fan. Luke looks both startled and pleased as she flutters her eyelashes at him from behind the fan. He spins her again. Breaking from his hold, she dances an improvise solo, waving the fan in front of her chest, her waist, and even her bottom. Like smiles awkwardly, vaguely claps his hands to accompany his unpredictable dancing partner. Suddenly, she disappears only to reappear behind him, swaying wildly from side to side, all the while waving the fan in front of her. He tries to reconnect. She whacks him again, but then settles back in his arms. Later, they walk back to their hotel. Alicia, sipping champagne on a sofa in the lobby, uncrosses her endless legs. She struts towards him. She strokes and kisses his cheek. Rebecca turns away, trying to mask her disappointment. New York, she sits glumly in the back of a Yellow Cab as it crosses Times Square. Her chin resting on one blue cashmere-gloved hand, she answers her mobile. Rebecca dives to the floor of the cab. She finds her black and white dress. Suze is propelled across the room and buried under the avalanche of clothes. Tall D. Freak smiles at his neighbor. Rebecca, wearing her sample blue gloves, faces the group. At home, Rebecca runs to the fridge and frantically searches through the freezer. She brings out a huge block of ice in the middle of which is a credit card. She smashes the block onto the counter and the floor, and bangs at it with a yellow stiletto heel and then a thicker wooden heel. She holds the now smaller block onto the floor and wrestles with it. Using two hair dryers, she melts it down, and eureka! Armed with the card, she goes to store and spots a cute melon-shaped bag. It's the group leader. Rebecca waves at Lainley. The group leader clutches a shoe to her forehead. The night of the ball. Luke, Alicia, and Rebecca ride up in the lift. Rebecca is a beaded black and silver jacket. Alicia glances down at her and smiles. The lift doors open onto a sumptuous ballroom.",
    "816": "In the bridal shop, Rebecca, in a pink maid of honor dress, is blind-folded. The petticoat is blue and green. Suze spots a Barney's carrier bag. As Rebecca runs down the street with two store bags, a black car draws up. A tall, silver-haired woman in a beret gets out. Rebecca runs into the meeting. The smart, silver-haired woman sits down, and looks round at the group. She holds up Rebecca's shopping bag. The group come to a thrift shop. Ryuichi puts up his hand. The basketball player picks her up and shakes her. She runs back to the thrift shop. But the surly girl in a wheelchair. Graham switches on his TV. Jane elbows Graham with excitement. The studio audience turn to look at him. Rebecca covers her face. Smeath's jaw drops. Tarquin chokes on his cereal. Smeath waves the list of excuses at the studio audience. Rebecca, sitting next to Luke, gives him a helpless look. Her eyes brim with tears. Seeing Luke's disappointed face, she shuts her eyes, and bows her head. He strides out of the TV studio. Miserably she wanders home in her purple dress and Yves Saint Laurent coat. Suze bursts out of the front door to meet her. The bag lady, with the shopping trolley, comes by in a pink dress with a green and blue petticoat. Rebecca searches for an explanation. Rebecca's face crumples. Luke pauses, suddenly derailed by his own feelings. Graham and Jane's mobile home pulls up outside Rebecca and Suze's building. Mr. West eyes Luke. Ryan smiles unpleasantly. Luke looks blown away. Rebecca, wandering along a wintry lake shore, is a tiny dot in the distance. Jane and Graham are by their mobile home. Jane brings out a book. Graham joins Rebecca by the lake shore. She shoots him a look. Looking up into her dad's jowly face, looking at her with fierce deep love, Rebecca smiles. He puts an arm around her, and she lays her head on his big barrel chest. Tears roll down Jane's face as she watches her giant of a husband standing facing the lake, with his arm around Rebecca. At home, Rebecca finds a note from Suze. Glumly she steps into the room, and looks at all the clothes piled up on the bed. Rebecca, looking nervous, emerges from the changing cabin in the purple dress. Alette nods. Rebecca smiles at her reflection in the mirror, then looks at the label of the dress. Alicia watches her with a smug smile. The flouncy purple dress. Alicia cringes. Alette considers. She hands Alicia Rebecca's bag. Long-legged Alicia is left holding the bag. She slams it down, and slumps next to it. Her eyes narrowing, she opens the bag and picks up the mobile. Alicia joins them.",
    "817": "She slumps down, and gazes miserably at a photograph of herself and black-haired Suze laughing together. In his office, Luke picks up the empty photo frame from his desk, and looks at it with a sigh. He adds it to the other personal things he's put in a cardboard box. Alicia appears at his door. Graham brings Alette a cup. Jane can't do tiny. All eyes are on her as she cuts a millimeter slice. Alette's perfectly made up eyes blink. Alette gives a Gallic shrug. Luke is in a bank. At the shopaholic meeting, the door bursts open. Group members put up their hands. At Dantay-West, Allon, the receptionist, gets an email about a sale and auction by the girl in the green scarf. At her desk, Haley looks at her inbox, and her eyes widen. She's holding a piece of paper behind her back. Luke leans over and snatches it from her. It's the attachment Allon forwarded to all employees. He keeps the ad, and looks at it with a sober expression. Meanwhile, the shopaholics group are getting the auction items ready. With crazed eyes, Haley jumps out of a cab, and dashes to join a queue of women standing outside the church building where the sale is taking place. Graham is on door duty. Allon is first in line. Graham demonstrates a red ensemble. D. Freak is on hats. Miss Korch produces the green scarf. Haley sends a text. Rebecca suddenly seems hesitant. She grabs back the scarf. She walks towards the blonde purchaser, and places it in her outstretched hands. She looks at her intriguingly. Jane and Graham look on proudly. The blonde, smiling coyly, waves the scarf at the applauding women. Rebecca looks distraught. Later, Graham counts the takings. Derek Smeath strides into his office. The staff watched him pass with po-faced curiosity. He looks back at them through his old-fashioned, black-rimmed specs. His pace slows. An employee, seeing him draw near, ducks into an unseen office. Smeath, scowling, wipes his mouth and turns to the door of his own office. Rebecca's at his desk. All the money is in jars of coins. It's the day of the wedding. A photographer on the decorated front steps of the church snaps the maids of honor arranging Suze's wedding train. One of them wears blue, the other pale green. The third is in red. A figure in pink hurries up. Suze turns around and looks coldly at Rebecca. Rebecca, wearing a pink tulle veil, looks imploringly at Suze. She turns towards the street, where the bag lady, standing with her trolley, twirls around in Rebecca's favorite pattern jacket. Suze's eyes mist over. With a relieved smile, Rebecca whips off her spotted shrug.",

It stands in a cabinet frame: A fine-looking young woman in archaic dress, with sharp, accusing black eyes. He turns the picture away and splashes liquor into his coffee. They drink. JOHN looks cautious. BIRDIE'S face falls; he takes another drink. JOHN puts his cup down and gets up. He heads for the door. JOHN runs up the bank, not looking back. He runs up the street close to Spoon's and stops dead. He is horrified by what he sees. GROUP SHOT through door-glass, from JOHN'S VIEW POINT PREACHER, WILLA and PEARL surround a little table. WALT stands by, puffing his pipe. ICEY in BACKGROUND, stirs fudge at a little soda-fountain stove. WILLA looks both moved and pleased. PEARL, shyly flirting with PREACHER, all but hides in WILLA'S skirts. PREACHER dandles PEARL'S doll on his knee as he talks. All the grownups are avid for his words, which we don't hear through the glass. We SHOOT THROUGH the DOOR; he quietly enters. They look casually to JOHN, and continue talking. OVER this JOHN ENTERS the SHOT and stands at the fringe of the GROUP, staring at PREACHER'S hands and at the doll. He hands the doll to PEARL. JOHN'S eyes follow the doll. PREACHER holds up both hands to JOHN. JOHN looks back at his hands. JOHN stands still. They are impressed in their different ways. Slight applause from the ADULTS. PREACHER takes PEARL, with her doll, onto his lap. He does a little take. His eyes twinkle palely. Something new enters his eyes; a game has begun between them. A tight silence. ICEY pours fudge into a buttered pan. Few men in proportion to women and children. We CENTER PREACHER. The women watch him and admire him. He gives WILLA the eye as we PAN to CENTER WILLA, who looks wooed and self-conscious. ICEY enters the SHOT and whispers and beckons WILLA and, as the singing continues, they leave the group and start towards a shade tree in MEDIUM GROUND, which we PAN TO CENTER. They walk; singers in BACKGROUND. WILLA nods. ICEY, looking ahead, is displeased. They sit on the bench, their backs to us, partly concealed by the tree trunk. They look around. ICEY and WILLA enter the SHOT, their backs to us. They sit on the bench, their back to us. The CHILDREN recede towards the river in BACKGROUND. WILLA meekly keeps her head down. Singing continues o.s. ICEY pivots and we PAN OVER her to CHILDREN by river. JOHN looks up from pebble-skimming and loosens his tie. His brow is furrowed. He skims another pebble.",
    "821": "Jacob cocks his head, then nods. Cal sighs heavily. Cal turns to Jacob. Jacob shakes his head and shrugs his shoulders. Cal gazes at him penetratingly. Cal raises his brows. Jacob looks at him directly and nods. Jacob nods and turns away. Cal turns and stares directly ahead. Jacob gets off his bar stool and soldiers out. He puts his hands in his pockets. Cal downs his shot. At school, all the kids have dressed smartly and lined up on a long row at the back of tiered seating constructed in the hall. Cal walks past the kids and over to the seating. He looks across the hall and spies Emily with Molly and Hannah. His eyes light up hopefully. He spots an empty seat next to Hannah. Then he sees Jacob stamping over a chair to take the seat next to her. Cal looks away. He heads upstairs and makes his way to a seat on the other side of the structure. Cal points to a seat between a man and woman who are chatting. The guy leans back so Cal can sit down. On the stage, Robbie in a suit, sits slumped at the end of a row. Cal eyes him and smiles softly. Robbie looks up and sees Jessica sitting with her parents. He looks down miserably. The principal walks onto the stage and up to the podium. Emily's jaw tightens. Kate takes the podium. Cal beams and claps proudly. Emily, Molly, Hannah and Jacob clap and cheer. Robbie gets up. Jessica smiles. Robbie plods over to the podium. Emily smiles and glances at Molly. Cal frowns. Emily's face falls. Robbie looks at Cal. Cal stands up. The audience all turn to him. Cal makes his way down the seating structure, squeezing past Bernie. Robbie's eyes start to find. Kate leans into the principal. Kate whispers something. The principal nods. Cal faces the audience. Kate puts her middle finger up at him. Cal turns to glance at Robbie. Emily's eyes brim. Tearfully, Emily smiles. Claire and Bernie glance at each other and smile. Emily's jaw slackens. Cal turns back to Robbie. Emily smiles. Emily looks down. Cal turns back to Robbie who beams. Jessica hangs her head, giggling. Emily laughs. Claire glances at Jessica with a worried look. Emily wipes away a tear. Cal puts his arm around Robbie. They leave the podium. In the school grounds, the kids and parents stand around chatting. Emily, Molly, Jacob and Hannah head over to Cal and Robbie. Hannah and Cal wrap their arms around each other. Cal eyes Jacob. Hannah steps back. Cal addresses Jacob. Jacob steps forward nervously. Cal holds out his hand. They shake. Jacob smiles. Cal slaps Jacob.",
    "824": "Cal studies himself in a mirror. He picks a shirt. They look through jackets. Cal is measured for a suit. He opens his wallet. Cal tries on a store trilby. In a jeans store. Jacob looks skywards. Jacob marched off. Cal hurries after him. Jacob turns back. Jacob shrugs, then slaps Cal's cheeks. In a hairdresser's. It's Cal's hairdresser. He steps out in his new garb. Jacob steps confidently over to Cal. Later, they sit in the bar together. Cal shrugs. Jacob raises his eyebrows. Cal is wearing a sharp blue suit. Jacob and Cal approach a group of women on a couch. Amy looks down awkwardly, then turns away. He points at Cal. She nods. Cal watches Jacob leave with all the different women, including two at the same time. A beautiful dark-haired woman with olive skin heads towards Cal. He can't take his eyes off her. She wears a low-cut black dress and makes a beeline for him. She shakes her silky hair from her face. Cal smiles. She reaches the table and presents Cal with the bill. They've racked up a bill of $837.57. Cal's smile disappears. She presses the button. The page comes out completely black. She screws her eyes shut. A guy spots her and stops. He comes into the room. In a classroom, a teacher writes on the blackboard. In the classroom, Robbie is texting on his mobile. At her locker, Jessica receives the text. Frowning, Jessica shakes her head. She texts back. Robbie receives the text. Robbie stands. A blonde girl smiles. He sits back down. Emily comes out of the assistant principal's office to Robbie, who is waiting. They traipse out together. Robbie chuckles softly. Emily smiles and puts an arm around his shoulder. In her office, Emily types at her computer. She glances up as Robbie glides past her desk on an office chair. He stops opposite her. She glances at a photo on the shelf, then looks at Robbie. Robbie shrugs. It's a photo of her and Cal. She lays it face down and turns back to Robbie. She frowns. She smiles, takes a deep breath and continues typing. She nods somberly. She knits her fingers together, and puts her head against her hands. David smiles. Robbie shakes his head disapprovingly. Emily heads off. David swaggers away, then pauses. He turns back and eyes Robbie, who stares back at him impassively. David heads back to Emily's office. He glances around and enters with a grin on his face. David sits. Robbie pulls a lever under his chair. It rises up, so he looks down on David. She frowns at David. David waves. Robbie places the photo of Emily and Cal firmly at the front of his mom's desk and marches out.",
    "826": "David is mowing the grass. He wears jeans and a white T-shirt with a deep V. He grins back at Emily, who licks her lips salaciously. Cal wakes with a jolt. He gets up. The ball falls from a tree in Emily's garden. Cal falls out of the branches of the tree. He remains stock still and regards the house intently. Cal waters the flower beds in the garden. He glances back at the house. He prunes one of the rose bushes. He treads over the lawn with shoes with long metal spikes on the bottom. He trims the hedge. He treads over the lawn the other way. He sidles across it. A security light comes on. He freezes. He makes a run for it. Cal plays catch with Robbie. They both wear baseball gloves. Robbie nods. Cal raises his brows, then squints at Robbie. Cal lobs the ball at Robbie, who catches it in his baseball glove and beams. He throws it back. Jessica's parents, ex-friend Bernie and Claire are there. Cal sits on a chair alone in a corridor, his brow furrowed. He stares ahead. He glances to his right as Emily approaches from the other direction. Cal stands. She smiles shyly. He beams brightly at her. They both take a seat on either side of a door in front of the lockers. They shuffle awkwardly in their seats. They both knit and unknit their fingers. Cal looks down at the floor. Cal nods and looks down. He shakes his head. Emily takes a deep breath. Cal smiles serenely. His expression becomes serious. Emily's eyes well with tears. Kate forces a grin. Kate yanks the door angrily. Kate closes her eyes. Kate takes a deep, calming breath. She stands and touches her temple gently. Emily smiles coldly and turns to face Cal. Emily gawks at him. He raises his brow but looks down. She opens and closes her mouth, and nods her head. Cal shakes his head and stares at his feet. He sighs. A gentle smile creeps across his face. Tearfully, Emily smiles. A crowd has gathered. Cal turns to Emily sheepishly. She glares at him. Cal hangs his head and shakes it. He looks up. His eyes dart around. Emily walks away. Cal turns to watch her go. Emily gets into her car and drives off. Bernie and Claire walk away. It starts to rain. Jacob sits alone in his smart, minimalist apartment, eating a bowl of cereal and studying the packet. A large black and white abstract painting hangs behind him. Emily drives through the night. At the wheel, she shakes her head in disbelief. She blinks and sighs heavily. Cal leans against his car outside the school and lets the rain soak him.",
    "827": "The gentle golden glow of a street light shimmers on the rain-slick road. People with umbrellas hurry into a restaurant. Hannah, her boyfriend, other colleagues and Liz sit around a table in the restaurant. Whilst her colleagues laugh, Liz signals to a waiter. Hannah looks disappointed. Liz gapes over at the couple, her eyes wide, her expression anxious. Hannah eyes her boyfriend searchingly. Hannah steps in close to him. He raises a hand. She grabs a guy's drink and gulps it. She heads off. Hannah marches out high-fiving Liz on the way. Hannah strides through the rain. In the bar, Jacob is flirting with a blonde 20-something woman. Frowning, Jacob turns and smiles at Hannah curiously. Rain drenched, she storms over to him, grabs his face in her hands and kisses him hard. Slowly, Jacob reaches around her waist. He pulls her to him and lifts her gently off the ground, still locked in a passionate embrace. After some time, Hannah pulls away and looks him straight in the eye. Jacob smiles happily. Hannah nods curtly and kisses him again. Jacob puts her back down. She drags him out of the bar. The woman he was flirting with earlier stares at them incredulously as they leave. Hannah stands in the living room of Jacob's apartment, watching the rain through the tall glass windows. Jacob pours liquor onto a sugar lump in a glass, then crushes the lump with a pestle. He pours in more liquor and some ice cubes. He grates some orange peel into the drink. A stylus lowers onto a record. Jacob goes into the living room carrying two drinks. Hannah stands in her knee-length black dress fidgeting nervously. He hands her the glass. She glugs down her drink at top speed. She cringes. She shakes her head. She grabs the other drink off Jacob and starts gulping that down. She gags. She hands back both empty glasses. Jacob heads over to a coffee table to put them down. Hannah does a nervous twirl. Jacob takes off his jacket and sits down. Jacob squeezes his hands into fists. He points to himself. He nods and smiles. He takes off his top to reveal a tanned, muscular torso with a six pack. Hannah scrutinizes him. He looks down at himself. She touches him. She gawks at him. He smiles smugly. She limbers up. She runs at him. He lifts her up. Her legs flop. Then she lifts them up. Slowly, he spins around, then stops. She lowers her legs. He lets her fall into his arms so she's pressed up against his body. He lets her slide gently down until her feet touch the floor. He presses his forehead against hers.",
    "828": "Clearly hypnotized by his move and his good looks, she forces herself to take a step back. Cal hurries into the bar. He surveys it, studying the bar and various men and women chatting and flirting with one another. Wet from the rain, he steps further into the bar. In his bedroom, Jacob leans over Hannah, who lies back on the bed. He kisses her. He kisses her again. He leans down to kiss her again. Still wearing his trousers, he lies between her open legs. He pulls away from her. He flops onto the bed. In the garage, Hannah sits in the massage chair, wrapped in a sheet. They lie on the bed laughing. He smiles. Jacob licks his lips. He nods. Jacob has fallen asleep with his glass in his hand. Hannah takes the glass, and puts it on a chest of drawers, then pulls the sheet up over him. She gazes at him and smiles. She props herself up in bed, leans over and kisses him on the cheek. Then lies back down resting her head on his shoulder, nuzzles into him and closes her eyes. Cal's brow is knitted as he talks on the phone. Cal sits at the bar drinking on his own. The bartenders are cleaning up. Cal looks over at a balding guy opposite him and of a similar age. The guy sips his drink through a straw. He notices Cal eying him and raises his brows in acknowledgment. With a sad expression, Cal picks up his mobile. In a restaurant, Emily's phone rings. She hangs up. Heading back to her house, David leans in and kisses her. The door opens. They both nod awkwardly. David glances at Jessica and smiles. He heads off. Jessica has her arms folded and grins. Emily heads in. Jessica shrugs and shakes her head. Jessica strides off. Emily goes in, and shuts the door behind her. She has a clutch bag in one hand and a bunch of flowers in the other. She tosses the flowers on a chest of drawers in the hall. Robbie sits on the stairs, watching her. But she passes without noticing it. Someone pedals furiously on a bike. At home, in her room, Jessica gets out a camera from her drawer. He has the bunch of flowers with him. Studying her reflection in a mirror, she dons mascara. It's Robbie pedaling through the night. Jessica brushes out her long, dark hair, and sweeps eyeshadow across her lids. She applies a peachy-colored lipstick to her lips, presses them together, then pouts in the mirror. She puts the camera on a shelf in her room. The light on it flashes. She stands a few feet away in her dressing gown.",
    "829": "She turns to face the camera and undoes the ties on her dressing gown. She takes a deep breath and drops the gown to the floor. She does a big, cheesy grin as the camera takes a picture, then frowns and shakes her head. She sets up the camera again and tries a variety of poses, attempting to be sexy. She rips a cute kitten poster off the wall. She prints out one of the photos, puts it in an envelope, and writes Cal's name on the envelope. She stops decorating the envelope. She opens the front door to find a bunch of lilies. Jessica picks up the bunch of flowers and reads the note. She shakes her head and stares out into the night. Cal is doing guerrilla gardening again. Cal puts the tools back in the shed. From in the house. Cal turns towards the house. He watches as Molly and Robbie hurry to the table. Emily traipses through the house to another room. She picks up a phone and dials. In the garden, Cal takes his phone out. Cal eyes Emily nervously. Cal watches Emily, who is not in the basement at all. Emily smiles. Cal's eyes are full of tenderness. Emily hangs up and looks down sadly. Cal hangs up, still watching her from the garden. Emily heads back to the kids. The wheels of a trolley rotate on a shiny floor. Cal is in a DIY store with Robbie and Molly. Cal picks up a wooden trellis. Jacob is in a wine shop. Jacob turns to Hannah. He pinches her nose, then kisses her. They head off. In Jessica's bedroom, her mom, Claire, is putting away clean laundry. As she puts something in her drawer, she spots the envelope. She takes it out to see Cal's name written on it in big letters. She opens the envelope and partially pulls out the photo from inside. She gasps, horrified. Emily drives her SUV along her leafy, suburban street and turns into her driveway. Robbie is standing in the front garden. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. He waves. Her brow furrowed, Emily stares at him. Claire comes down the stairs in a state of shock. Bernie is sitting on the couch, watching TV. Bernie takes a swig of Coca-Cola. Claire grabs Bernie's shoulder from behind the couch and hands him the envelope. Bernie gives Claire a little frown and turns back to the TV. Absentmindedly, he opens the envelope and glances down at the photo. He freezes. There are several photos in there. He goes through them. His jaw goes slack. Jessica, who is lying on the floor nearby, spots the envelope. Bernie races her from the couch to the door.",
    "830": "A black sedan pulls into an empty car park in the early morning light. A couple. At work. A warehouse. He's in the toilet. In Harken's office. Harken pours Nick a big measure of whiskey from a cut-glass decanter and hands it to him. The tumbler is nearly full. Nick frowns. Nick stares. Nick starts for the door. Harken watches from behind his desk as Nick picks up the tumbler of whiskey and glugs it all in one go. It spills down his chin as he drains the glass. At the dentist's, bearded Dale is assisting his attractive boss, Julia, with a patient. A spraying device. She sprays Dale's crotch. Julia stands up. She administers gas. Kurt's boss, Jack, opens his car door. Jack drives away from the chemical company. Kurt spins around. Kurt is with Dale. Kurt spots a hot chick. The premises of Comnidyne. Staff are gathered in a meeting room. Nick leafs through documents. Nick puts down his documents. Nick winks at a colleague. Nick drags Harken through the office by his tie. Nick smashes him through a window. He plummets onto the roof of a parked car. Colleagues clap and cheer. Nick snaps to from his reverie. Nick chases after him. Harken stares blankly. Nick glares stony-faced as Harken creases up. Harken turns back. Harken steps closer. Harken turns and walks away. Brow furrowed, Nick looks at the floor. Kurt shows up for work at Pellit and Sons. As he takes off his jacket, Jack's son, Bobby, scoots back in his black leather office chair and glowers. He's short with a goatee, a high forehead and wispy, thin comb-over. He scoots back into the office. Kurt goes through to him. A guy in a wheelchair. She's practically nude. Julia locks Dale in. She's wearing nothing but lacy knickers, stockings, and suspenders beneath an open lab coat. She smirks. He sidles nervously to a chair and sits down. She slowly runs her fingers along his beard and then his chest. She clutches his balls. She lets go. He frantically rattles the handle of the locked door. He exits. Night, at the bar. Kenny takes the cash they offered and goes. Dale is filling out a form in the dentist's office when he suddenly has his eyes covered. Julia gives smiley blonde Stacy a hug. They turn to a troubled-looking Dale, who forces a smile. Off they go. Stacey is gassed. Julia dives for Dale's crotch. A tablet computer. She holds it up. Compromising photos of Julia faking a variety of sex acts with an unconscious Dale. Doggy style. She winks and leaves the room. Exasperated, Dale's eyes rove in thought. His car screeches to a halt, mounting the curb as he parks outside Nick's place.",
    "831": "He goes inside. Nick and Kurt are playing video games. The next night, a laid-back Nick strolls along a walkway at a Travel Inn. Clean-shaven with short, dark brown hair, he wears jeans and a shirt with the sleeves rolled up. He comes to a room and knocks gently on the door. Dale answers, leaving the security chain fastened. Nick grabbed him. Dale and Kurt run to the window and see a man dressed in black get out of a black muscle car. Kurt and Dale share an excited look and clench their fists. Kurt pauses to compose himself, then opens the door and says. Kurt points. The sharp-suited man wears dark glasses. He enters the room. He takes off his shades. He throws a plastic sheet down. The guys are in Kurt's car. They drive into a rough neighborhood. They near a bar. They enter the bar. It's bustling with shady clientele. Kurt nods to a musclebound guy as they head to the bar. To a Latino and, finally, to the heavyset, black barman. The barman bridles. A guy eyes them as they leave. The guy from inside. They follow the black guy, who has a shaven head and several tattoos. Jones glares at them. Harken smashes his office wall down with a sledgehammer. His extended office now complete, Harken removes a strip of clear plastic from a plaque on the door and buffs it with his sleeve. Nick glowers. Nick withdraws money from his bank account. Balding Bobby Pellitt is partying hard with three Thai hookers in skimpy underwear. He snorts a line of cocaine from one's stomach. They writhe in orgiastic abandonment. He's in his office. Kurt's in the main office. He frowns as Bobby's bare torso presses up against the window. At home, Kurt raids a private stash of money. Now in the main office, Bobby looks over at Kurt and gives him the finger as he smooches with one of the women. Kurt frowns. Bobby's shirt is open, exposing his bloated stomach. He holds up Hank's handicapped parking pass. At the dentist, Julia licks the back of Dale's neck, then sucks his left earlobe and jams her tongue in his ear. He furrows his brow as she tweaks his nipples. She grins, then slaps his ass. Wearing a black hoodie and dark glasses, Dale withdraws money from a cash point in a gas station mini-mart. The guys sit opposite Jones at a table in a dingy bar. They push a large briefcase towards him, and he opens it. It's empty, apart from a small bundle of bank notes. He snaps it shut. Jones sips his drink. He beckons them closer, and they lean forward. He reaches inside his jacket.",
    "832": "The guys consider for a moment. Nick stares down, brow creased. He takes the briefcase. Nick is at work. Harken harangues an employee within earshot of Nick. Nick takes a pen and slides it down his throat, causing himself to vomit into his wastepaper basket. Nick wipes his mouth. Nick picks up the plastic bin and heads out. The guys drive down a leafy, suburban street. They gaze over at a large house. Kurt grins. Night falls. Chewing on snacks, they all share a look. They get out of the car. They quickly hide as Bobby's garage door swings open. An orange Pontiac Trans Am tears out and drives off down the street. Nick and Kurt roll under the slowly closing garage door. Dale bashes into it. The door opens again. In the house. Tasteless artifacts. A deep tray of cocaine about the size of a CD case. He drops it. A cocaine cloud hangs in the air. Kurt enters the bedroom where there's a large Japanese style portrait of Bobby brandishing nunchucks. He pockets something from the dresser. Nick, who wears a short sleeved T shirt, watches Dale pick up the tray. Kurt uses his sleeve gloves to turn the light on in Bobby's on-suite bathroom. He spots Bobby's toothbrush. He takes it from his holder, slides it down his ass crack and has a good scrub. He puts it back. A Dustbuster vacuum. Dale's hoody is dusted with cocaine. He tries to sweep it off. Kurt picks up Bobby's razor. He pops it down the back of his trousers. In the open plan living space, Nick dumps the contents of the Dustbuster into the cocaine tray. The tray is now full of dust, cocaine and debris. Nick is stony-faced. Kurt finds dental floss. Dale sniffs and flexes his jaw. Kurt finishes up in the bathroom. He turns the light off and leaves. In the living room. Kurt slaps Dale. Dale rolls his shoulders. Street lamps illuminate the darkened street as they drive on. They pull up outside Harken's palatial home and park in the shadows. Approaching the front door. They climb over a low hedge and peer in through the windows. Something catches Nick's eye. He takes a rock from a plant pot by the door. He tosses it to Kurt. Nick takes a key from the rock. They enter the spacious hallway. Hanging in the lounge is a portrait of Harken with his wife and their cat. The cat leaps onto Nick's shoulder and bolts. Dale sings along to the radio in the car. Kurt and Nick start across the landing, where life size cat figurines rest on small podiums. A porcelain cat's face hangs on the wall.",
    "833": "The real cat leaps from a sideboard. A photograph. He reorientates the phone screen and throws a food wrapper out of the car window. Harken jogs up in a mismatched designer track suit. Preoccupied with his iPhone, Dale doesn't see him. Harken picks up the wrapper and glowers. Dale spins around. Harken collapses. Dale plunges an EpiPen injection into Harken's chest. Kurt looks out of a bedroom window. They see Dale pounding Harken's chest. Kurt unwittingly drops Bobby's mobile as they hurry out. He drives the long needle into Harken's neck as Kurt and Nick leg it out of the house. A car pulls up. He comes to. She kisses Dale. Harken snatches the EpiPen. Nick and Kurt walk together. Dale screeches up in Kurt's Volkswagen. Traffic streams along a highway as night turns to day. The guys stride down a supermarket aisle like they mean business. Nick finds rat poison. He compares two brands, Rat Attack and Rat Out. He opts for the Rat Attack. Kurt tries out some binoculars. He hones in on a tight backside and smiles. Lowering the binoculars, he sees that the ass belongs to a guy holding a yucca plant. Kurt blanches and returns the binoculars to the shelf. Dale happens upon jars of peanuts. There's an offer on, three for one, $2.49. He fills his basket with jars. The guys leave. Dale is laden with three carryout bags of nuts. The guys get in their separate cars. Kurt reverses his white sedan, making way for Dale and Kurt who close in on the same narrow gap and stop. Kurt falters, then drives in front of Nick and circles the two cars to bring up the rear. As Nick drives off to the right, Dale goes to turn left, blocking Kurt who brakes jerkily. The sun sets beyond the city limits and day turns to night. The guys park outside the houses of their assigned bosses. Dale waits outside Harken's. Two Thai sex workers leave Bobby's. One was a man dressed as a woman. Bobby goes back indoors. Kurt spies Julia through binoculars. She goes to the boot of her car. As she bends over to retrieve a bag, Kurt ogles her backside. As sultry Julia heads indoors, Kurt's phone rings. Seeing a light come on in Harken's place, he shuts the player and pays attention. In a walk-in wardrobe, Harken sniffs one of his wife's dresses and roots through her handbag. He walks into the lounge. Harken's gray mackerel striped tabby cat is stretched out under a chair, purring up Bobby's phone. Harken grabs the phone and brings up a profile of its owner, complete with name, photograph and details. Dale ducks down in his car seat as Harken drives past in his SUV.",
    "834": "Nick watches from his car as Bobby jumps around by the window in silk pajamas, flailing a pair of nunchucks. He considers for a moment. Carrying a jar of peanuts, Dale sneaks through Harken's house. He puts a light on in the bedroom and goes to the door of the on-suite bathroom. He opens it and the cat leaps out at him. He falls against the shower. He picks up a bottle of shampoo. His eyes move between the shampoo and the peanuts. Nick sees Bobby's bedroom lights go out. He heaves a sigh and looks at his box of Rat Attack. He answers his phone. Bobby answers the door to Harken, who hands him his phone and shoots him in the chest. He ducks down in his car as Harken flees the scene in his 4X4. Nick yanks his seatbelt, but it won't budge. Panicking, Dale tidies Harken's shower soaps and legs it with the peanuts. A speed camera snaps a picture of Nick as he hurtles through a red light. The guys meet in a bar. They get in Nick's car. A squad car has blocked them in. A black officer strolls over and taps on Nick's window. The cop peers in. They're in the back of the cop car. At the precinct. Dale, Kurt and the two detectives stare at Nick. Nick frowns. Kurt's face drops as he recalls scrubbing his backside with Bobby's toothbrush. The guys find Jones drinking in the bar. Jones cocks an eyebrow and shoots them a look. They huddle closer. Jones smirks and sips his drink. The guys ride in Kurt's car. He drives up outside Harken's house. They sneak into Harken's house. Kurt squats by her. Rhonda smiles at him. Harken enters. Harken stomps out of the room. Kurt heads for Rhonda. Nick and Dale. Kurt emerged from the bathroom with Rhonda close behind. In the car. Cops. Kurt drives off. Harken rams them in his SUV. He rams them again. They weave around a car. Julia is naked in a bath. Kurt accelerates. Harken rams their back end side-on to spin them around. Julia masturbates. They swerve wildly through traffic. Kurt hangs a sharp left into an empty street. Harken smashes into them in his 4x4. The airbags go off. Harken taps on the window with his revolver. Kurt lowers his window. They get out. He holds them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself. The gun. Harken sinks to the floor and clutches his leg. Dale tosses the gun down. The guys high-five. Harken goes for Kurt, but Nick smacks him hard in the face, knocking him to the ground. Luke smirks. He pats her. She pulls the patient's trousers down.",
    "838": "Diana helps Sandy up and pushes him aside as the car accelerates. Diana rolls up the windshield and falls to the pavement. Pushing the airbag away, the skiptracer sees a squad car speeding straight at him. As he turns, a car T-bones him. Sandy kneels over Diana. Sandy's face tenses. She startles awake. She punches him in the throat. Sandy flails backward. Sitting up, Diana sees a squad car speed by, then glances behind them. Squad cars surround the skiptracer. An officer hops out with his pistol drawn. The skiptracer sits back, dazed. They arrest him as Sandy and Diana scurry away unseen. They exit the overpass through a construction gate and down a staircase. Now, in a parking lot, Sandy and Diana stagger toward the Chevy Caprice. He looks off as she enters the car. Now, with St. Louis behind them, Sandy cruises along with a joyful grin as Diana sleeps. Later, the sun rises in a pale orange sky. In broad daylight, Sandy drives through rural farmland. He checks the fuel gauge on a country highway. Sandy keeps his tired eyes on the road. Glancing over, he startles as Diana sleeps with her glazed eyes wide open. Sandy gently closes her eyelids and her head falls into his lap. He yanks her up by the hair and Diana's mouth hangs open. Our view quickly rises into the sky, following the sun through a full day. At sunset, they cruise toward the Denver skyline. At night, Sandy parks the beat-up car outside his apartment and enters with Diana. His daughters run into his arms. Sandy's brow rises at his approaching wife. They share a long, loving kiss as Diana enters, her sheepish eyes averted to the floor. She connects eyes with Trish. The young girls extend their hands. Diana shifts her gaze to Sandy, who flashes a grin. Now, the Pattersons eat dinner with Diana. Trish looks at her husband, who glances at their guest and takes a bite. Sitting across from Diana, Sandy's daughters stare warily at her. Diana smears potatoes on her forehead. Jessie plops food onto her forehead with a fork. Later, Trish dries dishes in the kitchen. Diana timidly walks in and puts her hand on the counter. She removes it and straightens. Diana shifts her weight and steps closer. She outlines her groin and chest. Trish awkwardly blinks at her. Diana starts to go, then turns back. She gazes earnestly at Diana. The redhead leaves the kitchen. Watching her go, Trish clutches a plate and drying cloth. Her gaze wanders to the floor. Now, in bed, Sandy lies on his side. He rolls to his right and sidles up next to his wife, who lightly touches his shoulder.",
    "840": "He looks at his phone. His co-worker enters. Sandy watches the man leave. Later, he approaches his co-worker in the garage. More co-workers step out and include Sandy in a circle. Wide-eyed, Sandy glances at his co-workers. Staring down, a smile creeps across Sandy's face as he considers. He raises his gaze and nods. Now, Sandy's daughter kicks a soccer ball off a field. Her mother cheers from the sidelines. Sandy approaches his wife. She jumps back with surprise. He speaks to her with his hands gently holding her face. Holding her hand over her mouth, she jumps with joy and gives Sandy a hug. He smiles and lifts her off her feet. Now, the plump identity thief sips from a straw as she rides down an escalator. At a store, she tries on a ring. Now, in cosmetics. Two women laugh as they watch the cosmetics girl apply makeup to the redhead. At a cell phone kiosk. The man smiles. At the center of the mall, a mother and daughter sit on a jet ski. The redhead buys it. At a Brookstone, she sleeps on a massage chair with her open mouth drooling. An employee approaches. He pokes her. She sorts through a stack of Sandy's cards. Now, Sandy and his daughters brush their teeth. In his car, Sandy smiles and bobs his head as he taps his thumbs on the steering wheel. He glances down at the dashboard, where the low-gas light blinks on. His smile fades. He pulls into a gas station. At the pump, Sandy puts in his credit card. Holding the card to his mouth, he breathes on the strip, then wipes the card on his jacket. Sandy pushes the card in again. Inside, the attendant stands behind a clear protective glass, talking on an earpiece. The attendant swipes the card. He talks into his earpiece. The attendant points to his earpiece. He slides Sandy the cut card. Now, in Sandy's car. A police car pulls up behind him. Now, officers emerge from the cruiser. Sandy peeks out the window as one of the officers approaches. The other officer stands back with his hand by his sidearm. The detective touches his phone. Now, the detective returns with a file. He hands Sandy the thief's haggard mug shot. He leaves Sandy shaking his head. Now, the family man parks a Subaru. He enters a modern office and passes a company logo. He goes to a glass door and pushes it open. He admires his new office as his former coworker, now new boss, approaches. Four cops stand at reception. Later, as men put lids on boxes, the lead detective approaches Sandy and his boss. Sandy faces his boss, who turns to the detective.",
    "843": "Lifting a glass container, he casually pours out the Barbicide disinfectant and drops it on the floor. He flips open a Zippo lighter and strikes it on his leg. Her mouth hangs open. She points to the desk. At night, in Sandy's car. Smiling, Diana applies makeup. He faces forward with a stern gaze. He shakes his head. Now, as they enter a restaurant, a young red-haired waitress greets them. The smiling waitress walks away. He signals the waitress. The waitress turns. The shocked waitress eyes Sandy. She glares at Sandy and leaves. He looks upward. The waitress returns with a mound of food. She pulls her thumb from Sandy's soup. As the waitress leaves, Diana takes a large bite of ribs. Now, in a motel, they approach the front desk. She leaves. Diana enters The Foxhole. A husky bearded man in a cowboy hat notices her. He nods to himself as Diana sips her green beverage. He turns away. Looking up, she notices his Mercedes car key and thick gold ring on his pinky. The man smiles. He sits beside her. Removing his hat, the man extends a hand. He wears a turquoise bolo. They toast and down their shots. Now, they sit at a table with several empty shot glasses. As they drink another shot, Diana slaps the table. Sandy enters and scans the room. Smiling, he approaches their table. She points at Chuck. She places a hand on Chuck's shoulder. Big Chuck nods. She leads Chuck to the dance floor. Diana and Big Chuck shimmy. With her eyes on Sandy, Diana pinches Chuck's nipples through his shirt. Spinning around, Diana bends over and Big Chuck twirls his cowboy hat behind her like riding a bronco. She stands and they continue dancing with her eyes on Sandy, who motions toward the door. Facing Chuck, Diana shimmies in place. She suddenly drops into a split with her face by his crotch. Big Chuck points finger guns at Sandy, as Diana dances on the floor. Now, they enter a motel room. Sandy sets down his wallet. Chuck walks into Diana's arms. Big Chuck whips off his belt. He swings the belt up from his crotch like an elephant's trunk, hitting Sandy in the face. Chuck gives him a final belt slap, then drops it. He aims a finger gun at his crotch and unbuttons his pants. Chuck drops his pants. She spanks Big Chuck as he rapidly knocks his knees. Diana swipes the anxiety pills. Stumbling back, Chuck pulls up his pants. Big Chuck grabs her hips from behind. They fall backwards onto the bed. Big Chuck spreads his legs in the air. He sits up. Diana drops a pill into his cup, then pours two drinks as he twitches drunkenly.",
    "844": "She empties out a mini bottle and bites the top off another. Shaking his cup, she turns with a playful smile and sashays back and forth. Diana's smile quickly fades and she sets down the drinks. Diana blinks her moist eyes. He points to her blue gingham blouse. Big Chuck tenses his face and nods. Diana glances off with a sweet smile, as Chuck slowly removes his cowboy hat. He gazes into her eyes. She leaps on him. Sandy listens from the bathroom and rubs his face. Diana grips the bed as Chuck thrusts behind her. Sandy covers his ears. Falls onto her back. Sandy turns on the shower. Sandy ties a towel around his ears as Diana yanks on Chuck's neck with his belt. Now, she holds his legs from behind and bounces rapidly. Sandy buries his head in his hands. Lying on the floor, Sandy kicks the wall. Diana spots Big Chuck's wallet and car keys on a small table and her smile fades. She finishes buttoning her shirt and glances back at the sleeping man. She notices Sandy's wallet and phone by the room key on the dresser. Stepping forward, she collects Sandy's things and grabs Big Chuck's belt off the floor. The plump criminal shifts in place. Sandy's eyes shoot open and he pulls the towel off his head. Outside, she staggers away. Sandy yanks on the bathroom door handle. On the other side, Big Chuck's belt holds it closed. She crosses the quiet motel parking lot with a backpack in hand. Diana slings the bag over her shoulder and it slides off as she arrives at Sandy's car. Sliding into the driver's seat, Diana tosses the bag into the next seat and places Sandy's phone in the center console. She leans forward and inserts the key into the ignition. Sitting back, Diana pulls a small amount of cash from Sandy's wallet and sifts through the bills. Grabbing Sandy's cell phone, she admires the photo of his smiling daughters. Diana holds the phone to her ear. Tensing her face, Diana fights back tears. The thief covers her eyes, then shifts her pained gaze around. Diana closes her eyes and places both hands on the wheel. Removing one, she rubs her forehead. Now, she enters the motel room and puts Sandy's belongings back on the dresser. Sandy crashes through the bathroom door. He quickly kneels. She moves across the room with the ice bucket and sets it on the bedside table. Taking off the backpack, Diana lies down next to Big Chuck. She takes all the blankets, revealing his naked rear end. Sandy stands up and eyes the room. The next morning, Sandy waits by the car as Diana approaches with sunglasses and disheveled hair.",
    "845": "At the front desk, the attendant hands him a clipboard. Outside, Diana opens the car door. As Sandy pours himself a cup of coffee, the brown utility van pulls into the motel parking lot. The skiptracer walks around and sees Diana sitting in the open passenger side. Inside, Sandy stirs his coffee while the skiptracer pulls Diana from the car. He notices the abduction through the window. Sandy runs outside as the skiptracer pushes Diana into the van. The skiptracer locks the door and hurries to the wheel. Sandy runs over. Sandy watches the van speed off. He quickly shuts the passenger-side door and gets behind the wheel of his rental. Sandy backs out of his parking spot and speeds away from the motel. On a narrow country road, the skiptracer talks on his cell phone. Sandy comes up on the van. He moves into the oncoming lane and pulls up beside the van. Diana opens a window. Spotting an oncoming car, Sandy hits the brakes and swerves behind the van. Diana pushes against the gated partition. Sandy pulls up beside the van again. The van speeds toward an intersection's red light. Cars whiz by as the van turns sharply. Sandy follows, barely dodging the oncoming vehicles. His sedan skids up alongside another car and he peels away. A two lane highway. Sandy speeds up beside the skiptracer's van. He swerves at Sandy, sending him into a grassy median. Sandy recovers on the other side, facing oncoming traffic. Speeding cars swerve out of his way. Guardrails lie on both sides of the road trapping Sandy with the oncoming traffic. The skiptracer peers out of his window, watching the businessmen at their numerous vehicles. An 18-wheeler speeds towards Sandy and he swerves toward the median. The sedan launches off a mound of dirt and soars through the air. It lands on its tires in the grass and Sandy rejoins the van on the right side of the road. In the van, Diana pounds a cylinder against the partition lock and breaks through. The skiptracer elbows her stomach and holds her back. Diana punches him in the throat and he falls limply against the steering wheel. Sandy slows down and lightly hits the back panel of the van, barely nudging it. Diana notices a merge up ahead. Sandy eyes the runaway van. Gripping the steering wheel, he takes a breath. He speeds into the side of the van causing it to flip over. Sandy stares wide-eyed as the van continues to flip into the median. He stops the car and watches the van land right side up. Sandy unbuckles his seatbelt and slowly emerges from the car. In slow motion, he hurries toward the van with his mouth dropped open.",
    "847": "Sandy reaches into his pockets and comes up empty. He looks at Diana. He walks back to the bench and sighs. Sandy shakes his head. Diana looks away somberly, as Sandy gazes down at his pants. He sits beside her. He kicks off the shoes and looks down. He pulls out a wad of cash. At the salvage yard. Now, they pull out of the lot in an old, run-down Chevy Caprice. At the bus station, the skiptracer limps in and takes a sip from the juice pouch. Tossing it on the ground he walks over to the ticket booth. The attendant recoils from the skiptracer's bloody face. He looks around the empty station, then sees the attendant with the hand out. The skiptracer twists his wrist. He writes it down and hands the skiptracer a slip of paper. The skiptracer holds his gun up to the window. As he backs away, a bullet rips through his neck and shatters the glass. Paolo's thugs approach with silenced pistols. The skiptracer holds his neck wound as Julian takes the address. Maricol looks at the attendant and holds her finger up to her lips. The booth window falls apart. Now, Sandy and Diana cruise down the highway toward a bridge. In the car, Sandy's hardened gaze fixes ahead as Diana sits on her side facing him. He swerves the car, smashing her head on the window. He swerves again. Later, they cruise over the Mississippi River into St. Louis. The Gateway Arch stands tall over the city. At a gas station, Sandy fills up as Diana emerges from the car. Sandy looks up thoughtfully. Diana falls in the lobby. The security guard hurries over. As he rubs Diana's leg, a businessman enters the executive fitness center. Sandy glances around, then slips inside the closing door. Sandy watches the man place his suit in a locker as the guard rubs Diana's butt. The businessman closes his locker with the code and leaves. Sandy quickly approaches. Sandy puts in a code and opens the locker. He glances back with a smile. Now, in a dapper suit and red tie, he strolls through the offices with Diana. They spot a balding man behind a desk. Diana and Sandy exchange a look. She faces the man, shielding her mouth with her hand. He lifts his phone. Diana backs away. He stares into Ken's eyes with his brow raised. On a security monitor, Sandy enters the code. Our view lowers inside the records room as a glass door and metal gate slide open. Sandy and Diana briskly enter. Pulling equipment from her bag, Diana hard-lines her credit card burner into the network as Sandy searches the shelves. He finds Cornish's records in a box.",
    "848": "Dark clouds cover half of the bright moon. A figure hurtles dying towards the ground. Long, bony fingers caress the street as the black-tied figure rises to its feet. The figure is a slight man in his 30's, blood streaks the right side of his face. He has blond cropped hair and a thick color. He stares at lights in the sky which go out. Rain falls. He throws himself against the wall and huddles beside it. He holds out a broad-bladed dagger and points it in the direction of the dog which barks from behind the wire fence. The man rips open his black top, revealing a thin, toned body with tattoos and blood in line with the streak on his face. He walks towards the dog in its pound, raises the dagger above his head and brings it down with great force. Bright light shines on him and a blue light ring falls over him and opens the collar around his neck. It falls to the ground. Rain washes blood across the ground and into a drain. Inside the building, a man in a suit and carrying a torch walks along between stacking shelves, some covered with cellophane. Under a skylight, he steps on a toy. He bends down and picks it up. The man in the black coat jumps through the skylight onto him, knocking him and his torch to the floor. The man from the sky goes to a grubby men's room. Removes his coat and opens a first aid box. He uses a thread and a bent needle to stitch a nasty wound on his back. Flesh has been torn away at shoulder level. He watches his reflection in a mirror as he sows. His bloody hand grasps the sink, as his blood drips on the floor. Now dressed, he marches to a door and removes a chain. He switches on lights in an armory. Dressed in black, shirt, trousers and light coat. He picks up two assault rifles with grenade launchers. Then a selection of assault and sniper rifles. He walks out of the armory with two bags in his hands. He reaches a door with a metal bar across it. Two cops, Burton and Estevez, drive along a downtown street. The burlier of the two, Burton, glances out as they pass people on the sidewalk. Burton holds up his fingers in the shape of a gun. A door explodes just in front of them. And a man is hurled into the air. A hole in the shape of a cross has been made in the building. And they watch, as the man from the sky, steps into the flaming surround. Burton gets out and draws his gun.",
    "849": "The possessed clamber and crawl over the van. They scratch the windscreen with their fingernails. Charlie picks up a machine pistol. Michael stops her. Michael takes the machine pistol and picks up an assault rifle. Bob and Jeep pull the planks away from the door and open it. Michael walks out, guns blazing. Possessed drop dead. A couple run at Michael. He batters them away. He pulls out two pistols and shoots some more. He gives another one a kick, shoots him, and lays into a couple more by the van. Michael takes a nozzle from a fuel pump, sprays gas over the back of the van, and lights it. The possessed flee as the van is engulfed in flames. Inside, Audrey cowers fearfully. She moves over to the passenger seat. Michael smashes the driver's window. He grabs her hand, yanks her out. They run off. The van blows up. They're thrown into the diner. Charlie fills a jug with water and turns to see the boy. She drops the jug. He slashes the front of her shirt with a big kitchen knife. Charlie recoils and holds up a metal tray. The boy stabs at Charlie. The knife sticks in the tray. His hands slide down the blade. The knife drops to the floor. The boy stares at his bloody hands. Charlie lowers the tray and kicks him over. Michael clambers in front of Charlie and aims his gun. The boy's disappeared. The lights go out, plunging the place into darkness. Michael runs over to where the boy was. Bob and Jeep come over, shining a torch on the ground. There's a trail of blood. Jeep aims his torch beam up and follows a trail of bloody hand prints across the ceiling. The trail stops dead. The boy appears behind Bob and tries to throttle him. Michael grabs the boy and hurls him away. Jeep shoots him. Charlie bends forward, grimacing. Michael stares at him. Michael holds Charlie's hands. Audrey at them both. Bob steps out onto the roof to join Jeep. Michael keeps holding Charlie. Her mouth gapes. The building shakes. Up on the roof, Bob and Jeep stare out into the darkness. Bright light flashes all around, illuminating hundreds of possessed standing motionless, staring at the diner. Charlie's mouth gapes. Audrey gently lifts the baby. Smiling incredulously, Audrey wraps the bloody child in a towel and offers it to Charlie. A tear rolls down Charlie's cheek. Charlie faces away from the child. Audrey carries the baby over to Sandra, who stares at it, frowning. Smiling, Sandra nods. Behind her back, Sandra twists her hands within the ropes bound around them. Audrey and Michael. He shakes his head. Sitting behind Charlie, Michael leans to her with a sincere expression.",
    "85": "JOHN turns his back and looks out the window beside bureau. JOHN throws the hairbrush, striking PREACHER's head. He is sure now PEARL knows. As PREACHER's hand locks the door. WILLA is in outdoor clothes and is not dressed for work in the parlor. WILLA enters, her back to us; she stops. She smiles benignly. WILLA keeps smiling. Still smiling, shaking her head as in disbelief, WILLA makes for house as PEARL screams. Narrow screen, same set-up as in earlier corridor scene, PREACHER and WILLA. Their eyes meet. He turns. WILLA is calm and immobile with the ecstasy of a martyr. PREACHER hits her across the mouth. He has heard the VOICE and starts to move out of CLOSE SHOT. He has moved over to the coat on back of chair. His hand goes into the pocket and brings the knife out. It is the same coat, and pocket, as in the wedding-night scene. He pulls down the blind. He moves toward the bed. INSERT -- PREACHER's HAND AND KNIFE It clicks open. As he raises his arm to strike. He is scrubbing out an ice cream container on the back porch. He looks up and moves towards her. WALT ENTERS SHOT with pipe. They enter the kitchen. WALT clucks his tongue. WALT moves towards kitchen cabinet. He pours, snaps it down; weak-defiance. He looks towards o.s. He sits at a table, his back towards us, mumbling over his Bible. He closes his Bible and turns to them with weepy eyes and a brave little smile. ICEY smiles sideways. ICEY is happy to let her mouth fall open and let out a gasp. We PAN, with slowly streaming weeds, and bring in WILLA in close profile; the current, coming from behind her, drifts her long hair across her throat. She is in profile as before. It descends, and catches on the windshield, and the line tautens; then tugs. We start to follow the line up. We continue to follow the line up, and bring in, close, the stern of BEN HARPER's skiff. He sits back, tugging unconcernedly at the line. Then he leans over to see what's wrong. As he peers over side. We start moving before he does. LOW CAMERA; full figure. We TILT to frame him from the waist downward and follow close behind him. As he leaves the tree and walks along the side of the house; we TILT DOWNWARD and CLOSE IN, to follow only his feet; he steps past a tiny cellar window and we PAN and TIGHTEN IN CLOSE ON IT, into. Their noses are flat against the glass; their cheeks touch; their window isn't quite big enough to hold both their heads. It is on the ground; we don't see their chins.",
    "851": "They deflect off Gabriel's steel breastplate. Gabriel rises into the air and swings his mace, crashing it into furniture. Michael wallops. Gabriel leaps over his wing and gets swept with a machine pistol. Gabriel shoves the spike in the middle of his mace into the barrel of the gun. Michael shots and is blown back against the wall. Gabriel attacks. Gabriel slams the mace against the wall. Michael clutches the shaft of the mace. Gabriel sets the spiked end spinning. He pushes it towards Michael's face. Michael shoves it away. And Gabriel punches him. Michael punches Gabriel, grabs the overhead TV, and hurls it at Gabriel. Gabriel punches Michael to the floor. Gabriel grabs Michael by the throat, lifts him up, and punches him. Michael wallops him back and twists his arm. He flings Gabriel over and kicks him in the face. Gabriel forces Michael over a worktop and pins him down. He wields a hammer. Michael dodges the blow. Gabriel spins and slashes Michael across the chest. Michael looks down at his ripped shirt. Gabriel punches him in face. Gabriel lunges with the mace, but Michael blocks the blow. The mace flies out of Gabriel's hands. Michael punches and kicks Gabriel. He gets on Gabriel's back, with his arms around his neck. Gabriel flies upwards and batters Michael against the ceiling. Michael keeps his arms held tight around Gabriel's neck. Michael holds on tight. Gabriel reaches down and picks up the mace. Gabriel holds the mace to his side and twists it. A blade shoots out, stabbing Michael behind him. Michael flops back onto the floor, his mouth wide open. Michael lies with his arms outstretched, eyes wide open, twitching slightly, a bloody wound in his chest. Gabriel turns and stares down at Michael. Tears glisten in Gabriel's eyes. Michael's bloody lips twitch. His eyes close as he expires. A golden light spreads over him. A tear runs down Gabriel's cheek as he watches. The bright light engulfs Michael, then vanishes taking him with it. Gabriel turns to go. As Jeep drives through the light, Charlie turns and looks at him. Black lines and symbols spread up his arm. Gabriel slowly steps through the wrecked diner holding his mace. He goes behind the counter where Bob is laying amongst the wreckage. Bob holds his lighter out to a gas tap at the base of an oven. He looks up at Gabriel. He sparks up a flame, igniting the gas. Gabriel takes flight as flames engulf the diner and the possessed outside. Jeep drives along a desert highway. Charlie sits on the passenger seat, cradling her baby and smiling down at him. Jeep frowns at Charlie. Then they both look ahead.",
    "854": "He saunters up to her. She takes another drag on her cigarette. Charlie grins, reaches in her overall pocket, and takes out a pack. She holds it out and he takes one. He points at his map. Jeep sees them. Jeep, holding an old wooden cot, stares at them, then walks away. Charlie puffs on her cigarette. In the diner, Audrey sits alone. Sandra squeezes cream into Howard's cupped hand. He rubs it in. Charlie leads a tall, black, 30'ish Kyle inside. Audrey looks up with interest. He glances at the other three diners, then follows Charlie to the counter, all eyes on him. The scruffy, unshaven Bob tilts his head to one side. In the garage, Jeep is cleaning the cot. Bob strides over and sees the old cot on a bench. Bob stares at his son. They're outside. Jeep glares at his father, who shakes his head. Jeep looks down and away from Bob. He glances at his father, who screws up his eyes. Jeep lowers his eyes. Bob pats him affectionately on the cheek. Jeep watches his father go. As Bob enters the diner, Howard turns to him. Bob holds his thumb and forefinger close together. He sees static on the television screen. Outside, Jeep's attention is drawn to something down the road. He steps forward and glances at the horizon. Anomalous-growing dark cloud fills it. Inside, Bob steps up on a chair to examine the TV set. Jeep looks in the opposite direction. Encroaching black cloud dominates the horizon there. Others look at the screen. Kyle proffers money. Percy switches on a radio. He tries tuning it in. Charlie's eyes venture to the TV. Sandra gets to her feet. All six of them are still as they stare at the TV, four standing, Audrey and Howard sitting. Kyle is on the phone in the back. Kyle removes his hat. Bob had switched off the television. In the garage, Jeep is looking at the apparently pristine top of the Beamer's engine block and it's air intake. He looks at it hopelessly. An old white Ford Sedan turns off the road and heads towards the petrol pumps. It passes them and draws to a halt outside the diner. The driver's door opens. The wheels and stanchions of a Zimmer frame are plunked on the rocky ground. An elderly woman with white hair and a pink cardigan emerges from the car. Walks a little. Then shuts the door. Jeep looks curiously around. The old woman's shadow is cast on the diner door. She opens the door and shuffles in with the aid of the Zimmer. Kyle and Percy glance around. Charlie spots her. Audrey glances up at the old woman who grins and looks over at Howard and Sandra.",
    "856": "The car is coming from the opposite direction from where the swarm of flies came. It screeches off the road towards the diner. Charlie sees it from a window. She runs outside. The others watch as the car stops. Jeep spots Charlie. The door opens. Michael steps out. He sees Charlie, clutching her belly, run towards him. Jeep runs over beside her. Charlie slows down as Michael stares at her. Michael opens his mouth, keeping his teeth clenched. Bob keeps the pump-action aimed at him. He sees the body. Michael tilts his head to one side. Michael snatches the pump-action. Kyle points his pistol. The shotgun is at Bob's forehead. Bob closes his eyes tightly. Percy comes outside. Bob screws up his face. Michael keeps the shotgun in place. Jeep and Charlie watch transfixed. Michael takes his left hand off the barrel, his right holding the shotgun in position. He turns and looks away. Bob opens his eyes. Michael hands him the gun. Michael goes to the boot of the squad car, opens it, and takes out assault rifles. He hands them to Kyle, Bob, and Jeep. Michael rushes past Jeep and Bob and heads straight for Charlie. He hands her a pistol. Charlie turns and watches him stride towards the diner. Audrey and Sandra come out. The wind rises, blowing dust before it. Bob stares at the length of the road before moving. Jeep keeps his eyes on the road, then runs to the diner. Inside, they barricade the doors. Jeeps pushes the office desk against the back door. Kyle looks out through slathered blinds. Behind him, Michael picks up an assault rifle and stands beside Jeep, who glances nervously at him. The lights go out. A torchlight beam illuminates the diner. Bob shines one at Michael. Michael looks up at the ceiling. Bob leads the way up through a skylight. He clambers up the roof to a metal ladder and steps onto a metal walkway in front of the diner's unlit neon sign. Percy, Kyle, and Michael are with him. They see a light in the distance. It is an ice cream van. Kyle and Bob turn to Percy. He steadies the rifle with his claw-like metallic hand. As the van approaches, down in the diner, Audrey peeps out through the blinds. Jeep is also in the diner with a big torch. The van pulls into the forecourt. The Frosty Treats van pulls up. Audrey joins her mom on the floor, beside Howard. Charlie ducks down behind the counter, the pistol Michael gave her in her hand. Jeep is close by. The others on the roof watch as the driver gets out. Two long, bony hands cling on to the door frame as the ice cream man with a blue forage cap emerges.",
    "858": "On the roof, Kyle watches as the intruders slope off. They trudge away from the diner. Michael clutches on to Sandra, who sinks to her knees. Jeep helps Charlie up. She looks apprehensive as Michael approaches. Kyle leads in the others from the roof. Audrey tries to console her mother. Bob grimly strides forward. Michael stares at the others. He turns to Charlie. Her smile fades when she sees his somber face and steadfast gaze. Charlie closes her eyes. He loads an assault rifle, turns, and walks away from them. Outside, intermittent bright flashes illuminate the horizon. Kyle is on the roof with Percy. Kyle glances down at Percy, who is crouched low, leaning against a ledge. Percy looks around at Kyle. Percy turns away and leans a rifle over his arm. Kyle looks awkward. Percy watches as Kyle places the gun on the ledge. Kyle shakes his head. Percy blinks and glances down. Tears fall from his eyes. Kyle raises his head, then turns to stare at Percy beside him. Downstairs, Bob turned on the grill, then lights a cigarette with his lighter. He takes a deep drag, then breathes it out. He picks up a can and drinks from it. He looks across the room at Sandra, whose hair, which had been pulled tight, is now loose. He sets a beer down in front of her. Having wiped the top of the can, she gazes at it, then drinks. She sets it down on the table. Sandra buries her head in her hands. In the storeroom, Jeep looks at Michael curiously. Jeep takes a claw hammer off a hook. Michael hangs his head. He walks over to Jeep. Jeep stares frowning at Michael, who wears a benign expression. Michael leaves a thoughtful-looking Jeep. Bob stands on the roof, leaning against the wall. He drinks beer from a can and puffs on a cigarette. Wind whips through his hair. The sky is filled with dense, gray clouds. He flinches at the sound and looks out at a bank of gray mist. Michael stands on the roof, looking pensive. Michael stands on a roof, silhouetted against bright sunlight. He has wings. He's with an elder angel, Gabriel. An army of angels flies overhead. Michael slowly steps across the roof of the diner. The two children swings are blown back and forth by the wind. The strings of light bulbs shake. He drops his beer can. As gray mist rolls in, Bob is sitting by the wall dozing. Sandra is lying on the floor next to Audrey. She wakes and looks around anxiously. She sits up. Hearing the voice, she looks around. She slowly walks through the diner with her arms held stiffly away from her sides.",
    "859": "She goes behind the counter. Sandra goes into a gloomy corridor. She stops and looks at a door which is slightly ajar. She steps towards the door which has light peeping through the gap. Sandra reaches out, pushes the door wide open, and enters the office. Shafts of bright sunlight stream through the small window above the desk. Sandra's face is bathed in the golden light. Sandra moves a chair to the wall, stands on it, and looks out of a window. Outside, Howard is bound to an inverted cross. Enormous blisters bubble on his skin. The blisters on Howard's exposed arms and chest throb. As Sandra climbs down off the chair, Kyle runs in and grabs her around the waist. Sandra elbows Kyle aside. Audrey wakes up and runs to the office. Sandra is heaving the desk away from the door. She pushes Audrey away. Sandra runs outside. Percy grabs her. Howard's blisters throb and pulsate. Percy grabs Sandra around the waist and turns her away. Howard's stomach explodes in a shower of steaming liquid. Percy heaves Sandra into the office. Sandra flops on the floor. Charlie stares at Percy, leaning in the doorway. Percy stares blankly into space. He falls flat on his face. His back has been burnt off. Steam wafts around his exposed organs. In the storeroom, Percy lies under a white sheet. Bob leans on the covered corpse and wears a wretched expression. Jeep stands in the doorway. Bob's face twitches. In the diner, Sandra sits bound to a chair with her wrists tied behind her back. Bright shafts of light stream through gaps between planks nailed up against the window. Kneeling in front of Sandra, Audrey takes a pill from a pot. Her face wet with tears, Sandra nods. Audrey pops the pill in her mouth and offers her a drink through a straw. Audrey smiles. Sandra narrows her eyes and fixes her with a cold, bitter stare. Kyle walks in. Shaken, Audrey gets up and follows Kyle. Charlie sits looking pensive as Audrey tries to tune the radio, turning the dial and moving the aerial around. Michael shakes his head. Charlie looks down at her belly. Standing in the bathroom, Charlie lights a cigarette and has a puff. By the light of a lantern and a couple of candles, she regards her pretty face in the mirror for a moment. Her expression is fraught. She gently runs her thumb over her pregnant belly, then throws down the cigarette sharply. She stamps on the cigarette, grabs her jacket, and walks out. She sits alone in the kitchen with her feet up. She looks up and smiles at Jeep. She takes her feet off the chair.",
    "86": "They look towards the departed PREACHER. JOHN has taken charge. He speaks very quietly, but calmly and cheerfully, as to an invalid. He starts down the rustling coal-heap, helping PEARL down. They have achieved the cellar floor. PREACHER looks under the bed. o.s., PREACHER'S footsteps come down stairs; JOHN leads PEARL carefully past a rake, a hoe, and a shelf-prop and they crouch down into beside an apple barrel. PREACHER'S footsteps cross kitchen o.s. Both look sharp towards cellar door o.s. The door opens; PREACHER'S head, carrying a candle in holder; a white-washed wall and stairs are lighted. He clop-clops nearly to the bottom of the stairs. ICEY'S voice cuts cheerfully across his descent. ICEY clucks her tongue o.s. She appears at head of stairs. Her voice crackles with authority. A short pause; then the children, covered with coal-dust, emerge into the light and climb the stairs. JOHN'S head is hung in defeat. As they enter the kitchen we PULL BACK. JOHN looks to PEARL and we PAN HER IN as PREACHER'S hand named LOVE moves through her locks. We PAN with PREACHER and ICEY as they move towards the door. He watches ICEY leave, o.s. ICEY goes away along path outside. PREACHER, his back to us, watches her a moment, then turns. Wondering what to do next. We begin with HEAD CLOSE-UP of BIRDIE as he rocks, and PULL BACK He is rocking; and drunk. A bottle stands beside the picture. He turns and speaks to the picture. His hands grip the edge of the chest on either side of the picture, which we now see. BIRDIE picks up the bottle. His hand and the liquor tremble. The bottle falls from his hand onto its side on the edge of the chest. The reverse angle of the opening shot. BIRDIE rocks heavily; liquor gurgles from bottle to floor. PREACHER sits at head of table. JOHN stands to PREACHER'S right, around corner of table; he remains expressionless and immobile, until he speaks. The table is loaded with good food. PREACHER, well-fed and at leisure, dabs his mouth delicately with his napkin, folds it, puts it in a ring, and folds his hands. He waits. PEARL frowns and puts her finger in her mouth; she remembers he twisted her arm. He slaps the table; his eyes crackle. PEARL starts to snivel. He brings out the knife. PEARL shakes her head for no. He touches the spring; the blade flicks open. He lays the open knife on the table. PEARL thinks the knife is a toy and crosses behind JOHN to pick it up. Her mouth quivers; a large tear brims in her eyes. PEARL sniffles and wipes her eyes with her free fist.",
    "869": "Thenardier is down in the sewer. Thenardier takes Marius' gold signet ring and puts it on. Valjean grabs Thenardier. Shoved Thenardier down into the sludge. Valjean gets up and hauls Marius up onto his shoulder. With the unconscious Marius over his shoulder, Valjean wades up through the knee-deep sewerage. Dim light filtering through gratings above, washes over the curved brick work. The sewerage gets deeper. Valjean is up to his neck. He holds Marius up next to him. He shoves a gate open. He drags Marius through an outflow pipe into the dark night. He looks up and sees Javert standing there waiting for him. Covered in sewerage, Valjean holds Marius onto his shoulder and climbs up steps out of the sewer. Javert aims a pistol at him. Valjean turns to Javert, who holds the pistol steady. Valjean considers. Valjean turns and walks away. Wearing a troubled frown, Javert stares at the pistol for a moment, then drops it into the sewer. Javert starts to walk away. Javert stands at the edge of a steep drop into a massive swirling sluice. He Paces at the edge of the sheer drop. Way down below the water surges and churns with white foam and yellow filth. Javert leans forward and drops into the abyss. Javert is washed away into the swirling foam. Marius wakes in a clean bed beneath a ceiling painted with cherubs and angels. Nearby is a child's rocking horse. His grandfather sits beside. Outside the women clean blood from the battle off the troubles. Marius sits alone in a room, scarred by battle. His left arm is in a sling. He stares into space thoughtfully. Tears fall from his eyes. He stands and looks around. Marius' brow is arched and his face wracked with anguish. Cosette sits watching him. She reaches out to him. He limps over to her and takes her hand. Cosette walks with Valjean and the limping Marius into his grandfather's mansion. His grandfather watches. Cosette and Marius kiss. Marius with Valjean. Marius takes a seat in the spartan room. Valjean struggles for words. Valjean hangs his head. Valjean bows, and Marius, his arm no longer in a sling but still walking with a limp, takes his leave. Valjean carries a large trunk out to a waiting carriage. Valjean grimaces in pain. Marius is with Cosette. On the journey he leans back in the carriage. Cosette's wedding day. Thenardier and his wife hitch a ride on the back of a carriage which arrives at the mansion. They sneak round to the far side of the carriage, climb inside, and exit through the opposite door as if they'd arrived in the carriage. Dressed finely, they mingle with the guests, stealing as they go.",
    "872": "He pretends to spoon more of the sauce, and Kate opens her mouth ready to taste it. Nick draws the spoon away a couple of times and watches her full lips open and close. Then, he leans over and plants a kiss to one side of her mouth. The couple move apart slightly and Kate pulls off her blindfold. She moves back in towards Nick. Nick's face edges towards Kate's, and this time he kisses her fully on the lips. The couple begin to kiss more urgently. Kate brings her hands up to cup Nick's face and she stands. Her eyes are closed and her face is relaxed into a serene ecstasy, as Nick kisses her neck then returns to her lips. Finally, Kate falls into Nick's embrace. Next morning, Nick strides down the hallway rattling a spoon in a saucepan. In Zoe's room. Zoe, Kate and Nick are piled into a photo booth. Outside, Kate screams with glee at the pictures. The trio walk down a cold, sunny New York street. Nick has Zoe on his shoulders. All three wear coats, scarves and woolly hats. They dart across a busy street to a Chinese vegetable shop. They leave the shop. All three wear cycling helmets as they pedal a bicycle made for three. The sun sets against the Manhattan skyline as they pedal alongside the river. Nick sits up front. Later in the evening, they come across a street artist copying a fantastical picture of a ballerina onto the pavement in colored chalk. Nick and Kate hold hands. Zoe beams up at them as she admires the drawing. The staff are gathered at the restaurant to review the menu. In the kitchen, Nick completes a vegetable garnish on a dish and lays it out for a waiter. Kate eyes him with suspicion. Paula strolls in from the dining room. Nick is wide-eyed with surprise as he watches Kate stride off to the walk-in fridge. He joins her. The couple stare at each other. From the kitchen, they're framed in the window of the fridge door. Kate is left thoughtful. She returns to her apartment, where a woman in her 60s waits on the sofa. Kate locks the apartment door, turns out the hall lights and saunters back into the room. Passing a side table, she presses a button on the answer phone then lifts a remote and turns off the music. Kate stares thoughtfully. She heads towards her bedroom. Zoe cuddles up to her furry kangaroo. Kate goes into her room. Zoe rolls onto her side. At the restaurant, Paula tackles Kate as she prepares dishes. Kate interviews a series of applicants. At the apartment, Zoe watches TV as Kate works at her desk.",
    "873": "Zoe returns to watching the black-and-white gangster movie on the TV. Zoe's eyes dart around as she thinks. Suddenly, she rises resolutely from the sofa, strides out of the open-plan lounge and down the hallway, past the double doors opening onto Kate's desk. She ignores Kate. Kate remains at her desk. In her room, Zoe sits on her bed with a scarlet-haired smiling rag doll resting on her drawn up knees. She pulls up the doll's striped skirt and red polka dot top. Zoe considers the words with downcast eyes, then replaces the doll's clothing. She stares into the doll's face. Wearing a white dressing gown and with damp hair, Kate strides down the hallway. Kate is outside Zoe's school. They drive around in Nick's blue pickup truck. Kate holds her hand to her mouth. She runs her hand through her hair. Kate moves around to the side of Zoe's bed and catches sight of the cuddly toys on her pillow. She considers them briefly, then picks up the furry kangaroo. They drive past leafless trees into the bleak, deserted cemetery. Zoe returns the hug that Kate has given her. Both crying, Kate kisses Zoe's cheek and gently wipes away her tears. The pair separate. Zoe mouths an acknowledgment, then turns to pick up her red rucksack. They stand. Kate brushes off her long, black coat and takes Zoe's hand as they walk away from the grave towards Nick, who's been watching from a distance. Amid the faded flowers on the grave is Zoe's peacock feather, fluttering in the breeze. Nick drives Zoe and Kate home. As he pulls up, Zoe turns to him. Kate and Zoe climb out of the truck. Kate hands her the keys. Nick offers his hand, which Kate takes. Her eyes fix longingly on him. Nick squeezes her hand. She pulls away. She closes the door and looks at Nick through the window. Kate stands alone in the sunlit street as a truck drives away. The busy restaurant kitchen. Bernadette reenters the kitchen. Brandishing an uncooked steak held high on a carving fork, Kate marches out of the kitchen through the dining room and up to table seven. Kate tears off her apron, thrusts it at a waiter, and strides out. Paula stares blankly as Kate hails a cab and gets in. On her therapist's roof terrace overlooking Manhattan, Kate turns and eyes the man with realization. In a shabby elevator, Kate clutches a copper saucepan wrapped in a tea towel. She steps out onto a landing lined with a discarded metal trolley and window grill. She hesitates, then knocks. Without taking his eyes off Kate, Nick steps back from the door, revealing an open-plan loft apartment beyond.",
    "875": "She unpacks a rabbit. A plate of vegetables and a fish with a gaping mouth is slid in front of Zoe. Zoe sits and stares at her dinner in horror, as Kate squeezes lemon over her fish. Zoe shakes her head. Kate's smile fades and she looks disappointed, as Zoe gets up and leaves the table. Zoe sits in her bedroom, playing with a red-haired rag doll. Zoe looks sadly down at her doll, as Kate goes. Patrons sitting in a window table smile and chat as they enjoy a meal. Kate rounds a corner and enters the restaurant, walking straight past Paula who's standing by the door chatting to two customers. Kate makes her way through the crowded dining area. Hearing singing, Kate slows down as she nears the kitchen. She meets Bernadette coming out with two plates. Kate walks into the kitchen. Leah's standing with a man holding a pastry brush. The man turns. He conducts. Kate watches in disbelief, as the man raises his arms in the air and sings to the staff. He's holding an uncooked quail in his other hand. Kate turns to Paula. Kate whisks the man's coat off him. Paula leads the couple to their table. Kate and Paula go into a small glass-fronted room filled with well-stocked, floor-to-ceiling wine racks. Kate's speechless. She looks over at Nick, who stands grinning at her. Kate points at a pan on the stove next to him. The contents have caught fire. Kate shakes her head at Paula in disbelief, then grabs her bag and heads out. A flicker of a smile plays on Paula's lips. Kate wearily climbs the stairs to her apartment. A packet of chopsticks have been sellotaped to her door. She bends down and picks up a plastic take-away bag. She takes the chopsticks off the door and walks inside. She walks down the hallway to Zoe's bedroom. Kate pokes her head around the open door, then tries to enter her own bedroom. The door won't budge. She forces it open a crack. Kate sees Zoe curled up, asleep on her bed. Kate walks into the bathroom and enters her bedroom through an adjoining door. A chair has been propped up against the bedroom door to prevent anyone from entering. Kate walks over and moves it aside, along with a wicker laundry basket. Kate steps slowly towards the bed and picks up the remote control, which is lying next to Zoe. She turns off the TV. Kate looks down at her sleeping niece, then places the remote on a chest of drawers. She gently covers Zoe with the bedclothes, then notices as photo album, which had been hidden beneath them. Kate moves the photo album around and begins to look through it.",
    "879": "Kate looks quizzically at Leah, who smiles and gestures towards Nick. He turns around. He nods with a smile. Zoe frowns at Nick. Leah, wearing a thick winter coat, slings her bag over her shoulder as she leaves the staff changing room. Kate walks into her office, where Zoe is slumped over the desk fast asleep. Kate places a scarf around her neck, and looks down at her drawing of a sailboat and a dolphin that Zoe's resting on. Kate carries Zoe through the kitchen. As she reaches the door, she turns back to Nick with a warm smile. He looks back at her kindly and watches them go. In Zoe's dark bedroom, Kate lays her sleeping niece down gently onto the bed. She undoes the laces on Zoe's red and white baseball boots and removes them. She places one of Zoe's stuffed toys down beside her. Zoe immediately cuddles up to it. Next morning. Kate reaches out to turn off her square-faced alarm clock, which reads half-past four. She turns onto her back and opens her eyes sleepily. Kate pulls on a dark Berber-style jacket, as she walks through to the lounge to pick up her mobile. She heads towards the front door. Kate peers back up the hallway at Zoe, who's standing in her bedroom doorway clutching her cuddly Kangaroo. At the fish market, a bored-looking Zoe stands nearby. She's still clutching her cuddly toy. She yawns sleepily. Back at home, Kate and Zoe are asleep on the sofa. Kate stares. She checks her watch. Kate hurries off. Later, they run along the pavement to the school. Kate watches Zoe as she climbs the front steps, opens the heavy front door and goes inside. At the restaurant, Kate and Leah are with a mustachioed man. Leah sniffs it. He reaches into a bag. He conducts Leah, as she breathes deeply. Kate walks into her apartment with a smile. Her long, dark hair hanging loose in large, soft waves. She hangs her bag on a hook by the door, drops her keys into the bowl and begins to remove her coat. Her smile suddenly disappears. She grabs her keys and her bag and scurries out again. In a taxi. Kate jumps out of the taxi and hurries towards the school. Zoe's sitting on the steps. Zoe ignores her. Zoe stands up and strides peevishly towards the yellow cab. Kate follows her and gets in beside her. She pulls the door shut. At home, Zoe stomps straight into her bedroom. Kate walks into hers. Kate's bedroom door opens. She slowly steps out into the hallway. She crosses to Zoe's room and hesitates for a moment, before knocking on the door.",
    "881": "She leads Kate by the hand. A picnic is laid out on the lounge floor. Sitting on cushions in front of a roaring fire, under a sheet stretched out like a safari tent, the trio share the pizza. Zoe pretends to be an elephant. The three then play pick-up sticks with bread sticks. By the light of several candles, Zoe acts out a charade. Wax drips down tall candlesticks beside a half-empty cafetiere of coffee. Zoe's fast asleep on a cushion. Nick crawls round to Zoe and lifts her from the floor. His shadow casts on the side of the sheet tent as he carries her out. Kate takes out a small tray with two espresso cups on it. She pauses to look down the hallway and watch Nick, as he gently carries Zoe to her bedroom. She turns back and stares ahead thoughtfully. Later, the pair are tidying up. Nick opens the fridge and takes out the Tupperware box Kate found in his bag. They sit on the lounge floor with a tiramisu between them. Kate's face brightens as she tastes a spoonful. The candles and firelight illuminate the room. Nick moves across to sit beside Kate. Nick reaches out and wipes a spot of cream from the right side of Kate's mouth. He licks the cream from his finger, and gazes intently at her. Kate's face is turned towards Nick. She looks away briefly and nods. He reaches behind Kate and moves nearer. Lips almost touching, she leans back against his arm. Kate shifts awkwardly as Nick puts on his scarf. He stands, picks up his jacket from the back of the sofa and puts it on as he enters the darkened kitchen to retrieve his pants. Kate smiles serenely to herself. At the therapist. He spins around in his leather chair. Kate furrows her brow. Kate joins the headmistress in her spacious office. Kate leaves. In the park, Zoe is walking on the benches. Zoe runs off. Kate chases after her. Zoe narrowly avoids being hit by a Yellow Cab as she runs across a busy road. Kate dodges the traffic to follow her. Kate steps back and watches helplessly as Zoe runs off. Later, Zoe is on her bed looking at the photo album. As Zoe flicks through the album, she finds a peacock feather like the one she was playing with shortly before the car crash. She sighs and her eyes well with tears. Kate goes down to Sean's apartment. In the dark and deserted kitchen, Kate and Nick share a plate of food and drink red wine across the serving counter. They talk happily together. In the pouring rain, Nick dashes out of his truck outside Kate's apartment building.",
    "884": "Lizzie makes her way over to Charlotte. He shows her into a room. Charlotte and Lizzie are left alone again. She takes Lizzie into the drawing room and walks over to the window. Later, Lizzie is sitting reading in her room. Maria rushes to look out to the window at a carriage that's arrived. Later, the party is making its way up a wide path leading to a majestic mansion with elegantly manicured gardens. Lady Catherine is holding court in her drawing room. Sitting on an ornate, throne-like chair, she looks at Lizzie, who's squashed between Maria and Sir William on a sofa. Lady Catherine raises one eyebrow and turns her attention to Charlotte. As she turns to Lizzie, her smile fades and she glares fiercely. Maria, Charlotte, and Lizzie are walking outside in the gardens. In the house. Darcy rises from his seat and comes to stand over Lizzie. Darcy makes no effort to make any further inquiries. He strides slowly and pointedly over to the window, where he stands with his back to the room. Lizzie looks at Fitzwilliam. Darcy turns to look at her. He smiles at her, and Darcy turns back to the window, poker-faced. It's a bright, sunny day. The wooded green fields of the English countryside stretch out to the horizon. Lizzie wanders alone, taking in the sumptuous view. She idly pats the trunk of a large tree as she passes by. Then, continues on under the shady canopy of leaves. She takes her time staring up into the branches that shield her from the glare of the sun. Darcy is riding his horse through the woods, a picture of elegance in his top hat and frock coat. Spying Lizzie, he brings his horse to a halt, never once taking his eyes off her. Lizzie stops. Nonchalantly crossing her arms in front of her, she stares up defiantly at Darcy. Looking awkward, Darcy kicks his horse on. They set off down the avenue of trees at a trot. Lizzie watches them not quite knowing what to make of the encounter. Later, Fitzwilliam sits with Lizzie as she plays the piano. In an adjoining room, Lady Catherine is listening. Darcy, Charlotte, and Maria are sitting in a sofa near her. Darcy goes in to join Lizzie and Fitzwilliam. They share an intense gaze. At the sound of the front doorbell, Lizzie sets down her pen, gets up from the writing table, and checks that her hair's straight. The maid shows Darcy in. He bows stiffly. The maid curtsies and leaves the room. Lizzie takes a seat. A rather awkward silence ensues between them with neither quite able to look the other in the eye. Eventually, Darcy pulls out a chair and sits down.",
    "886": "Watching her pass by, his eyes linger on her for a long moment as she talks to Charlotte. However, when he realizes they're discussing him, he turns away. Resplendent in her green silk gown and fashionable feather hat, Miss Bingley is tolerating the dancing, wheeling in and out with a haughty air. Lizzie is up with Bingley and having a much better time of it. Whilst Miss Bingley and Mrs. Hurst watch the moment with disgust, slumped in a chair, a sozzled Mr. Hurst taps his glass, demanding a refill. Mrs. Bennet watches with glee as Jane and Bingley happily dance together. Darcy's not so pleased. They hurry to greet her. At the party, Mary is playing the piano. Several men, in the red and gold brocade uniforms of their regiment, mill amongst the party-goers. Lydia and Kitty are surrounded by officers. Darcy stands, watching proceedings with his customary aloof air. On the opposite side of the room, Lizzie catches his brooding stare and is, for the briefest moment, affected by it, before she quickly composes herself and turns to Colonel Forster. The Bingley sisters share a look. Lydia grabs a young boy and girl by the hand and leads them on to the floor. Several officers join them. Lizzie turns and looks at the intimate pair. Mr. Darcy becomes aware of them looking at him and glowers. Lydia is dancing playfully. Lizzie makes her way across the room. Darcy watches Lizzie go. Miss Bingley sidles up to him. She looks decidedly put out. As she backs away from him, his gaze remains on Lizzie. Now, the Bennets' dining room. Mr. Bennet raises his eyebrows. Now, Jane is riding Nellie through a rainstorm. She's soaked through. At home, Lizzie looks with concern at the storm outside. She gives her mother a reproachful look. Jane continues, making slow progress. Now, she's seated in an ornate dining room, eating dinner with Bingley's sisters. Miss Bingley gives her a patronizing smile. Jane closes her eyes, looking faint. Now, the Bennets are eating breakfast. Lizzie, Lydia and Kitty are walking arm-in-arm through Meryton. Lydia looks around distractedly. They scurry away together. Lizzie is walking through a field, holding her bonnet in her hand. She climbs over a stile, the hem of her pale dress already caked in mud. She lands in a quagmire. Her boots are filthy. She gives a good-natured shrug and carries on her way. She trots over the field towards Netherfield Hall, standing proudly in the distance. As she gets closer, she walks under the shadow of a tree, then startled when Darcy emerges around a corner. He is equally startled. She curtsies. She becomes a little embarrassed. He disguises a look of amusement, then steps aside for her to pass and follows her, as she strides towards the Hall.",
    "888": "Caroline Bingley paces the room, holding an open book in her hands. Mr. Bingley prods the fire with his foot. Miss Bingley walks over to Darcy, who's engrossed in a book. She flirtatiously leans on his chair in order to read over his shoulder. He ignores her and turns the page. With malevolent intent in her eyes, she crosses to Lizzie. Lizzie looks around her awkwardly, then shuts her book, stands, and sets off, arms linked, around the room with Miss Bingley. He considers this for a moment. Miss Bingley attempts to break the palpable tension by crossing to the piano. Darcy and Lizzie steadily hold each other's gazes. Jane and Lizzie are in a two-horse carriage. He beams at her. Bingley steps away from the door, still grinning. He raises a hand to bid them farewell. As the carriage leaves, Darcy watches its progress from a window. He remains staring out of the window. Now inside the carriage. Jane smiles dreamily. A lady's hand at work on a delicate piece of floral embroidery. Lizzie is walking through the countryside. Green leaves are starting to turn brown. She watches the progress of geese flying through the sky overhead. At the Bennet's dining table. He gives them a look. An austere-looking woman. The obsequious Mr. Collins pulls up. He clumsily climbs down from the carriage, causing Jane to stifle a giggle. He bows to them reverentially. Now, a lavish dinner. Lizzie gives her father a look. Lizzie giggles. Mr. Collins gives Jane an ingratiating smile. Now the family is outside amusing themselves in the gardens. Mr. Collins is walking with Mrs. Bennet. He looks at the girls carefully. Lydia and Kitty are playing a game with hoops, Mary studying a book, and finally Lizzie, laughing and smiling with Jane. He bustles over to her. She looks uncertain. Now the sisters are walking over a stone bridge, accompanied by Mr. Collins. He's exhausted from the walk. They make their way into the village, carriages rolling past and people talking on corners. Lydia and Kitty rush ahead and stop at a shop window. Denny crosses to meet them with his companion. Bingley and Darcy ride by. He dismounts from his gray horse, and joins them. Mr. Wickham and Mr. Darcy spot each other. A look passes between them before Mr. Wickham lifts his hat to him. Lizzie watches the exchange with interest. Lizzie studies Darcy as he rides away sitting stiff and proper in the saddle. Lizzie and Kitty race in followed by Mary. He backs away from them, and takes a seat at a card table. Lizzie looks grateful for his departure. Mary starts playing the piano. At the whist table, Mr. Collins lays down a card, much to Mrs. Phillips's disgust.",
    "889": "He falters for a moment, then his smile returns. Lydia and Kitty are enjoying a card game with the officers. Mr. Wickham, now resplendent in his red uniform, watches them with amusement before sitting down next to Lizzie. He leans forward in his seat. They smile at Lydia's celebrations. Lizzie looks thoughtful. Her eyes meet Mr. Wickham's and they smile at each other warmly. She watches him dance with Lydia and smiles to herself. A bedroom. She lowers her eyes coyly. Jane looks unsure. He giggles. A look between Lizzie and Jane. Lydia and Kitty are being pushed on a swing by two uniformed officers. Mr. Collins reluctantly follows Jane leaving Wickham and Lizzie alone. They stroll through the garden together. She turns to him. They watch as Kitty jumps from the swing into the arms of an officer. Then, they set off walking again. Lizzie smiles contentedly to herself. Now, Mrs. Bennet rushes into Lizzie's room, where a maid is seeing to her hair. Lizzie pops out her cheeks. She runs out of the room. Mr. Collins is leaving his room. He's shocked to bump into the half-dressed Lydia. He tries to pass her but the landing is too small. He covers his eyes and walks hurriedly past the giggling Lydia. Knowing the laughter is at him, he regains his composure before heading down the stairs. Night time at Netherfield Hall. A constant stream of carriages drop guests at the doors. Mr. Collins helps Lizzie and Jane down from their carriage. As they make their way up a flight of steps, Lizzie spots Darcy looking out of a window. He catches her eye, then turns away. The family makes its way inside, where their cloaks are taken by footmen in wigs. Jane and Lizzie look around the room excitedly before being received by the Bingleys. Lizzie steps away from her family and looks around the room searchingly. Mr. Bingley standing with Jane calls over to her. He offers her his arm, then leads them both through to the next room. Musicians are playing at one end of a large wooden-floored room. Mr. Bingley escorts the sisters proudly through the gathered guests, nodding greetings to uniformed officers and finely attired ladies. Lizzie looks around the other guests while Jane and Bingley chatter happily together. A hopeful smile plays across her lips when she spots a group of red-coated officers gathered in a corner. Darcy is standing a little behind the group. He turns his head, and he and Lizzie catch each other's eye for a moment before she hastily looks away. He continues looking at her. A beautiful smile crosses her face, when Denny breaks away from the others and joins her.",
    "890": "They both look over at Darcy, who glowers before striding away. Lydia and Kitty drag Denny and the other officer away. Lizzie looks puzzled and a little disappointed. Her bad humor disappears when she spies Charlotte across the room. She hurries over to her happily. He holds out a hand to Lizzie, who reluctantly takes it, and they cross the floor to join the dance. Mr. Collins, all in black, prances over to the lady next to Lizzie. They curtsey and bow, circle each other. Then, he returns to the line of men. As Lizzie dances, Mr. Collins leers at her. Then, normally, makes to follow her in the dance. Darcy is watching with amusement. Lizzie sees him looking and glares. Darcy's face drops and then returns to his usual stern composure. He slowly walks around the dancers passing Mrs. Bennet deep in conversation. He watches Jane and Bingley performing the intricate moves of the dance. As they cross each other, briefly holding each other's outstretched hands, Darcy seems to take more of an interest in them. He looks contemptuously at Lydia dancing with gay abandon with the officers. Darcy turns back on himself stopping by flickering candles. His eyes once more drawn back to Lizzie, skipping in a circle with her dance set, her dark hair swinging like a ponytail. Darcy's gaze is steady. His high white shirt collar and dark coat frame his stern features. Another dance is taking place. Charlotte and Lizzie are talking. Darcy is standing before them. He bows. They curtsy in return. He bows once more and leaves. Lizzie resignedly leaves Charlotte's sight. With the men on one side of the floor and women on the other, Lizzie and Darcy stand opposite to each other looking serious. The men slowly bow and the dance begins. The gentlemen and the ladies grasp each other's hands, and circle one way, then the other. Lizzie and Darcy maintain steady eye-contact throughout. As they move away from each other, then double back to cross over. A slight smile is playing across Lizzie's lips. Darcy's face betrays no emotion. They form a straight line with another couple before releasing hands, turning and coming to a brief halt facing each other. The dance forces them away from each other. She sighs heavily raising her eyebrows. They circle each other holding hands. Darcy is still serious. The passing of the dance leads Lizzie away for a moment, then back again. They separate to allow a couple to move between them. Then they return to being opposite to one another. Lizzie hides a look of amusement as the dance continues. The nine couples move in unison watched by other guests, a magnificent chandelier hanging over their heads.",
    "894": "The older newcomer takes a seat. Purvis approaches. Horses barrel down a racetrack, jockeys crouched on their backs. An announcer watches from a tower. Onlookers crowd the rails. Among them, Billie grins, Dillinger beside her. In cheers, the horses race shoulder to shoulder. Later, outside the racetrack, Nitti and D'Andrea sit by a patio table by a grassy crowd. Nitti summons a breath, squinting in the sunlight. D'Andrea waves at Dillinger across the crowd. D'Andrea glances around. Later, Dillinger plumps into a chair in the grandstand. Billie sits beside him. One row down, Pete leans closer. Homer listens too. Homer speaks up. Dillinger faces his girlfriend, who glares at him, then drops her gaze. D'Andrea joins him. D'Andrea leaves. Billie stares off. Dillinger frowns, shifts in his seat, and squarely faces Billie. She hangs her head. Billie allows a thoughtful smile. Leaning forward, she cups the back of Dillinger's head in her hand, and presses her lips to his. He pulls away, gazing into her eyes, and kisses her again. Spectators stand and cheer on the race. Now in a town, a brambly bush grows by a biro cactus and a healthy saguaro. Billie and Dillinger enter the lobby and stroll toward the front desk. A balding clerk faces them. The clerk hands Dillinger a pen. The gang leader signs a guest register. Dillinger picks up a suitcase and heads off with Billie. Now in a hotel room, he opens the suitcase, takes out his Tommy gun and cocks it. Later, he opens a window and pulls the sheer curtains closed. The gang leader takes off his suit coat and handgun, and ambles to a set of closed double doors. Pushing one open, he peeks into a bathroom. Billie sits nude in the tub. As he opens the door all the way, she seductively slides her hands up the porcelain out of the water, then lifts one shapely leg and caresses the tub's rim with her foot. She runs her toes along a soap dish. As Johnny turns back to the bedroom, the door bursts open. The balding man from the front desk leads other men in and clouds Dillinger with the butt of a rifle. As another lawman handcuffs him, Billie runs out wearing a towel. Later, the lawmen lead Dillinger into a jail as more officers escort Pete and the heavyset bank robber. Pete struggles as his captors lead him away from his boss. A lawman shuts a door, showing an isolated cellblock. Inside, the officers lock Dillinger inside a holding cell and remove his handcuffs through the bars. Wearing cowboy hats, the officers head out. Dillinger massages his wrists, gazing off. He paces forward and leans tensely on a rail attaching the cell bars one to the next.",
    "896": "Five cars follow the motorcyclists along a dim street. In Dillinger's car, the criminal stares off glumly, then smiles out the window. Dozens of civilians line the street, cheering. The gang leader raises his shackled hands and waves. A young man rushes toward the window. Dillinger's eyes gleam as other fans wave excitedly. He gives a coy, half smile. Later, the convoy drives onto a bridge, passing a set of raised barricades. Now, in a courthouse, a deputy shoves his way through a crowd of journalists, toward a counter. Behind the counter, a plainly dressed woman paces in an office. She strides out to the crowd. As arriving lawmen lead Dillinger inside, cameras flash. The robber skeptically furrows his brow. An officer unlocks Dillinger's wrist restraints. A chubby lawyer puts an arm around Dillinger who rests an elbow on the man's shoulder. The female sheriff glowers. Dillinger shrugs his brows. Dillinger swaggers off, escorted by deputies. Later, a guard unlocks a cellblock door and a deputy guides a portly lawyer inside. The lawyer nonchalantly follows a second guard farther ahead. Now, a hulking black inmate strides past a row of cells and enters a common room where Dillinger reads a newspaper. The hulking man leans to Dillinger's ear. Dillinger scowls toward his cell then heads over. The hulking inmate positions himself just outside. He waves two prisoners on. Now, Dillinger faces the bars in the back of his cell. The lawyer, Piquett, sits in a corridor on the other side. Piquett sits back and heaves a misty sigh in the cold air. In a courtroom, Piquett sits at a counsel bench. A deputy escorts Dillinger in, in shackles. Piquett faces the deputy. The judge folds his hands thoughtfully. Bob turns away with a humorless look. As the crowd rises, Dillinger winks at Piquett. The lawyer steps away. As the deputy approaches, Dillinger lowers his gaze. Later, outside the jail, a cluster of National Guardsmen stand watch by a waste high wall of sandbags. Inside, the prisoners mill about the common room. As a few deputies and guards work in a front office, a janitor enters. Later, he hangs up his coat. A guard unlocks a barred door then raises his baton to a second metal door just inside. The guard looks through a peephole then unlocks the door for the janitor. Carrying a mop and bucket, he crosses a hallway and waits for another guard to open another barred door. In the common room, Dillinger tilts his head and clenches his jaw. The janitor enters and the guard shuts the door behind him. Dillinger coolly glances over his shoulder. The janitor sets down his supplies and heads over. Dillinger grabs Cahoon by the back of his jacket and points an odd, waxy gun at his head.",
    "897": "He pushes Cahoon toward the door and the hulking inmate follows close behind. Dillinger hides against a wall. Cahoon peaks through the bars. As the guard opens the door, Dillinger pushes Cahoon away and slams Brian into the wall. The hulking inmate covers Cahoon's mouth. Dillinger spins Brian to the next door, pointing the waxy weapon at his back. Brian refuses. Dillinger pokes Brian with the gun. He shoves Brian to his hulking accomplice, who still restrains Cahoon. Dillinger eyes the door. He kicks it open and hits the guard in the face. Max tumbles down a flight of stairs with Dillinger close behind. His accomplice holds a pipe in his raised hand as he pushes Brian behind Dillinger. Using Max's keys, Dillinger opens the next barred door then forces Max to stand in front of a metal door. The guard on the other side peeks through then unlocks it. As he opens the door, Dillinger shoves him into Max and his accomplice hits Brian with his pipe. Dillinger rushes into the office and holds his gun to the warden's neck. He pushes the warden into the hall while his accomplice restrains a deputy. As Dillinger jams the barrel of his gun into the warden's neck, the warden spins the dial on a safe door. Dillinger steps into the closet sized safe, discards his fake, waxy gun and grabs a pistol from the wall. He steps out with a rifle and hands a machine gun to his accomplice. The warden glances back as the accomplice leads him away. Dillinger grabs a hat and coat from a nearby rack. He puts them on and tosses a jacket to the other inmate who grabs a hat from the rack as he ushers the deputy out behind Dillinger. With his rifle raised, Dillinger cautiously opens a metal door in the hallway. His accomplice follows close behind with one hand clutching the deputy between them. They make their way into a garage where a mechanic works on a police car. Dillinger reaches into one of the cars and rips out its ignition wires. He strides to the Ford V8. Outside, four officers talk to each other on a porch, their guns perched casually against their shoulders. The sleek Ford passes undetected in the alley beside them. At the front of the jailhouse, the National Guardsmen mill about by their sandbag wall. As Dillinger drives through the town, he nervously shifts his eyes back under the tipped down brim of his fedora. The jailhouse mechanic sits beside him while his accomplice rides in back with the deputy. Dillinger notices three National Guardsmen strolling down the sidewalk. He stops for a red traffic light on a corner where more National Guardsmen stand together talking, their guns strapped over their shoulders.",
    "9": "An arrangement of fresh-cut roses in a vase on the opposite counter is deep crimson against the white tile wall. Instantly, the tile is sprayed with blood, the same deep crimson as the roses. Ricky comes down the stairs, followed by Jane. Ricky opens the door from the dining room, then stops. Jane appears behind him. A pool of blood is forming on the kitchen table. Ricky comes into the kitchen and slowly approaches Lester's lifeless body, wide-eyed but not afraid. Ricky kneels, gazing at Lester's unseen face. Lester looks back at us; his eyes are lifeless, but he's smiling the same slight smile. Then he smiles, ever so slightly. We're flying across a white blanket of clouds. Eleven-year-old Lester looks up, pointing excitedly at a dot of light falls across an unbelievably starry sky. Ricky and Jane lie curled up on Jane's bed, fully clothed. They look at each other, alarmed. Maple trees in autumn. Ghostly leaves flutter slowly toward pavement. Angela stands in front of the mirror, fixing her make-up. Angela turns, frightened. Close on an ancient woman's papery hands as they button a cardigan sweater. Carolyn walks slowly toward the red door, drenched to the bone, clutching her purse tightly. A 1970 Pontiac Firebird in the driveway of a suburban home. The sun's reflection in the windshield. The Colonel enters, wet. He's wearing latex gloves. Blood covers the front of his T-shirt. He paces in front of one of his gun cases; the glass door is open, and a gun is conspicuously missing from inside. Jane opens her bedroom door, staring at us. A door opens to reveal 4-year-old Jane, dressed for Halloween in a Princess costume, holding a lit sparkler aloft and smiling shyly at us. Carolyn enters, terrified, still clutching her purse. She shuts the door and locks it, then takes the Glock 19 out of her purse. She opens the closet door and shoves the gun into a hamper. Then, suddenly aware of Lester's scent, she grabs as many of his clothes as she can and pulls them to her, burying her face in them. She sinks to her knees, pulling several items of clothing down with her, and she begins to cry. In black & white: A younger Carolyn sits across from us in one of those spinning-teacup rides, laughing uncontrollably as she twists the wheel in front of her, making us spin even faster. We're watching the video Ricky showed Jane earlier, of the empty white plastic bag being blown about. The wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground.",
    "900": "As Red and Homer return fire, Baby Face shoots at a townsman who holds a pistol at his side. Dillinger crawls to the dead gangster. He looks sadly at Tommy then turns his attention back to the fight. As Baby Face raises his gun to fire again, a guy jumps on his back. Baby Face tosses him into a window. Dillinger joins the others, firing at the second story window across the street. Dust billows around it as bullets hit the exterior stone wall. Red glances over his shoulder. Dillinger reloads his gun and fires it at a man hiding behind a car. He hurries to Baby Face. He drags Baby Face, who continues to shoot. With its door still open, the car pulls out of the town square, leaving the hostages lying helplessly in the street. The car speeds down an empty road lines with tall evergreens that jut into the pale blue sky. Golden sunlight shines on its sleek exterior, reflecting the snow covered ground bordering the woods. Dillinger sits in the backseat, the wind from the open windows blowing against his disheveled hair. In the front passenger seat, Homer stares distantly. Behind him, Dillinger drinks from a flask as Red administers an injection into his shoulder wound. Night time. The cars headlights glow eerily through the trees as it makes its way through the dark woods. The night casts a turquoise hue over Dillinger who clutches his shoulder in the backseat. The car slows as it approaches a lodge where light shines warmly through the windows. As Baby Face pulls the car to a halt, Dillinger addresses him with a frown. The four gangsters enter the lodge. Upstairs, Baby Face bundles cash. As Red preps a dressing, Homer looks on. Red unrolls a bandage and dresses Dillinger's wound. Homer grabs his take. Baby Face picks up two cash bundles and tosses one to Shouse. As they both clear out of the room, Homer hangs by in the doorway. He looks to Dillinger. The leader gives a nod and Homer leaves. Red remains seated at Dillinger's side. As Red wipes his hands, Dillinger springs restlessly to his feet. The two men share a solemn look. He holds out Red's share. Red accepts the cash, gives his brow a resigned lift and shoots a tentative smile at Dillinger. He stows the cash in his bag and leaves. Now in a medical exam room, the gangster with the eye wound pleads with two G-men. Purvis halts a doctor. Purvis courteously gestures for the doctor to step away. The interrogator pushes on the man's wound. Purvis stands with his back to the torture session. The gangster spits at his tormentor. The stern faced G-man turns gravely towards Purvis and nods.",
    "901": "Purvis's beady eyes peer downward, deep in thought. Later, Purvis uses a candlestick phone. On the other end, a boyish agent, Sam Cowley, nods, hangs up, and grabs some maps. As Sam's team arms up, Purvis and his armed peers board a prop plane on an airfield. Now, under a dim table lamp, a hand turns on a boxy radio. He lies down on a modest twin bed. Dillinger picks up his pocket watch off the nightstand, opens it and admires a photo of Billie on the inside of the cover. Dillinger's profile grows blurry as the view focuses on the radio beyond. Now, on a forest road, two motorcars douse their headlights as they creep forward and park on the dirt shoulder. Purvis, Winstead, and several others in trench coats climb out of the vehicles. Purvis closes his door most of the way but leaves it cracked open. The men advance. Armed with their rifles and sub machineguns, the G-men cross the shadowy woods. Purvis and Winstead stand shoulder to shoulder as they spot the lodge a few hundred yards off. Purvis looks Winstead in the eye. The partner G-men filter outwards through the trees toward the lodge. Inside a warmly lit barroom. Outside, Purvis passes in and out of light as he treads forward. Toting a rifle, Baum comes up on his left. Meanwhile, Winstead rounds past a tree. Inside, Baby Face approaches a couple eating dinner. He pats a guy on a barstool then faces the couple. Outside, Purvis spies a window framing a view of two women, a tuxedoed man and a fourth person drinking and smoking inside. As he stalks closer, the tree working class men exit the lodge. Purvis watches them closely from behind a tree. Inside Dillinger's room, a framed religious icon hangs on the wall over his bed as he rests. Outside, the car backs up. Purvis aims his Tommy gun. The car starts forward. Purvis and two of his peers open fire. The shots knock out the headlights and riddle the car from top to bottom with holes. Inside, Dillinger springs awake. Grabs his Tommy gun and goes to a window. In the barroom Baby Face returns fire through a window, as does Dillinger from the second story. As mussel flashes light up the night, indoors and out, Winstead carefully lines up a rifle shot from the base of a tree. Now in Dillinger's room, Wedge joins the shootout. As Purvis sprints for a tree closer to the disabled car, Baby Face unleashes a barrage of fire from a barroom window. Purvis takes cover and reloads. As he makes a run for the car, shells fires from the launch. Outside, Purvis sees the car's lifeless occupants.",
    "904": "Dillinger unlocks the steel door. He pops off his cuffs, pulls out a Tommy gun and bashes the guard. The officer points his own shotgun through the barred door. A guard quickly opens it, and they barge in just as the escapees force their captives into the room. As the guards strip, Dillinger shakes hands with the older inmate. The stocky escapee faces a guard. One guard faces the stocky inmate. He smashes the defiant law man with his pipe. A guard reaches for the younger inmate's gun. The younger inmate shoots him, which captures the rest of the room's attention. Inside Dillinger waits with his Tommy gun as the gang continues to dress. As Dillinger opens the door, the impersonating officer steps outside. Dillinger shuts the door behind him. Inside the criminals run out, leaving their hostages behind. Outside, Red leaves the metal gate behind and crosses the open ground towards the sedan. He glances back to the lookout turret. Outside, Red walks backward 20 yards from the gate. On the lookout turret, guards take aim. Dillinger crosses through the metal gate, followed by his now partially dressed gang. As the escapees race past him, Dillinger faces the entrance and fires his Tommy gun up at the watch tower. One escapee gets shot despite a barrage of gun fire from Dillinger and his armed cohorts. Walter hurries from the gate, still limping. His sandy haired accomplice helps him along and fires back at the tower. Inside the turret, a guard goes down. As Walter reaches the getaway car, another guard fires a rifle. Shot in the back, Walter collapses. Standing on the running board, Dillinger grabs his arm as they drive away. His body dragging across the dirt, Walter hangs onto Dillinger's arm, grimacing in pain. Dillinger struggles to keep his grip while holding onto the moving car himself. Walter looks up to his old friend and grins. Then his hardened face goes blank. His grip on Dillinger's forearm gives way, and the gang leader lets him go. Walter's body slides to a stop in the dirt as the car drives off, leaving a cloud of dust behind. Dillinger lingers for a moment and climbs into the back of the moving sedan. As the sandy haired escapee shuts the door, Dillinger puts a handgun to Shouse's neck. Red drives, sitting next to the younger escapee. Dillinger lowers his handgun and punches Shouse in the face a couple of times. He opens the car door and throws him out of the moving vehicle. Shouse lands on the side of the road, face down in the grass. Dillinger closes the sedan's door and sits back in his seat next to the sandy haired Pete.",
    "905": "Purvis empties his pistol into the man. Baby Face drops onto his back. A plume of exhaled steam jets from his nose, once. Purvis glares over his aimed pistol. Outside a small-town pharmacy, Dillinger returns to the heisted car. Red leans, sweating and bloody, in the corner of the back seat. Dillinger pours antiseptic over Red's wounded abdomen. Dillinger fusses with other supplies. He applies gauze to the wound. Red trains his puffy, exhausted eyes on Dillinger. A feeble smile on Red's lips fades. Dillinger slumps a little, then sits back. His blood-stained hand lets go of Red's shoulder. Eyes downcast, Dillinger stays seated by his deceased partner. He swallows, glancing at Red. His lips give a brief, irritated sneer. He gazes downward. In a field office, Purvis faces his agents. Night time. On a city street, a scowling Dillinger drives past a parked car, which reflects electrical flashes from a passing train. Two agents sit in the parked vehicle. One, a burly man with a Roman nose, peers at an apartment building across the street. His partner sleeps. In the apartment, a seated Billie checks her watch, then turns up a radio. Windows behind her show the passing train. Billie crosses the roomy, run-down apartment, then doubles back to a door. A woman with similar short hair comes down a staircase, hands Billie a large, brown paper bag, and follows her into the apartment. As Billie dons her fur-collared coat, the newcomer takes Billie's seat by the radio. The woman wears a top similar to Billie's. As she skims a newspaper and turns up the radio, another elevated train passes in the windows. In the car, both G-men watch the apartment. In another car, two more agents see someone in an overcoat and fedora toting a paper bag across a dark alley. The stranger ducks down a narrow passage and reaches out with a delicate hand to a brick wall. It's Billie in disguise. She comes to a street on the other end. Carrying the brown paper bag, she steps off the sidewalk between parked cars and looks around in the middle of the street. A car's headlights illuminate and shine on her anxious face. Situated about a block away, the car approaches and comes to a stop. Billie hops in next to Dillinger, who chews gum and smiles. Billie takes off the hat, kisses his cheek, and holds him. Dillinger drives off. Billie rests her head on his shoulder. In the field office, Purvis and his agents listen to Madala. The agents abruptly gaze out the door. Purvis steps forward, arms folded across his chest. In the outer office, the solemn, burly agent stands with his partner. As Purvis gazes at them, his eyes water.",
    "906": "He works his lips. Nitti listens to the radio. Nitti phones D'Andrea. Cardboard tags label switchboard cables at the telephone exchange. As an agent stands by, two female operators work an adjacent switchboard. Outside, on a moonlit shoreline, Dillinger sits by a sleeping Billie. Her hair hangs in her face. Dillinger gazes at her and brushes her dark hair aside to reveal her big eyes. She briefly lowers her gaze. She smiles. He takes her in his arm. Beyond them, the horizon sprawls perfectly flat between the sand and black sky. Dillinger's car parks on a street. Billie smiles at him and gets out of the car. Peering through his round sunglasses, Dillinger watches her go. He looks into his side view mirror and sees only a man at a mailbox, a vagrant, and a few pedestrians. In her fur-collared coat, Billie crosses the street between passing vehicles. She enters the building. In the car, Dillinger faces the side mirror and brushes his bangs off his forehead. Inside, Billie passes through another doorway. Purvis' men grab her. They handcuff her. She uncomfortably glances at the agents. Outside, Dillinger waits in the car. More armed agents exit a building directly in front of him. He startles slightly. But the G-men step right past, realizing he's inside, and cross the street. Dillinger takes off his sunglasses. The agents restraining Billie indoors lead her outside. Dillinger glares into his side mirror, then gets out of the car. The two lovers make eye contact as the burly agent marches Billie away, shoving her toward a government car. Dillinger steps forwards with a pistol in hand. The burly agent pushes Billie into the back seat and gets in next to her. As they drive away, Billie peers through the back window, sitting between two agents. A shocked Dillinger stands out in the open, watching the car drive off. Several armed agents remain behind on the sidewalk. They fail to notice Dillinger, who strides around a parked car and returns to his vehicle. Dillinger gets in and shuts the door. Gripping the steering wheel, he bows his head and collects his breath. His car backs out. Dillinger leaves the remaining agents behind. The gangster wipes his reddened face and holds a hand over his mouth as he sobs. In a dim interrogation room, the burly agent leans in front of Billie, who sits in a chair. His partner stands behind her. She slouches, her left cheek bruised. The interrogator smacks her and grabs her chin. He flings her head to the side and stands upright. The interrogator steps out of the room. Billie trembles. Her right hand cuffed to the chair, she holds her knees together.",
    "907": "In the outer office, the burly agent downs a paper cup of water and passes Doris, who glares at him as he returns to the interrogation room. The interrogator returns, shuts the door, and eyes Billie. He crosses to her and grabs her chin again. He grabs her chin. He shakes her. Billie's mouth hangs open. She shudders. Her lips tremble as she finds words. The two agents leave her. On the way through the field office, the interrogator points to Doris. She holds the telephone at her shoulder. He puts on his jacket. The other men gather their things and move out. Doris dials her telephone. The agents run up a stairwell. Standing outside an apartment door, one shoots the top and bottom hinges. They rush in. Daylight filters into a bare room through an open window. The place is empty. The burly agent stiffens his jaw. Back in the interrogation room, Billie sits with her head down. The two agents barge in. The burly one grabs a phone book and whacks her with it. She keeps her head down, then looks directly at him. As Purvis enters the field office, Doris approaches him. In the interrogation room. She lowers her head and wipes her mouth. The interrogator glares down at her and tensely wipes his mouth. Billie looks him in the eye. He sneers and winds up with his fist. Winstead intercepts his arm and slams him against the wall. Purvis enters. The other interrogator quickly uncuffs Billie's right arm from the chair. As she holds her wrist, Purvis leans over to her. He stands upright. Billie presses down on the arms of the chair to get up, then stops. Purvis glances at the other interrogator, then lifts Billie from the chair and carries her out. In the hall, the rest of the agents stand aside as he passes with the weakened woman. Interrogation room, Winstead lowers his arm from the burly agent's throat and leaves. Purvis nods to Doris. She escorts them. In the interrogation room, the burly agent stays put beside the open door, out of the sightline of his peers, who stare in from the hall. On a pool hall, Marty dials a pay phone. At his home, Nitti answers. A woman sits at a bar. A door opens across the room. Marty enters and takes a seat next to her. Her weary gaze hangs straight ahead. Then she looks directly at Marty. He takes her hand and gazes into her eyes. They pick up their drinks and share another glance. They both sip. At night, a lake reflects city lights. Marty leads Anna to a car. She gets in back and gazes at the unseen driver.",
    "908": "Purvis sits at the wheel. Anna averts her gaze. Purvis stares at the helpless informant. She gets out of the car. Purvis' gaze follows her as she walks around his vehicle. Holding a gun in his pocket, Dillinger peeks around a tree. He wears a straw boater hat and sports a trimmed mustache. He steps out to meet Piquett. They sit on a roadside park bench. Piquett reaches into his coat. Dillinger unfolds the page to reveal a handwritten message. I am too well guarded. Two years is not a long time anyway. Dillinger folds up the note. Dillinger stands and walks away. Piquett puts on his hat and heads off in the opposite direction. Now at a stone wall, Dillinger, Alvin Karpis, and other men look down at an idling steam locomotive. Alvin turns away from Dillinger, who stares ahead. Anna sits at the kitchen table fanning herself with a magazine. Dillinger enters. He crosses the room. Anna's fanning motion slows as her knowing gaze follows him. Dillinger glances around the living room, then returns to the kitchen. He goes to the sink and washes his hands. Anna glances at the door. Polly emerges. He dries his hands with the towel and leads the way through the house to the front door. They leave. Our view returns to Anna, who remains at the table, covering her mouth with her hand. Madala crosses the field office to Purvis, who sits on a desk. Purvis eagerly talks the call. As he listens, Winstead looks up from a newspaper. Purvis lowers the phone and turns to his peers. The agents gather. All eyes turn to Winstead. Madala checks a newspaper. Dillinger pulls up to a building with Polly. They enter the building through a set of double doors. She goes off. Dillinger steps forward, casually chewing gum as he glances around. An elevator door opens. Dillinger steps aboard among a few other men, including a uniformed officer. He glances at the elevator operator. The door glides shut. He enters the quiet office, passing a row of empty chairs against the wall of a waiting area. Daylight shines in through a window. Dillinger hikes up his pants as he enters the main office. He turns to a bulletin board where multiple mug shots of familiar criminals hang posted. He crosses to a desk and holds briefly by a secretary busy typing. A couple of yards ahead, an agent on the phone sits at his desk, unaware of Dillinger's presence. The gangster finds another bulletin board and scans its postings. A mug shot of Homer, photos of a robbed bank and a sprawled body, and a street map. A smile crosses Dillinger's lips as he passes through a brilliant shaft of sunlight.",
    "909": "Farther along the bulletin board, he finds black and white photos of himself. Others show more buildings. Dillinger lowers his sunglasses and views photos of the Little Bohemia Lodge, the wrecked Ford, and a pair of confiscated Tommy gun. He crosses to a bulletin board showing mug shots of Billie. The last mug shot of Dillinger himself remains unstamped. Dillinger lowers his shades and meets his mug shot's stern gaze. Dillinger rounds a corner and spies a group of agents around the radio. One man glances over. Unrecognized, Dillinger moves on. In a cinema lobby, using a public phone, a fair-haired agent scans the surrounding. Elsewhere, another agent ends the call. Gazing across the street, he shakes his head. At the wheel of a parked car, Madala looks to Purvis, seated shotgun. By a lamp's modest light, a shaving kit lies open on a small, round table. A handgun lies beside it. Facing a mirror, Dillinger drags a razor down his lathered cheek. He finishes shaving and opens his pocket watch, eying Billie's photo and the time. He shuts the watch, puts it away, and pockets the gun. Parked near the Biograph, Purvis tensely rubs his thin-lipped mouth. At the box office, a few anonymous patrons mill into the theater. The agent looks away, shifting his anxious gaze. He gets out of the car and paces down the sidewalk. He stops, turns, and puts his back to the cinema. Behind him, a man arrives with two blonde women, one of them in a conspicuous orange skirt. Purvis blinks, then looks over his shoulder. Spotting the trio, he looks away. Entering the packed house, the crime boss leaves Anna at her seat, then proceeds down the aisle with Polly. They find adjacent seats as opening titles appear on the screen. In the packed audience, Dillinger stares intently at the screen through his spectacles. Outside, Purvis addresses his agents. Purvis pats Winstead's shoulder. The team splits up. In the movie house, the crowd watches figures on screen playing hockey, then Clark Gable washing his hands in a men's room. Another character walks in. Dillinger gazes at the screen with a boyish smirk. Gable shoots the man. Sitting on her own, Anna turns, peeking nervously over her shoulder. She faces the screen again, her chest heaving. Outside, the agents take their positions. Winstead and Hurt duck into a storefront's recessed entryway. In the movie house, Dillinger watches the screen with a furrowed brow. Leading lady Myrna Loy stares with her mouth agape. Dillinger gazes at her with a knitted brow and clenched jaw. In a fur-collared coat, the exotically pretty actress wears a pensive expression. Later, she shifts her sober gaze. Later still, she turns away from a door clad in black.",
    "910": "Taking a deep breath, she manages a brave nod. Blinking back tears, she opens the door and hurries out. Clark Gable stares after her. Dillinger watches with shining eyes. Outside, Purvis checks his watch. Posted near the box office, he looks across the street. Winstead and Hurt wait patiently in the recessed storefront. Purvis turns, gazing toward the cinema lobby. On the movie screen, Clark Gable faces William Powell. He dons a cocky smile. Dillinger watches with a defiant smirk. On screen, Gable turns away from Powell, who draws a deep breath and heads into a cellblock. A guard follows, closes a prison door, and locks it. Outside the theater, Purvis digs a box of matches from his pocket and takes one out. From his breast pocket, he produces a cigar and holds it ready. Movie screen. Gable makes his way down the cellblock, flanked by guards. Dillinger wears a faint, sad smile as Gable faces a fellow convict. Dillinger wears a faint half-smile, his eyes shining. Outside, Purvis shifts his tense, vigilant gaze. In the movie house, words on the screen. The patrons stand, filing out of their rows. Anna tensely gets to her feet and looks around. A few rows down, Dillinger stands with Polly and dons his straw hat. Outside, Purvis watches the exiting patrons. At the storefront, Winstead and Hurt stand ready. In the parked car, the burly agent sweats at the wheel. His right hand trembles severely. He uses his left to steady it. Near the cinema door, Purvis watches movie patrons exiting the lobby. He faces the street, strikes the match, and lights his cigar. With a hostile sneer, the burly agent rushes out of the car. Dillinger steps into plain view, walking between Anna and Polly. The crime boss smiles thoughtfully. His younger friend wears a carefree grin. Keeping her pace, Anna holds a dour expression. Shoving a bystander aside, Purvis heads down the sidewalk after them. The burly agent joins the flow of foot traffic with his gun raised. Martin Zarkovich notices and roughly pushes two bystanders out of his way. Purvis moves with a deliberate stride and steady gaze. Across the street, Winstead and Hurt leave the recessed storefront. Meanwhile, the burly agent scowls, holding his aim as he gains on the crime boss. A few yards ahead, Dillinger frowns. He maintains his wide swagger. Our view hovers at the back of Dillinger's head. Then we see him frown. He looks over his shoulder and halts. As he and the burly agent lock gazes, the G-man's breathing grows shallow. He lowers his gun on him. Dillinger reaches into his pocket. Purvis tries to push between a couple. Winstead shoves between another pair, then brushes a man aside.",
    "911": "As Purvis struggles against the angry civilian, Winstead advances. Dillinger sees him just feet away gripping a pistol. Slack-jawed, Purvis relaxes his aim as Winstead lines up a shot. The bullet pierces the back of Dillinger's skull and exits through his cheek, spewing blood and tissue. Two crimson stains bloom on his shirt front, as Hurt fires twice from behind. Dillinger falls face down, eyes staring off, as blood streams from his ruptured cheek. Purvis stares, then ventures forward. As Dillinger lies dying, his lips move. Winstead removes his hat, crouches and leans his ear close to Dillinger. The agent narrows his eyes, glances at the fallen man and withdraws, revealing Dillinger's lifeless stare. Winstead gets to his feet, his sober gaze locked on the dead man. He holsters his gun and Purvis joins his side. As the younger G-man eyes the body, Winstead dons his hat, his air stoic and grim. The older man faces him. Purvis eyes him long and steady. Winstead glances away, then looks Purvis in the eye. Marty leans in for a good look at Dillinger's body, then heads off. Polly averts her gaze. Purvis takes another look at the body. A dozen civilians from the movie house rubber-neck as they move closer to the scene. A few yards off Anna glances over her shoulder and slips away. Before the growing crowd, a man lights a flare and holds it aloft. A few men swap grins and chat. The scene draws more Chicagoans from across the street, and more flares illuminate the area with searing light. The armed federal agents struggle to maintain order. Someone's hand blocks our view. A camera flashes over Dillinger's body. Winstead lights a cigarette and pensively looks away. More onlookers converge on the scene. Policemen help the agents manage pushy photographers. Purvis leaves the scene, silhouetted against the flares sallow light. Behind him, the glow and the smoke fill the air, blotting the crowd from view. More civilians rush in. From overhead, we gaze down at the chaos, as we withdraw. Winstead sits at a table in a small room with white brick walls. In a cellblock, a matron escorts Billie. Clad in a simple gray dress, she wears a dull expression. As the matron ushers her to another, the prisoner maintains her dispassionate gaze. In the visiting room the door opens. Winstead stands as Billie enters. She stares guardedly at him, then takes the seat facing his. Winstead sits. Leaning forward, he faces her with a knitted brow. Billie swallows, blinks her glistening eyes. Then gives a stony nod. Billie glares coldly. Winstead opens a gold cigarette case and briefly thumbs the contents. He turns the case, offering the grieving woman a cigarette.",
    "917": "Dillinger wriggles his opened pants downward. Billie, kneeling over him, unfastens her dress. She pulls it off over her head, revealing a silvery blue slip, then leans over on top of Dillinger. Glimpses of Dillinger thrusting into Billie from behind, interspersed with their nuzzling face to face. A recent flashback shows them arriving ecstatically. Another flash shows Dillinger kiss her mouth. His face withdraws down her chest. Later, as they cuddle, they share a warm smile. Later still, Billie strolls in her slip to a window. Open suitcases occupy every inch, filled to the brim with neatly packed clothes. Billie caresses their contents, then rejoins Dillinger in bed. She lays her head on his shoulder. Rolling over to face her, he strokes her cheek and neck. His thumb gently rubs her graceful jaw line. His gaze pours over her face. He grins. Billie gazes dreamily at him. He gives her another smile. His thumb caresses her cheek in a gentle rhythm. He flashes a puckish grin. At the telephone exchange, Baum stands with a listening piece to his ear and a hand-held mike at his lips. Later, the Pierce-Arrow pulls up to a curb. Purvis drives with Baum at his side. Two other G-men approach the luxury car. One of the street agents looks to his young partner, who bows his hat. Purvis faces Baum. He points, then gets out and faces the young G-man. Purvis leads them across the street towards a building. Inside, they enter a long, dim hallway. Purvis leads Agent Barton to a door, then readies his hand on his gun. We watch the agents from afar as they prepare, dwarfing their trench-coated forms. Purvis lifts his knuckles to the door. It opens, revealing a young demure house dressed. Her strawberry blonde hair frames her face in a curly bob. Purvis steps toward the doorway. As he enters, Barton lingers in the hall. At a table, a stout man eats. The baby-faced man nods. She steps away. Returning, the woman shows off her shoes. She holds out the opened wallet as well. Purvis eyes it and gives a nod. Purvis leaves, shutting the door. The woman looks wearily to the stout gentleman at the dining table. Now Purvis and Barton enter a stairwell. Purvis hurries downstairs. Rushing from the building, he runs across the street to agent Baum. In the stairwell, Barton peers through a window in the door. Squinting, he steps into the hallway and lets the door swing shut behind him. From the stairwell, our gaze lingers on the door, then drifts over to a set of elevators. One of them opens, revealing a tall man with rugged features. He steps off and heads for the door.",
    "918": "In the hallway, Barton sees the rugged man behind him. The stranger stops. Behind Barton, the stout, baby-faced man steps into the hall and shoots him. The G-man lurches and falls. In the street, Purvis turns. The shooter and his rugged associate leave. Outside, Purvis races toward the building. Baum whips out his gun, then peers at a car parked in the alley. Inside, Purvis enters the hallway and raises his gun. He advances cautiously. Purvis stops, looking down. Glancing whirly ahead, he crouches. Purvis' mouth drops open as he stares downward. On the floor, a blood pool spreads beneath Barton. As the wounded man twitches feebly, Purvis watches with a clenched jaw. His expression grows solemn. He glares down the hall. He rises, leaving a lifeless Barton. Outside, Baum sees two men hurrying down the alley steps. The baby-faced shooter raises a Tommy gun. The G-man ducks behind a wall as bullets pepper its surface. Scrambling out, he takes cover behind a garden planter. As the two criminals get into the parked car, Baum pops up and returns fire. The car pulls away. Back indoors, Purvis bursts into the apartment. He ignores the panic maul and leans out an open window. As the car below quits the alley, Purvis shoots, then hurries out of the apartment. Outside, two agents pull their car up as their superior exits the building. Purvis stops, staring with his mouth agape. The agent shifts his rueful gaze. With a slow, deliberate stride, Purvis steps closer to his men. Purvis' frustrated gaze scans the agents. His breath puffing visibly in the night air, he steps away. A bank's doors open. Three men in long coats enter. Our gaze drifts up to find Pete between Dillinger and a heavyset thug. The two leaner men split off together. Pete encounters a guard, sucker punches him, and bangs his head against the counter. Without breaking his stride, Dillinger draws a gun in each hand. The bankers all obey. Pete shifts his aim. A banker leads Dillinger to a vault. Now in his office, Hoover talks on the phone. Hoover shifts his resentful gaze and works his jaw. In Chicago, Purvis grimly lowers the phone, then shifts his troubled gaze. A locomotive pulls into a station. Puffs of brake steam blast the unfazed travelers and workers on the platform. The heavy wheels slow to a halt. An older, smartly dressed man with wizened features disembarks flanked by two associates. He peers down the platform through beady eyes. The three newcomers make their way down the platform, suitcases in hand. Travelers mill about on the vast terminal's marble floors. The three arriving men pause, taking in their surroundings. Now at a shoeshine stand.",
    "920": "She looks out of a side window as rocks and crags skim past. Daylight falls through holes punched in the fuselage by another burst from the fighter. Bond nurses the stricken aircraft as the hunter swoops in for the kill. Eases the floor throttle forward. Dying engines belch smoke. Envelops the fighter's cockpit. Transport to avoid the smoke. Trapping the fighter between the larger plane and. Has to do the same, slowing. The fighter turns to avoid a collision and hurtles straight towards the rocks. He throws here a parachute. A red warning light shows generator failure. She venches open the outside door for Bond, who gropes for his chute, then hauls on the stick to get out of the plane over the hill. Brown slamming the plane, As the two aircraft nearly collide. Bond raises the nose, gaining as much height as possible. Cargo strains in its straps, which snaps back towards Camille. Both propellers give out under the strain. Bond drops down vertical fuselage to Camille. He grabs her, and they tumble out into space. Parachute, lets go of her another dive for her as the plane and they continue to fall. M sits stony faced. They are in the sunless steps of the sinkhole. He puts his jacket around her shoulders. He stands, thinks for a moment and then turns to her. They stare at one another until Bond breaks eye contact. She gives a small nod. He holds out her hand she takes it and pulls herself up. They trudge through the chilly, rocky shadows. They come to a rock fall. Bond kicks at some of the stones and picks one up. He starts to climb up the rock fall. Comes to the top and pauses. Seeing a huge underground lake. They walk down a tunnel with the roof held up by wooden supports. People cluster around. People queue for water and argue amongst themselves. A man climbs up to peer in it, but the well is dry. A stand pipe stops dribbling. The bus arrives at the dying town. A small grooup of people joined by Bond and Camille get on board. The bus red tail lights shine through the dusty. Covered in dust. Arrive at the Grand Hotel. He heads unhurriedly upstairs, makes his way across the landing and approaches the door of his room. He pushes it open. He bursts into the bedroom. Fields' body is on the bed covered in black oil. He is frisked and escorted out. Breaks another's knee and lays out the third. He grabs the keys and unlocks his handcuffs, then frisks his would be captors. As the lift doors open, he cocks the automatic and calmly slips it into the waistband of his trousers in the small of his back.",
    "921": "He flips a dangling leg back into the lift as the doors close and intercepts M. He vaults a balustrade into the balcony above the lobby, avoiding the squads of agents looking for him. He is back past M. She gives a half smile as Bond leaves the building. In a dingy building, two men are carrying a heavy box downstairs. In an office, Felix swigs from a bottle. Felix puffs on his cigar as Bond hangs up. In a rundown part of town, men are drinking, smoking and playing games in a bar. Felix walks in to join Bond who is at the bar. A guy in a leather jacket walks to the bar. A soldier in armor. He sprints upstairs and takes out a waiting soldier with an elbow to the face. Another opens up, sprints off and jumps from one building to another. Felix observes the chaos dispassionately and sips his beer. Beam looks concerned as Felix gets in the car. Bond emerges from the shadows of a balcony onto the rundown street. The sun blazes down on a rocky desert. The general, police chief and guard sit on a cool balcony surveying the arid scene. The general leers after the slim hostess. The police chief wags a knowing finger at him. Behind a rock overlooking the geometrically laid out compound, Camille expertly assembles and loads an automatic. Two cars approach. She stares at him. She looks coldly at him. To an underground entrance. Parties converge along metal walkways and staircases. They arrive at a meeting area surrounded by clear glass panels. There is a display of shiny metallic balls nearby. Green's party arrive, his grim-faced driver carrying two metal attache cases. Greene grins at the general. The hostess brings the general's beer. She removes the beer. A document is placed on the table. Green slides it over to the general with a pen. Camille vaults over the edge of the compound's main building and drops onto the balcony. The general eyes Green grimly and grabs the paper. The second case is placed in front of him. He opens it and examines the wads of bank notes inside. He leaves the table as Green and his men grin smugly. Inside the building, Camille is heading in their direction. She hides in a doorway as the general and his bodyguard. She composes herself. The police chief heads downstairs to his four by four and dumps the money on the backseat. The general's men stand guard at his suite as Green's party head for the car park. Rips her clothes. Camille breathes deeply. Drops onto the police chief's car. He shoots the chief in the head. He clings to the bumper as the driver reverses.",
    "922": "The chief's Land Rover reverses into a wall, which explodes in a fireball. Bond is hurled against a wall and showered with glass. Huddled beneath a car, Bond fires at legs, the only targets he can see. Then he is up and running. He slams a man in a car door, runs to the stairs and takes down Green's driver. Camille shoots the general's guards and kicks one so hard he flies over a railing. The general gets off the hostess. Camille rips off her shirt and stands ready in a stroppy white top as Green bounds up the stairs. He places his German friend as armed guard. Enters the general's room. The hostess, hands bound, runs for the door and is batted aside by Camille who is then attacked by the general. He knocks the gun from her hand and slaps her. Bond runs upstairs. He is aimed at by Green's man just as the compound's main fuel cells erupt, engulfing the meeting area in flames and flying glass. The German is consumed in the fire. But Green runs up the stairs, pursued by Bond. Bond is above Green on the flat glass roof. He fires down and the glass disintegrates. He drops back into the building. Green attacks with a metal bar. Bond drops his gun. Green grabs an ax from a fire point and flails wildly at Bond. The general has Camille by the throat. He pulls off the edge of the floor they are on and dangles in space. Bond, holding him by the hair. Camille struggles desperately under her attacker, grabs his groin and kicks him in the face. She dives for the gun. Camille breathes deeply. Bond hauls Green back up by the hair and dumps him on the floor. Fire falls through the ceiling. Bond runs to her aid. Camille sits crouched in terror, as fire and masonry fall around her. The building is collapsing as Bond tries to reach her. He spots her through the flames, puts his arms around her as the ceiling continues to crack by fire and falling rubble. Bond holds her tightly, spots the gun and picks it up. Her eyes are wide with terror. He is about to kill them. A burst exposes a fuel cell in the wall. The blast takes out the whole side of the building. Green has got clear. Bond watches him go as he and Camille clamber down the rubble. Dragging his injured foot. A plume of dust appears in the barren, empty desert. Bond is behind the wheel of a car. He stops, gets out and flings Green to the ground. Pulls a can of oil from the trunk. Green stares down at the can and at the car as it drives away across the vast, empty.",
    "929": "As Bond walks calmly down the corridor, Greene and his party are hurrying for an exit. They come face to face. On stage guns are drawn. The hero is shot on stage as men chase Bond. He runs through a crowded restaurant and shots are fired taking down a bystander. Bond waits in ambush. A pursuer goes gun battle ensues in the restaurant. Bond escapes into the kitchen area. A man body checks him, but Bond shoots him pointblank through the body. He ducks as a door flies open in front of him. He tips over a pan of oil which bursts into flames and gets past the gunman as the hero dies bloodily on stage. He marches the man away with a gun at his neck. He holds the guy at the edge of a roof. Greene gets in his car and Bond's prisoner tries to break free. He sends him off the roof. He lands on Greene's car. Bond straightens his tuxedo. The grim driver gets out and finishes him. In London, an operator is looking at Bond's photos. M stares at her screen. He registers surprise. He walks pensively away from the desk then goes back. He grins and walks off. Bond is in the back of a powerboat flying an Italian flag at the stern. The boat is heading towards a promontory topped by a grand villa overlooking the turquoise blue sea. Bond approaches a stout wooden door. She can't walks off. He drops photos on the table and helps himself to white wine. Bond grins. Mathis looks up at his glamorous younger woman. Bond drains a glass. In a bar on a plane, he looks at a picture of the dead Vespa and picks up a necklace from the bar. He sips a martini. Mathis joins him. He slips the photo into his pocket. They study one another. Bond stays at the bar. Bond and Mathis move through immigration. A redhead in a raincoat stands waiting. They get in the taxi which drives through the busy downtown traffic. They get down from the taxi and Fields strides into a rundown hotel. Bond heading back to the taxi. She obeys, tight-lipped. The statue of an eagle spreads its wings beneath a blue sky dusted with clouds. They are still bickering. They are led through the airy tile and marble halls. Bond casually tosses the keys on a sofa and strides through the spacious, modern furnishings eyed by Fields. She stands looking lost as he casts a critical eye over the bedroom and marble on-suite bathroom. He takes off his jacket and walks into the bathroom. Fields grins, and goes to the bedroom. Bond answers the door naked.",
    "931": "On a page of parchment, the Warner Brothers shield. Warner Brothers Pictures, a Time Warner company. The page turns to a set of interlocking V's. Village Roadshow Pictures. Another page turn reveals L shapes and a set of two broken squares with a small square in the center. A pocket watch on a chain lies on a desk beside typewritten sheets, on top of which rests a magnifying glass. Sitting at the typewriter is a man in his late 30s with dark hair and a neat mustache. A marquee in front of a cathedral erupts in flames, and smoke billows out over bodies on the ground. A man in a frock coat carries a brown paper package under his right arm. As he passes a woman in a wide-sleeved outfit, he transfers the package to her. The pretty, dark-haired woman with a hat perched jauntily on her head is Irene Adler. Sherlock Holmes, disguised as an Oriental man, lies on a mattress in the street smoking a pipe. He sits up. Holmes grabs handfuls of rice and coffee beans and places them in a bag. Irene strides through the open market. Ahead of her, a man tosses an apple. Irene walks down steps. She stops and twirls. Holmes walks up and takes her arm. He swapped a loaf for the package. He pulls her aside. She glances round at them. She leads him by the hand into an alley. The swarthy man who was tossing the apples steps out in front of them. She takes the package back from him. She leaves him with the loaf. The swarthy man studies Holmes' shabby disguise, then whistles. Holmes removes his spectacles as the three men facing him close in. They slap the bread away and rip off his fake, droopy mustache and ill-fitting wig. He turns. The swarthy man grabs him by the neck and throws him against a fence. Holmes kicks the man, then punches him. He throws rice in one of the thug's face, ducks as another throws a punch and instead hits his colleague. Holmes makes a good account of himself, then is pressed back against the slatted wooden fence and chains are wrapped round his wrists. As the leader closes in with a crate, Holmes spits coffee beans into his face. Holmes manages to duck beneath the crate swung at him and kicks an attacker to the ground. They step back as they see two uniformed policemen on the beat. Holmes slumps to the ground. The swarthy man tosses coins at him. The man does a little skip. The peelers walk away. The man starts to whistle again. Holmes is crouched on the ground, as if in a trance.",
    "932": "Holmes spots a bit of material, a piece of bloodstained wood, a dollop of mortar, and a stain. In his mind's eye, he sees mortar being churned and some spilt. A carpenter cuts his finger, spilling blood. Sacks are used as counterweights and a door handle is disguised as a coat peg. A mechanism turns. The workmen open a bottle of wine and some is spilled, staining the floor. Holmes eyes the coat pegs. He pulls on one of the coat pegs and a secret door opens. Watson draws a sword from a stick and cuts the rope holding the sandbag. The door swings shut behind them. Holmes lights a flaming brand. They look around the secret room and see a printing press and, on a table, sticks of dynamite. Holmes eyes a plaque reading, Imperata. Leading the way with his flaming torch, Holmes heads off down a dark corridor. They go up a flight of stone steps, push a metal grill open and emerge on a dark street beneath a bridge. They climb up onto the bridge and look out towards the opera house. As they get close to the building, they push their way through crowds outside. Inside, the performance is underway. Sim, Holmes, and Watson enter the opera house through the stage door. As they make their way backstage, they don't notice Moriarty's agent lurking in the shadows. He gets up and, puffing on a dark cigarette, watches them go by before heading off in the opposite direction. Holmes, Watson, and Sim walk past stagehands in the wings. A couple of them try to stop them but they ignore the men's protests. Holmes spots a plaque, Imperata, and thinks back to the dynamite beside the one in the secret room. He imagines a bomb with a timing device beneath the stage. Holmes walks over to one of the stagehands and flings him out of the way. He gestures to Sim who tosses him a knife. Holmes climbs under the stage and cuts a hole in a sheet of canvas. He looks up and sees the word Imperata is part of the print on which the statue of Commendatore is standing. Holmes is now inside the plinth. Onstage, the Commendatore points a finger at. Holmes peals away a backing cloth from the word Imperata. Inside the plinth he finds a black chess piece concealed in the O. He picks the chess piece up and sees Moriarty sitting in a box, watching the performance and possibly him, through a pair of opera glasses. Holmes rips his way out of the back of the statue of the Commendatore and hurries across the stage to the wings where Sim and Watson are waiting beside a couple of actors in demon costumes.",
    "933": "He shows Watson the chess piece. In the auditorium, Moriarty watches the performance, apparently spellbound. Holmes, Watson, and Sim hurry into the street and make their way towards the Hotel de Triomphe. The cake containing the bomb is being delivered to the hotel by the rough looking man and his identical accomplice. In a meeting room at the hotel, Meinhard is making a speech. Holmes and the others race towards the hotel. Meinhard turns to look at the cake, which explodes. Out in the street, Holmes and the others see a massive fireball erupt from the hotel. In the opera house, Don Giovanni throws himself at the feet of the Commendatore statue. Moriarty watches, transfixed, as demons surround Don Giovanni. Holmes, Watson, and Sim run into the hotel and survey the carnage. The demons close in around Don Giovanni. The statue sinks into the ground. In the hotel, Holmes finds Meinhard's body and looks at a ring on the little finger of the dead man's left hand. Looking around, Holmes spots a bullet hole in a wall. He pulls a small telescope out of his jacket and, through it, sees another bullet hole in a window nearby. Beyond it, in the distance, there's a statue on top of a building. Later, he, Watson, and Sim are up on the building, beneath the statue. Holmes imagines a rifle. Moriarty's agent is the sniper. He wedges it in an ornate carving. Holmes recalls entering the opera house. Moran loads his Martini action rifle and aims it at Meinhard. He takes his shot. Day, the Eifel Tower. Sim and Watson are sitting at a table outside a cafe at the foot of the tower. Holmes, disguised as an old man, is sitting at a nearby table, listening. Once Moriarty and Moran have gone, he leaps to his feet and dashes off down the back staircase. He pulls off his wig and tosses it to a waiter. Nearly colliding with another waiter, he dons a bellhop's uniform and removes his mustache just in time to intercept Moriarty and Moran in the lobby. Sim takes Watson's hat. She exchanges it for a battered old hat. Holmes eyes the horse uncomfortably. Watson pulls her face. Sim, Watson, and a group of gypsy men ride through the forest. Trailing in their wake comes Holmes, astride a very small pony. The gypsies gallop on through the woods. Holmes bumps along uncomfortably on the pony's saddle. They stop a little way away from a border post. Holmes watches through this telescope as troops stop people crossing. Holmes looks disgruntled at the prospect of more riding. He passes the gypsies as they have a break. The gypsies stare after him as he trots by.",
    "934": "They gallop after him, catching him up. As the gypsies walk the horses along a narrow track, one of them rears up. They look up and see Holmes astride his pony on a higher track above them. They follow him. It's getting dark as they arrive beside a lake. A town sits in the distance across the water. Holmes talks to Watson as they stand beside the horses. Sim, Watson, and Holmes exchange nods, then Holmes and Watson head up. Holmes and Watson crouch low in the darkness as six armed guards march past. All clear, they get to their feet. Holmes pulls a face. Taking the folded-up piece of paper from Holmes, Watson sets off. Holmes crouches and takes another sheet of paper from his pocket. He starts to write. Across the complex, Watson lurks outside the closed telegraph office. He glances around, then kicks the door in. At the munitions factory, Holmes climbs over a barred gate and leaps to the ground. In the telegraph office, Watson pushes open a glass-paned door. Holmes scurries through the munitions factory yard. He hides behind a wooden beam. People walk past the telegraph office. Watson dons a cap. He taps out the message given him by Holmes. Holmes walks along the side of a row of wooden crates. He passes a rack of large, upright mortar shells. He goes to a metal door and opens it. He steps inside, stops and stares. The room contains a number of worktables with machinery. He strolls through it and notices something. He stops by a shell and screws open its tip. He lifts it up. A glass container is attached to the metal tip. It contains a yellow liquid. Holmes sniffs it and puts it down. Holmes continues to wander through the machine room and comes to another metal door with a glass window in it. He peers through it into a command center. An operations tabletop is covered by a map and models on blocks. One is a model machine gun, another a sniper rifle. He sees drawings of a semiautomatic pistol, a revolver, and an automatic light artillery gun. On the wall map, an image of a cannon times 35,500 and an image of a heavy gun times 15,000. Watson leaves the telegraph office and comes down the steps. Holmes enters another room. He closes the door and walks across a balcony towards a metal rail. He leans on the rail and gazes down into the dark interior. In the dim light, he sees row upon row of artillery shells. The lights come on, and he sees the full extent of the number of shells. Holmes turns to Moran and throws down his pistol.",
    "935": "Holmes sees a stack of long-barreled pistols. He tosses a magazine to Holmes and nods for him to load it. The identical thugs come up behind Holmes. One grabs the gun. The other holds a piece of cloth over Holmes' mouth and nose. His eyes close, and he sinks to the floor. Watson returns to the spot where he left Holmes. He finds a note pinned to a crate and reads it. He turns it over. He opens up the folded paper to see Rene's sketch of a tall tower. He glances up at a lit tower nearby, then moves off. A small glass with liquid in it is held under Holmes' nose. He stirs. Watson goes nearer to the tower. Moriarty turns to Holmes. A guard had apprehended Watson. Moran shot the guard to get an aim on Watson. A meat hook is slammed into Holmes' shoulder, and he's hauled up on a rope. Moriarty lowers a stylus on a gramophone record. He holds a telephone in front of the horn speaker. The music is broadcast over a speaker into the yard, where Watson cowers in the darkness as Moran keeps a rifle trained from a walkway high up on the tower. Moriarty accompanies the singer. Clutching the rope attached to the hook in his shoulder, Holmes is swinging about a meter off the floor. Moriarty pushes him. Moran shoots at Watson. The bullet ricochets off a metal pole. Moriarty spins Holmes around. Watson breaks cover. Moran shoots and Watson ducks behind a platform. Holmes' screams are audible over the tenor. Watson climbs a ladder on the platform. Holmes spins in the air. Moran takes aim. His shot passes through a narrow gap between pieces of machinery, just missing Watson. Moriarty indicates to a henchman to lower Holmes to the ground. Watson holds his hat up to the gap in the machinery, and Moran puts a bullet straight through it. Watson looks around and sees a pair of ear defenders hanging on the wall. Moriarty rolls his eyes wearily and bends over Holmes, gripping the meat hook embedded in his shoulder with one hand and Holmes' uninjured arm with the other. Moran watches the piece of machinery. A cover falls off it. It's an artillery cannon. Moran retreats. Moran desperately climbs down the tower to escape from the cannon Watson is operating. Watson fires the cannon at the tower. It collapses, smashing through the roof of the building where Holmes and Moriarty are. As the dust settles, Watson sits up on the platform wearing the ear defenders. He climbs down from the platform and runs over to the now ruined building. He searches through the debris. He finds Holmes half-buried under the rubble.",
    "938": "Holmes drinks the contents of the vial Watson handed him. It appears to have no effect. Suddenly, Holmes opens his eyes wide and stares around wildly. He leaps to his feet. Watson yanks out the large splinter of wood. Holmes relaxes a little, as Watson examines his foot. Watson smiles wistfully for a moment. Watson tosses down a medical instrument and looks down thoughtfully. Watson exchanges a surprised look with Sim. Watson regards Holmes for a moment then leans back against the side of a box car with a resigned expression. In Switzerland, an imposing castle is perched on a mountainside. The building saddles a massive waterfall. Watson and Sim join Mycroft for dinner in a snow-covered lunch. Holmes puts it down. Delegates are arriving at the castle, expanding their back falls, which stumble hundreds of feet vertically down the mountainside. A horse-drawn sleigh arrives at the castle with Moriarty aboard. He got an elegant figure and top hat and overcoat. He gets out of the sleigh and goes into the castle. The Maitre D' has a book containing photos of all the delegates. He identifies and welcomes the new arrival. Moriarty steps forward. In a ballroom, elegant couples in evening wear or military dress uniform dance across the floor. Holmes joins Mycroft, the others, and Watson at the edge of the dance floor. They're all wearing white tie and tails. Samantha is wearing a deep red dress. Holmes holds his hand out. Sim takes it. They step onto the dance floor. They and the other couples whirl around in circles across the floor. Holmes looks a bit out of place, his face being unshaven and heavily bruised. He observes the other people in the room. A man's hand rests on the hill to the sword. He observes details of the people in the ballroom. A woman's necklace, a man's medals, a military man holding white glass, an eye cross spinning to a white uniform. Holmes scans the faces of the people. His eyes settle on the man in a black uniform. He has a facial scar. Holmes looked thoughtfully at Sim and steers her back over to Watson. He gestures to Watson. Arm and arm, they take to the dance floor. He works on the man's face. A man is chloroformed. Watson nods. Holmes walks over to a footman in 18th Century costume including a white parted wig and handsome letter. Footman nods and takes it. Holmes leaves the ballroom. Watson walks over to Sim and whispers in her ear. She looks surprised. Moriarty chats with a delegate, wearing an orange saf. The footman approaches Moriarty and hands him Holmes' letter. Moriarty reads it and looks around in concern.",
    "946": "A soldier opens a crate and takes out a Maxim machine gun. The weapon is fixed onto its tripod and the belt-fed ammunition loaded into the breech. The weapon is cocked. Then the soldier opens fire. Bullets rip through the walls of the first class compartments, showering Watson and Holmes with debris. Holmes hands Watson a pistol. The lipstick he put in the machine gun belt is fed into the breech, jamming the gun. Watson shoots through the hole created by the machine gun bullets. He hits a soldier who drops a grenade. The soldier Watson hit realizes he's inadvertently pulled the pin out of the grenade which then dropped back into a bag full of grenades. The grenades explode, blasting the train in two. Watson and Holmes sit in the ruined lavatory of their carriage which is at the end of those still attached to the engine. A flashback to her falling from the train. Mycroft appears in a boat. Holmes, whose face is covered in smeared lipstick and eye shadow, waits awkwardly for the answer. Watson smiles ruefully at the mention of Paris. The train rattles on through the night. Black smoke belches from the funnels of a paddle-steamer as it leaves the white cliffs of Dover behind. Watson and Holmes, now out of his disguise, are on the steamer's rear promenade deck. Watson takes Irene's monogrammed handkerchief out of Sims' bag and glances over at Holmes. Holmes takes the hanky and walks over to the railing. He sniffs the hanky, inhaling its scent, as he looks out to sea. Watson watches him closely. Holmes looks down at the hanky then glances over his shoulder at Watson before casually tossing it over the side. The paddle-steamer approaches the French coast. A flier posted on a wall in Paris advertises a lecture by Professor Moriarty. In a grand building, Moriarty is signing a copy of his book on asteroids for an admirer. He hands it back to the man. As another man comes up to have his book signed, the bearded agent sits beside Moriarty and passes him a note. Moriarty looks at the note then puts it in a leather covered notebook before signing another book. He turns to his agent as he autographs the book. The agent takes two tickets from his jacket pocket. The agent goes. Outside, he wanders over to a rough looking bloke leaning against a wall.",
    "947": "The man heads off. As bearded, middle-aged Meinhard gets out of a carriage outside of the Addrelle de Fleuve. The rough looking bloke is hovering nearby with another identical man. They keep an eye on Meinhard. At a gypsy camp in the countryside, men practice their horse riding skills. Holmes and Watson drive up on the outskirts of the camp in an open carriage. A man comes over to them and holds their horse. Watson calls over to a group of men then nudges Holmes, who appears to be asleep. The gypsy man indicates a bearded man holding a goose. The gypsies surround Holmes and Watson who smile politely. The man takes it. Then Watson knocks him cold. The atmosphere becomes more strained. A man opens his jacket, revealing a knife. Sim pushes through the crowd, holding her bag which the gypsies have taken off Holmes. The man Watson punched watches them as they eat a meal. Watson looks up from his bowl and frowns. Holmes glares at him. Sim hands the drawings to the gypsy man who passes them to Holmes. Holmes licks the red stain. Holmes turns conspiratorially to Watson. Holmes drinks from a proffered bottle as Watson gets up. Outside, Watson dances energetically with a gypsy. Sim joins in too. Holmes watches and twitches his shoulders in time with the music. At the castle home of Mycroft Holmes. Mary walks into a study and finds him completely naked. She takes it and reads it as Carruthers goes. She takes the telegram and goes. Stanley, the dithering ancient butler, turns around. Paris under a leaden sky. On a side street, a carriage, with Imperata stenciled on the side, pulls up. The back is opened and a man ushers Sim, Holmes, and Watson from it. They go into a building and pass two men wheeling a coat-of-arms shaped cake on a trolley. The man leads them into a busy kitchen. They make their way past chefs, busy at worktops, until they're stopped and searched by some other man. Holmes notes an empty baking tray and some royal icing in gold leaf laurels together with a shield and a newspaper on a worktop. He, Sim, and Watson are ushered down some stairs. They emerge in a basement room. A man sits at a table with his back to them. The man, Ravache, is eating. Watson sniffs a piece of paper. Holmes and Sims sit. Ravache takes a gulp of red wine and wipes his mouth with a napkin. Ravache sips his wine. Ravache shoots himself in the head. Upstairs in the kitchen, his colleagues hear the shot and run off to investigate. Holmes gets to his feet. As Watson fires warning shots up the stairs, Holmes stares into an alcove.",
    "957": "Joe and Alice are in his bedroom. He frantically tries to tidy up. He quickly hides an essay with a C minus grade. Looking embarrassed, he picks up a model train carriage. In her zombie makeup, Alice suddenly looks up at Joe. He smiles. Charles comes in. Deputy Tally shows Jack a map. Deputy Rosko pauses to tune in his radio. The Air Force is searching the house the kids are filming in front of. Jack drives up. The kids watch uncertainly as Jack takes the camera. Jack puts Joe in the back of his patrol car. He goes over to talk to Colonel Nelec. The Colonel's expression hardens. Jack steps back over to the colonel. Sitting in the patrol car, Joe watches as the two men shake hands. Later, Joe and Jack return home. With tears in his eyes, Joe glares at his father. Jack glares back at him, struggling to contain his emotions. Jack turns away and marches out of the house, leaving Joe looking bleak. A tear rolls down his cheek and he wipes it away with his hand. At dusk, Joe cycles up a steep hill and goes in through the gates of a cemetery at the top. He cycles on between the headstones. Joe sits silently staring into the distance. He looks down at his mother's locket which he holds in his hand. Hearing a noise, he looks up. He gets to his feet and takes a torch from his rock sack. He shines it on a building nearby. Looking through a window, he can see earth being tossed about inside the building. Spooked, he runs off. Jack drives his patrol car through the gates of Lilian Air Field. Inside the compound, his car is immediately surrounded by heavily armed soldiers. Nelec sits at Woodward's bedside. His face lacerated from the train crash, Woodward glares stonily back at the Colonel from his hospital bed. Nelec leans in closer to him. The Colonel gives him a hard stare and walks away from the bedside. His aide, Overmyer, injects toxin into Woodward's drip, and he begins to convulse. Overmyer watches this passionately as Woodward dies. The Colonel stands with his back to the bed and waits for it to go quiet. Back at home, Joe is awakened in the middle of the night by a knocking at his window. He gets up. He opens the window to Alice. She climbs in through the window. He takes her hand to help her down off the desk. He tries the light. A Cinay projector starts up. Alice moves forward to watch the film. The footage is of Joe as a baby with his mother. He sucks on her locket as she holds him.",
    "958": "Footage of his first birthday. His mother blows out a solitary candle on his cake. She picks him up in her arms. Now Joe is about three years old. His mother measures his height against the wall. She kisses a cut on his hand better. Joe watches as the footage changes to him with his mother at Christmas. On screen, she smiles as Joe holds up a present. He watches somberly as on screen, his mother picks him up and plays with him in the garden. She laughs into the camera. Un-shed tears form in Alice's eyes as she watches. Captured together on the home movie, Joe and his mother play together on some distant summer's day. Joe waves at the camera. Joe looks over at Alice. She's sitting with her back to him. Her shoulders heave and tears roll down her face. She struggles to find the words. Joe stares at her. Alice watches the last bit of footage which is of Joe's mother pushing him on a swing. The film runs out and spins around on the reel. Joe and Alice see the rattling noises coming from the strange cube Joe took from the crash site. It vibrates across the tabletop. Alice wipes the tears from her eyes. Joe picks up a pencil and gently prods the cube. It continues vibrating. He and Alice exchange a look. The cube shoots off the table and smashes through the wall leaving a hole in the wall and a poster of the space shuttle that pinned to it. Joe and Alice go over to the hole and peer through it. The lights of the tomb and the water tower can be seen in the distance through it. They exchange a look. Later, Alice carefully slips her key into her front door and opens it. She steps into the hall and puts the key in a dish on a side board. She sees Louis sitting in the front room. She goes in to him, and finds him smoking and drinking. Wounded, she runs outside, grabs her bicycle and rides off. Louis comes running out after her. Fighting back tears, Alice cycles grimly on, Louis comes after her in the yellow Coupe. She glances nervously over her shoulder as the V8 barrels after her. She rounds a corner and the coupe clips the curb as it takes the corner. Alice jams her brakes on and pulls a u-turn in the road. She cycles back past Louis. Taking his eye off the road, he careens into the back of a parked car. Hearing the impact, Alice stops and looks back. As she stares at the wreck, she doesn't notice a massive creature moving behind her.",
    "960": "Jack gets back in the Jeep. Now on a main carriage way, he unwittingly motors past Donnie and Joe and the boys who are driving back to town. Donnie takes a sharp right onto a rough track through the trees. As it's getting dark, they arrive back into town. They drive until Lillian Middle School. The boys leave Donnie in the car park and scramble over a chain link fence. They run to a storage trailer. Joe begins prying a padlock on the trailer with the tire iron. Martin opens it. There are papers and rolls of film inside. They break into a classroom. A photo of him. They look at the footage. Scientists and military men look at the wreckage of something big. Carrie puts a tape in a player. On the film, Woodward is grabbed by a tentacle. Air Force soldiers burst in on the boys. In the car park, Donnie sits in the car smoking a joint, oblivious of the military activity around him. The soldiers march the boys into a corridor. Colonel Nelec approaches them. He finds Carrie's explosives in his rock sack. Nelec eyes Joe. Overmyer finds his mother's locket on him and takes it. The soldiers shepard the boys onto a bus in the car park. Sitting in his car, Donnie watches as they're driven away. He gets on his CB radio. Still in Air Force uniform, Jack makes his way though the evacuation center. A boy recognizes him. Jack finds Preston reading a magazine. The super eight footage of the alien. On the bus the boys are in, Overmyer hands Colonel Nelec some paperwork. The boys watch anxiously from a holding cell at the rear of the bus. Something hit the side of the bus, jolting it over onto two wheels. It continues along the road a short way like this before righting itself. As it does so, one of its tires blows out. The driver brings the bus to a grinding halt on a remote road. A rifle. Nelec hands the rifle to an apprehensive looking Overmyer. The senior airman driving the bus hesitates before reluctantly obeying the order and opening the door. Outside it's pitch dark. Clutching the rifle, Overmyer cautiously makes his way along the aisle of the bus towards the open door. As he nears the door, Overmyer stops. A tentacle reaches into the bus and grabs Overmyer. The boys watch in horror as it slaps him against the walls of the bus. The rifle goes off hitting the window of the boys holding cell. Overmyer is dragged outside. Martin vomits. The senior airman restarts the bus's engine and it lurches into life. As he stamps on the throttle, the bus is tipped onto its side.",
    "965": "He makes a left turn and pounds through a puddle. At the Adjustment Bureau, an aide hurries up to Thompson. At the courthouse, Adrian greets Elise with a hug. As she steps by, he gazes after her. Meanwhile, David sprints through the downpour reaching the targeted blue door. He ports through and finds himself at a service counter at the New York DMV. A bewildered customer peers at the rainy street left exposed in the open doorway. David races out a lobby door. At the Bureau, Thompson and aides cross a room stocked with hats. Thompson halts, glances at his aides plan book, and rushes off. In the rain, a sprinting David holds a hand out to traffic. He dashes across the street and climbs the courthouse steps two at a time. In the lobby, he crashes into a bystander knocking him down. His hat comes off and a guard approaches. He grabs the hat. Adrian addresses Elise's friend. On her way out, she passes a gaunt stranger in a fedora. A bailiff signals him to take it off, and he does. In the lobby, he races to a metal detector, and wrenches off his jacket and empties his pockets. He slides it along the table as he darts through the checkpoint. Leaving his other belongings, he halts under a rotundas decorated ceiling. Later he runs up a spiral stairwell. Now as Thompson meets his team in the rotunda, David races past Elise's friend outside the courtroom. He bursts into the Ladies Room. She stares at him. The gaunt bureau officer enters. David coldcocks him. He picks up the officer's plan book, and shows it to Elise. An aide with Thompson consults his book. In the warehouse officers, clad from head to toe in black, get into SUVs. Meanwhile in the Adjustment Bureau. In the courthouse Ladies Room David braces a mop handle behind a radiator barring the door. He checks its sturdiness, then checks the deadbolt. Crossing to her, he puts on the fedora. David opens the closet door and ports them onto Yankee Stadium's grassy outfield. Elise gapes at the abrupt change and setting. David rushes her to a padded doorway in the playing field wall. It ports to a stairway. Climbing it, the couple find themselves in Manhattan's business district. Back in the courthouse Ladies Room, a bureau officer kicks in the door. Thompson and his team enter glancing briefly at their unconscious colleague. Meanwhile, David and Elise race hand in hand down the bustling city street. In the Ladies Room, Thompson notes the plan room lying open on the sink counter. His aide consults his own book. With David, she shakes her head. She nods. Now Thompson and his aide emerge from the underground stairway and arrive in the business district.",
    "967": "She grips two high heels, a coat, and an open champagne bottle which she sets on the counter. The woman sits on the counter. Her unblinking eyes stay on him. David straightens, his gaze fascinated. As David faintly nods, the smiling woman shakes her head. Their amused smiles relax as their stare lingers. David breaks the gaze. The two strangers gaze at each other, and then converge abruptly in a deep kiss, caressing each other passionately. As their kiss ends, their faces still hover close. A second onrush of kissing overtakes them. She loosens his tie. The woman jogs out barefoot. David follows her. She peers back. Charlie smiles. Two men approach. She hurries off. Now in the ballroom. Backstage Charlie and other aides applaud. David peers at his supporters, then briefly bows his head. He glances back stage. He holds up a shoe. Numerous flashbulbs pop. Now dark clouds drift over Manhattan. On a pleasant city street, largely devoid of activity. A shiny black town car stops by Madison Square Park. A rear passenger door opens. The oldest member of the mysterious four-man team from the rooftop gets out of the car in his fedora and overcoat. He confidently enters the park. Farther along, the mustached stranger sits on a bench. The older superior sits beside him. His superior walks away. The mustached subordinate peers after his boss with a faint smile. Across from the park, a well-kept residential building shows beyond a few trees. Inside David sleeps. He wakes and turns off his alarm clock, which reads six o'clock. Later, David sips coffee. Later, David carries a to-go cup of coffee as he crosses a park. As David and his fan go their separate ways, the mustached stranger remains on his park bench, his head bowed and his fedora brim tilted to shade his face. David hurries across a street. A clock on the side of a building reads 7.05. Sunlight glows through a tree's branches, bathing the stranger's face. He awakes. Blinking, he glances around, then pulls out his hardcover book and checks a bookmarked page. He jumps to his feet, spotting David, who boards a bus. The stranger races after it. David notices him through a bus window. The stranger keeps sprinting, as David looks for a place to sit. He smiles. The lovely woman from the election night sleeps with her head leaned against a window. As David takes the seat beside her, she stirs. David checks out her thighs and miniskirt. She notices him and beams. Outside, the mustached stranger still sprints after the bus. She stares at him. David grabs his phone. A car speeds past the running stranger. The bus pulls up to a stop.",
    "97": "A group of wounded soldiers hang out in the hospital, recuperating. Forrest turns the TV off and he is hit on the back of the head by a ping-pong ball. Forrest shakes his head. The wounded ping-pong player hands Forrest a paddle. Forrest and the wounded ping-pong player step toward the ping-pong table. He holds the ball up and moves it back and forth. Forrest keeps his eyes on the ball. The wounded ping-pong player tosses the ball down onto the table. Forrest begins to hit the ball back to the other player. Forrest hits ping-pong balls. The balls at land in a bed pan positioned on a chair. A group of wounded soldier sit and watch Forrest play with himself. Forrest hits two balls at a time against the opposite side of the table. Lt. Dan stares out the window. Forrest lies in his bed asleep. A hand reaches and grabs him. Lt. Dan pulls Forrest to the floor, and holds Forrest down. Lt. Dan looks at Forrest, lets go of Forrest and rolls. Lt. Dan sits up as Forrest looks at him. Forrest plays ping-pong by himself. An OFFICER walks up to him. The officer holds up an envelope. Forrest steps up to Lt. Dan's bed. Forrest stops in mid-sentence as he looks down at the bed. A heavily bandaged soldier with bloodstains lies there. Forrest turns and look at the NURSE. The television reveals Forrest as he is awarded the Medal of Honor by President Johnson. Color footage revealing President Johnson as he places the award around Forrest's neck and shakes hands. President Johnson leans and whispers into Forrest's ear. The television revealing Forrest as he drops his pants, bends over and shows the bullet wound on his bare buttocks. President Johnson looks down and smiles. The three men in the barber shop look up in disbelief. Mrs. Gump looks up in shock. Hilary leads the line of vets toward the large anti-Vietnam War rally. Hilary pulls Forrest up onto the stage. The other vets follow Forrest pushes onto the stage and push him toward the microphones. Abbie raises his fist as the crowd cheers wildly. Forrest looks at the crowd as he speaks. A policeman looks around as he sneaks over to the audio circuit board. The policeman pulls the patch cords out of the audio board. Forrest continues to speak into the microphone, even though no one can hear what he is saying. Hilary looks over and notices the policeman. Hilary rushes over toward the audio board, pushes the policeman away and grabs his night stick. Another protester grabs the policeman and pulls him away. Isabel, Hilary and another protester try to plug the tangled mess of wires back into the audio board.",
    "970": "David averts his gaze, his lips parted. He shifts his eyes, then shrugs. Charlie glances away. He eyes David, who presses his lips in a disappointed line. Now our view hovers above a stately, high-ceilinged reading room, where a center aisle separates dozens of large tables arranged perpendicularly to it. The mustached adjustment officer sits at one table with his hands folded. As men quietly work at other tables around him, some writing in slim books of their own, he shifts his contemplative eyes, then rises. He walks down the aisle. Now rains falls on the sidewalk in front of a ragtag neighborhood bar. Inside, David sits at the bar. He writes multiple iterations of Elise's phone number on a napkin. The mustached officer sits beside him. David glances down. Shifting his jaw, he glares indignantly at Harry. Harry glances skyward. David pinches the bridge of his nose. Harry glances over his shoulder. He lays the ticket on the bar. As Harry stands, David takes the ticket. Harry dons his newsboy cap and leaves. David stares contemplatively at the ticket. Now, on a ferry, passengers ride inside a covered seating area. A couple at the handrail gaze out at the city skyline. David finds Harry leaning against the railing at the boat's stern. David gives a nod. David gazes at the city. Now David heads down a crowded sidewalk. As he walks amid the flowing pedestrians, the screen fades to black. David lies on his back in bed and gazes out a window with a faraway look. Sunlight bathes his face as he rests his hands on his stomach. Shifting his gaze to the clock on his bedside table, he reaches over and turns off the alarm. Then drops his head back on the pillow. His chest heaves. Now, our view sweeps down the front of his towering apartment building. David exits, briefcase in hand. Starts down the sidewalk. In Madison Square Park, dead leaves litter the ground. David makes his way across, then waits at his bus stop. An M6 pulls up and he climbs aboard. Sliding his pass through the reader, he pauses in the aisle. His hopeful eyes find the empty pair of seats occupied three years earlier by Elise. He heads to them and sits. The bus pulls away from the curb. Outside, sunlight yawns across the side of a high-rise. David gazes out his window at a passing scaffold creating a canopied sidewalk by a construction site. A short distance ahead, he notices a dark-haired woman striding down the sidewalk. As the bus cruises past, he sees that it's Elise. Elise turns down a street behind the bus as it pulls over. David hurries off and races back up the sidewalk after her.",
    "973": "Inside, he crosses a huge marble lobby striped with shadows, then plods up a dark staircase. Later, he stands before double doors marked Mr. Donaldson. As he goes to knock, the clean-cut Donaldson steps out. They enter a wood paneled room through a door framed in green marble. The wall suggests an octagonal perimeter. They enter a records archive. They stop by a reference desk. The balding Burdensky opens a volume. On the opened historical pages, the circuit light pathways are unchanging. Meanwhile, David and Elise walk together. As they stroll through a park in the early evening, Elise throws her head back and laughs. Now, in the Adjustment Bureau reading room, Richardson finds Harry studying at one of the large tables. Back in the records room. With David and Elise. He runs. He easily stays ahead, running backward. She gut-punches him and runs ahead. She wins. Now ravers dance under bright flashing lights in a warehouse. David and Elise enter. David waves at partygoers. Elise loosens, then removes it. Later at a table, David swigs from a beer bottle. He shakes a guy's hand. As David and Elise talk, their faces close together, David grins. Elise jumps up and down, pumping her hands round his head. The ravers cheer as David dances with Elise. Later, she hugs him. Now they leave the party. Elise watches him with sorrowful eyes. He twitches a tender smile. He glances away and Elise gently rests a hand on his jacket lapel. As he gives her a sheepish grin, she reaches up to his face and strokes his cheek. Wrapping an arm around his shoulders, she leans forward and presses her lips to his. David returns the kiss, enveloping Elise in his arms. Later, in Elise's bedroom, David runs his fingers through her hair. She rests her hands on his bare back and he clasps her face as he kisses her passionately. Now he rolls on top of her in bed, his lips still pressed to hers. As they make love, he grips her hand and their fingers intertwine. David nuzzles Elise's chest. She runs a hand up the back of his neck, and he lifts his head briefly. Later, he spoons her as they sleep, his arm draped over her body. A withdrawing view of them reveals a suited man in a fedora, standing at the foot of the bed. With steely eyes, he watches the couple sleep, then turns away. Sunlight seeps between clouds and fills the sky. Elise sleeps alone in bed, the sheets beside her pushed down and rumpled. She jerks awake. Her startled look becomes relieved, and she touches her fingers to her brow. She notices the vacant spot beside her and sits up.",
    "974": "She glances around. She frowns to herself, her lips parted. She answers her cell. The front door opens, and David enters. She waves at David. She nods at the phone. David hands her a cup of coffee. David fixes his coffee in the kitchen of the one-room flat. She hangs up. Her phone shows four missed calls from Adrian. David looks up, knowingly. His thoughtful gaze drifts. She glances aside. Her lips spread into a sad smile. David blinks. He moves to a chair at her bedside. She meets David's gaze. Swallowing hard, Elise averts her eyes. As she looks at him again, she smiles wistfully. David gives her a contented look. Her eyes glimmer with tears as she meets his gaze. David crooks a smile. Elise's smile fades as she stares into David's earnest eyes. They gaze tenderly at each other. Blinking, David looks away. He juts out his jaw, then locks eyes with her. Now Elise sits in a green room. In the studio, David shakes Jon Stewart's hand, then waves to the audience. Meanwhile, a guy in a ball cap enters the green room. Her shoulders sag as the man leaves, and she collects her belongings. Now as David leaves the studio, the man in the ball cap opens the door for him. David texts as he walks through the doorway. Lifting his gaze from his phone, he finds himself in the Adjustment Bureau warehouse. He whips around to the closed door, but finds it locked. He tries another one, then attempts to lift a loading bay door. Now David sits with his back against a support beam. As he stares off, a figure appears. The steely-eyed adjustment officer approaches. Rising, David stares at him. David looks Thompson in the eyes. Thompson paces away from him. David follows. David observes Thompson, who stands still, his thoughtful eyes blinking. He shifts his gaze to a bay door and it begins to rise. With a determined look, David hurries past Thompson to the exit. The adjustment officer blinks his disapproving eyes. Meanwhile at Cedar Lake, dancers perform on one section of a low, L-shaped stage. As they twirl gracefully, male dancers leap across the other section, then drop to their knees and spin. David rides in the back of a cab, his eyes shifting to his window as the city's glimmering lights glide past. The taxi slows in front of Cedar Lake. Now David enters the dance studio. He joins a group of patrons who stand near a tiered section of stage. Elise sits on the top platform, her feet resting on a bench below it. As she hunches forward, a group of dancers gathered behind her lifts her into the air.",
    "977": "As he passed his door's room, the old man calls out to him. Grainy footage of him getting zapped. Benjamin stares at doors who looks around thoughtfully. Benjamin walks on up the corridor. He stops outside the door to his room and stands looking pensive. It's dark as Benjamin walks up outside Thomas's house and knocks on the door. A servant walks to the front door, pulling up his braces. The servant opens the door and directs Benjamin up the stairs. Benjamin opens the door of Thomas's room and goes inside. Thomas is asleep in bed. Benjamin gently shakes him. As the very first rays of dawn light creep across the sky, Thomas's car pulls up outside the country house. The chauffeur and Benjamin get out of the car. As Benjamin walks around the vehicle, the chauffeur helps Thomas out of the car. With the sky tinged orange, Benjamin wheels Thomas along in a wheelchair. They come to a halt. The chauffeur waits in the car and pulls his cap over his eyes. In front of the lake house, Benjamin lifts Thomas out of the wheelchair and carries him over his shoulders down to a jetty which leads out into the waters of the vast lake. He carefully sets Thomas down and lowers him onto a wooden seat. Benjamin pats Thomas on the shoulder and takes a seat behind his father. Thomas sits looking out across the expanse of water towards the dawn on the far horizon. He nods to himself as he takes in the view. Thomas closes his eyes and sighs. He and Benjamin are silhouetted against the rising sun. An assortment of buttons is swept off a table into a jar. Thomas lies dead on a table. An undertaker places the jar of buttons on Thomas's stomach. Benjamin and an elderly Queenie visits him as he lies in an open casket in an ornate chapel at rest. He holds out his arm. She takes it. The exterior of the majestic theater on Broadway, a yellow cab pulls up outside the theater. Benjamin gets out clutching a bunch of flowers. He pays the cab driver and goes into the theater. Benjamin steps into the darkened auditorium. On stage, a woman in a headdress is lifted up by two men who exits stage right. Certain beautiful with a long platted ponytail, Daisy takes to the stage with her dance partner. Benjamin watches as the man raises her aloft like the thicker head of a ship against the painted backdrop of a stormy ocean. Benjamin, no longer wearing spectacles, takes a seat and stares fixedly at them as the dancer turns gracefully with Daisy reclining in his arms. The spotlights shift to follow their movements as they pranced left and right.",
    "980": "He stares at her for a moment then lets go of the screen door and purposefully walks across the porch to embrace her. She flings her arms around him with a big smile. They sit indoors. She leaves. Daisy leans across the dining table. Benjamin carries two of Daisy's suitcases as they walk side by side through the silent shadowy corridors of the home. They enter a bedroom decorated with framed landscape paintings. Daisy puts her coat and hand back down on the double bed which has tall elaborately-carved bedposts. She closes the door and turns around. Their eyes meet across the dimly-lit room. Stepped closer and Benjamin firmly clasps her torso. Daisy arches her back slightly as their lips meet in a slow kiss. Benjamin unfastens her belt then unzips the back of her dress. She carefully rolls down her stocking, revealing a scar beneath her right knee. He slides off her dress and kisses the back of her neck. Her hand meets his as he grasps her right thigh. She turns to kiss him. Her long sleek red hair draped over one shoulder. Benjamin pulls his sweater off and climbs onto the bed as Daisy reclines, wearing a sultry black slip. A clock ticked from Queenie's old dresser. Benjamin and Daisy are silhouetted against the lilac sunset on the slowly drifting boat, the Bottomup. Benjamin looks up to see a space rocket rise over billowing mountainous clouds on the horizon. Daisy wrings out her wet hair. Benjamin playfully engulfs her in a stripy towel. They lounged together beneath palm trees on golden sands. Standing beside her on the ocean, Benjamin watches Daisy as she raises her head from the still waters. Night, they make love on the deck. They dive off the prowl of the boat as moonlight plays on the glittering surface of the sea. They swim gracefully beneath a brilliant full moon. They remained seated at the picnic branch as people flee from an advancing storm. They lie on the floor close to bed. He lies face down with his eyes closed. Daisy rests her chin against his shoulder. Lightning flashes. The wind rattles the windows. The doors rattle in the gale. Pale diaphanous drapes and close them in their bed. Daisy rolls onto her side and smiles as she gazes at him. He props himself up and looks at her. She strokes his cheek. He smiles. He inches closer. They kiss. A ceiling fan turns beneath the slipping raft over their bed. In the hospital, Caroline stares down at the diary. Looking tanned and healthy, Benjamin and Daisy carry luggage up the front steps of the retirement home. Benjamin enters ahead of Daisy to find it deserted.",
    "983": "Now a toddler, Caroline sleeps beside Daisy. Watched by Benjamin, Daisy wakes. They sit with Caroline in a park. Daisy stares at him. Chubby-cheeked Caroline plays with a toy caterpillar. Balloons decorate the dining room of their duplex. Parents sit at the table with their children. Benjamin goes to the kitchen. Benjamin looks back into the dining room, where Daisy sits with little Caroline on her knee. A decorative figure of a little girl adorns the remains of a pretty, white birthday cake. The guests have departed. Daisy washes up in the kitchen. She watches Benjamin through a Venetian blind. He sits on a wall outside, with Caroline in his lap. Caroline lets go of a yellow helium balloon. It floats away into the sky. Daisy smiles. Benjamin watches Caroline sleeping in her cot. He takes a bulging envelope from the old dresser drawer and a savings book from a small box. He puts them on top of the dresser with a house key. Daisy lies in bed, watching him. He meets her gaze. They share a long look. Benjamin retreats into the shadows and leaves the room. Daisy sits up in bed as he heads for the front door. Daisy throws back the bed covers. Zipping up his jacket, Benjamin goes to his motorcycle in the cold, blue light of dawn. Daisy sits on the edge of the bed as Benjamin rides his motorcycle down the driveway, to the road. She stands at her window, watching, as he rides away. Caroline sits in the corner. She turns a page of the diary to find a number of postcards bound with an elastic band. She removes it and reads the back of one. Sallow-skinned Daisy watches from the bed as Caroline leafs through the postcards. Caroline flips another postcard over and reads it. Daisy listens. Daisy closes her eyes. Caroline unfolds a letter. He backpacks through India. Locals wash in a river. He wakes in a sleeping bag. He looks out over a beautiful, desolate landscape. He mends his motorbike. Now a young man, he carries groceries down a street. A dying Daisy frowns. 50-something Daisy crosses her dance studio. Little girls file through a windowed office as Daisy puts an arm into one sleeve of her coat. She switches off the studio lights as parents usher their children out of the building, then finishes putting her coat on as she starts across the darkened foyer. A figure stands by the door. The figure steps forward. His mid-length hair is a sun-kissed blond. His build is slighter and his skin smoother. He shrugs. Caroline's 12. Daisy hangs her head. They shake hands. A gray-haired man enters. Robert looks confused. He looks at Daisy, who's fighting back tears, then strokes Caroline's hair.",
    "984": "Robert and Caroline stroll through to the back as Daisy goes to the front doors. They gaze at each other. A smile plays on Benjamin's lips. Daisy frowns. She strides past him to the windowed office. She turns to him and closes the door. Benjamin follows Daisy through a bright corridor to the back entrance. Outside, they share a look. Daisy turns and strolls to Robert's beige SUV. Benjamin watches as she gets in. Her eyes remain fixed on Benjamin as Robert reverses onto the road. Benjamin stands beneath a concrete canopy studded with lights. He watches as the vehicle drives away. A strong wind buffets the hospital. Caroline returns to the diary. Benjamin opens his hotel room door to Daisy. She lowers her eyes as she steps over the threshold. Benjamin closes the door of room 325. They stand in profile, silhouetted against the low light of his hotel room. She nods. Daisy reaches out and gently strokes Benjamin's smooth cheek. He tenderly massages her left shoulder. He draws her closer, and they hold each other tightly. He looks her in the eye and gently slides her coat off her shoulders. A TV set. Wearing only a bra and knickers, Daisy stands with her back to Benjamin, who's propped up in bed. He watches as she pulls her black leotard on. She puts her coat on and turns to face him. He looks at her with an air of sadness as she strolls to his hotel room door. He leans on the windowsill as she walks to a taxi. Daisy gets into a yellow taxi outside her large, white house. The cab pulls away. Now in her late 60s, Daisy addresses the cab driver. The taxi approaches the stately, white-clapboard edifice of the retirement home. An elderly black man sits at a table in the courtyard, sketching. Wrapped in a shawl, Daisy ambles up nearby. She smiles weakly as she looks around. Daisy enters the building via the back door. Queenie's daughter beckons Daisy into the room. A bearded man with name tag rises. He gives her the diary. Daisy looks down, then turns on hearing a piano. She walks into the communal living area, where a figure is hunched over the keyboard of the piano. David and Queenie's daughter hover as Daisy approaches the figure. He turns and stares vacantly. He's a child of about 12. She reaches out, but Benjamin recoils. He turns and looks at her. He has cropped, sandy hair and acne. Daisy blinks and takes a slow, inward breath. She takes a seat beside him, and he narrows his eyes. She shakes her head. She was drying his hair with a towel. Little Benjamin stands on the high, gray-slate rooftop.",
    "987": "Frowning, Benjamin plants his hands on the armrests of his chair and labors determinedly to stand up. He adjusts his leg with his hands. Benjamin stands, then collapses. The preacher points both hands at Benjamin. Benjamin struggles to his feet and stands shakily before the congregation. His posture's crooked. He takes a step. The congregation clap and cheer him on. The preacher freezes with his arms held aloft. Two concerned men rise sharply, and the preacher keels over. A white-robed pianist starts to play. The flag outside flies at half-mast. Music plays from a gramophone beside a grave. Benjamin, Queenie, and Tizzy are amongst the mourners. As the song ends, a man claps two cymbals together. An old guy. Benjamin eavesdrops on a conversation. Benjamin hobbles on crutches to the back door to watch Mr. Oti holding court in the garden. He turns to see Benjamin, who ducks out of sight. Indoors, diminutive, sharp-suited Mr. Oti takes a seat beside Benjamin. Benjamin turns gingerly to meet his gaze. The black African, Mr. Oti, smiles. Outside, on the sunny street, Mr. Oti tips his hat to one of three children playing baseball. Wearing a large, ill-fitting fedora, Benjamin struggles to keep up with him on crutches. Mr. Oti waves to a tram. On board, Bushman shares cage with apes. He bares his teeth at three children in the whites-only section of the tram. They cower. They sit on a bench by tall stone columns. Benjamin presses his lips together and looks away, thoughtfully. Benjamin smiles at Mr. Oti, then looks away again. Benjamin sips root beer. They approach a woman in town. Oti hugs her. Dwarfed by Philomena, Mr. Oti walks away. Alone, Benjamin fails to reach a tram in time. He waves a crutch in the air as the tram glides off. Benjamin cuts a forlorn figure as he plods away. Night, Benjamin determinedly makes his way down a sidewalk. As he arrives at the familiar clapboard retirement home, Queenie lifts a sash window and stares down at him. At a basin. She goes and he stares at his wet, blistered hands. On the lawn, Benjamin turns to see a man watching him from the street. The man, his father, Thomas, gets into the back of a car. An elegant, gray-haired woman. The girl pirouettes. Benjamin sits with Oti, Philomena, Miss Fuller, and Daisy. Queenie takes Tizzy's hand. Miss Fuller reads to Daisy from an illustrated storybook. Benjamin sits with them. Night, age six, with long red hair, Daisy approaches Benjamin's bed. He sits up. She beckons him. Benjamin hobbles down a flight of stairs in the dark. Table linen has been thrown over some tables and chairs to form a tent.",
    "988": "Daisy crawls into the makeshift den, and Benjamin follows on his hands and knees. Kneeling beneath the table, Benjamin strikes a match and carefully lights a candle, whose warm glow silhouettes them behind the white drapery. Daisy smiles. She gingerly reaches out to touch his smiling face. Benjamin holds her gaze as she touches his stubbly cheek. Miss Fuller whisks up the sheet, exposing them. Daisy obeys. Miss Fuller scowls at Benjamin. Wearing a nightgown, she starts up the stairs, using her cane. Dejected, Benjamin leans out of the den with his head hung. Queenie comes up from the basement in her dressing gown and catches sight of him kneeling in the shadows, staring at the floor. Suddenly resolute, Benjamin rises, resting on his cane. She embraces him. She gently strokes his back and kisses him on the forehead. She scratches her head thoughtfully as he walks away. Benjamin hooks his cane on the end of his bed and gets in. Old man Daws. He's in the bed opposite. Grainy old footage of the lightning striking him. Sepia footage of Mr. Daws collapsing by a mailbox. Lying in his bed, Daws exhales a cloud of wispy, white cigarette smoke and stares off in thought. Benjamin turns onto his side and sinks down beneath the covers. Smiling, Oti takes a step back, then turns and walks briskly out of the door. Straight-backed and without the use of a cane, Benjamin goes to a window and peers out through narrowed eyes. Carrying a suitcase, Oti crosses the road below, bathed in the orange glow of a streetlamp. A woman with a dog. He sits beside her at a piano. He joins in. They play together. Benjamin washes himself in the bath. He stares down. Caroline leaves Daisy's bedside. On TV, Hurricane Katrina. A nurse arrives. They stand by a window at the foot of the bed. The nurse strides off to assist a colleague, and Caroline drifts over to the empty bed beside her mother's. Cast in cold, blue light from the window, she takes her hands out of the pockets of her dark body-warmer and sits cross-legged on the mattress with the diary in her lap. Mr. Daws sits beside him on a bench. Grainy footage. Lightning strikes Mr. Daws in a field, sending up a plume of smoke. A man approaches them on the dock. The captain glances around. Benjamin looks at a young guy. Benjamin stands up. The bearded captain wears braces and a peaked cap. He nods. Benjamin boards the tugboat Chelsea. The captain leans out of the wheelhouse. He swabs the decks. In the wheelhouse, Mike leans towards Benjamin. Mike squints thoughtfully. Benjamin wears a searching expression.",
    "990": "At the graveside, Benjamin turns to Mrs. Maple's dog. Daisy watches as he says his goodbyes. Tizzy shakes hands with Benjamin. Queenie hugs him. Red-haired Daisy watches as he heads off. Carrying a kit bag and a suitcase, Benjamin, who now looks in his late 60s, walks along the sidewalk. He gets to the end of the road. He stops and sees Daisy running after him. She turns and runs back down the street. Benjamin carries on up the road. In the hospital, Caroline opens a box full of old postcards tied up with ribbon. Daisy does a pirouette. Captain Mike and Benjamin are on the snow-covered deck. Mike points to a tattoo on his chest. He makes a figure of eight with his hand. The twins start to fight. In an elevator, Benjamin now looks in his 50s. To Benjamin, as he follows them out of the lift. Back on the snow-covered deck of the tugboat, the tug is towing a gigantic ship. Benjamin lies in bed in the hotel. He's found Elizabeth in the lobby of the hotel. She's sitting on a sofa, a dressing gown over her nightdress, reading. Benjamin is in his dressing gown. He heads towards the kitchen, then turns back to her. Benjamin goes through to the kitchen. Elizabeth stares after him. She closes the magazine she was reading and gets to her feet. She peers into the kitchen, where Benjamin is busy making the tea. She walks into the kitchen and Benjamin looks up. Elizabeth opens her mouth, as if about to say something. Benjamin goes over to her worktop and picks up two Russian tea glasses and their holders. He puts the fly-ridden honey pot down and carries the tea glasses and the teapot over to a table. Elizabeth takes a seat as Benjamin pours the tea. Benjamin sits down, and they eye each other across the table. Elizabeth wags her forefinger. Benjamin checks on the teapot. Elizabeth looks a little awkward as he pours her a cup. She sips her tea. She looks thoughtful. They share a smile and sip their tea. They both smile. Heavy snow falls over the tugboat. Benjamin comes downstairs. Elizabeth gets up to greet him. Mr. Oti, Queenie, Tizzy, and Daisy sleep soundly. Elizabeth turns to Benjamin. She looks a little flustered and heads off. In the hospital. At the ballet school, young Daisy reads Benjamin's card. Looking sad, she dances with other students in front of a panel of judges. At night in the hotel, Benjamin comes downstairs into the lobby and finds Elizabeth wearing an evening dress. They sit at a table in the hotel dining room. Benjamin tentatively tries a spoonful of caviar.",
    "991": "They sip their vodkas. Elizabeth takes another spoonful of caviar. They each take another swig of vodka. A reporter interviews her on the beach. Benjamin takes her hand, and she responds. He stares at her through his round spectacles. She looks up at him and touches his face. She smiles. They lean together and share a kiss. She gets up from the table and walks away. Wearing a suit, Benjamin takes the lift down to the hotel lobby. Outside, they open champagne. They walk through the deserted, snowy streets. They walk arm in arm, the streetlights dimly illuminating their way. Benjamin shivers. In the hotel, Benjamin takes a room key off a hook behind reception. He gets in the lift with Elizabeth and closes the doors. The lift rises. Elizabeth wears a fur coat and a hat with a broad brim, which casts her face in shadow. They gaze at each other. They arrive outside room 57, and he unlocks the door. He holds it open and turns to Elizabeth. She falls into his arms, and they disappear into the room. Caroline smiles and keeps reading. Returning from work, Benjamin gets in the lift at the hotel. Elizabeth's po-faced husband is the only other occupant. Benjamin avoids his gaze as the lift rises. Evening, he and Elizabeth go to room 57. Elizabeth kisses him twice as they leave the room. She starts to walk away down the corridor. She looks back. She smiles and goes. He comes downstairs and finds the lobby deserted. He finds the dining room and the kitchen deserted, too. He looks over at the bar, then takes a seat by the fire in the lobby. As the night wears on, Benjamin drifts off to sleep. When he wakes, people are milling around the lobby. Looking awkward, Mr. Mayes heads out of the bar, past Benjamin. Captain Mike swigs from a coffee cup. Benjamin unlocks his door and finds a note has been pushed under it. Night, on board the tugboat. Benjamin, who'd just thrown a bucket of water over the side of the ship, goes below decks. Benjamin lies on his bed, reading a magazine. One of the other sailors, Pleasant, calls down from his top bunk. He hands Benjamin a big roll of notes. Pleasant lies back out of Benjamin's sight. Up on deck, Benjamin and the other crew members walk towards the prow of the tug, passing Mike, who's ringing the alarm bell. They look out into the night. Up ahead of them, they see several burning ships on the dark horizon. Pleasant runs up to a search light mounted by the wheel house. Dead bodies drift in the dark waters. In the wheelhouse, the wheelman kills the engines.",
    "992": "The tug drifts. Somewhere ahead of them, a U-boat surfaces in the darkness. Pleasant bangs on the wheelhouse window. The tug restarts its engines, sending a plume of black smoke out of its funnel. Mike and Benjamin peer over the side and spot the U-boat upper head. A U-boat slides the whole surface. The tug's lights are visible on the horizon. Hurries into the wheelhouse. The wheelman stares at him. Mike hands the wheelman a pistol. A crew member mans a heavy machine gun on top of the tug. A gunner climbs into the conning tower. Benjamin has a life jacket. Benjamin gives the life jacket to one of the twins. Lights are turned off on the tug, and Vic makes the sign of the cross. Manning the heavy machine gun, Danny Smith cocks the weapon. The wheelman aims his pistol at the U-boat. Captain Mike grits his teeth, then sets the engines full ahead and steams towards the U-boat. The German gunner spots the tug approaching and opens fire with a machine gun. Benjamin ducks his face around. Dann burns fire. Mike flinches as the German rounds shatter the windows. Manning the searchlight, Pleasant catches a bullet and collapses. Benjamin cowers on the deck below the wheelhouse. Danny Smith's hit and falls from the machine gun. Mike also takes a hit and collapses. Vic crosses himself again as tugboat plows forward and smashes into the side of the U-boat. The U-boat explodes beneath the tug. Both vessels take on water and begin to sink. Benjamin staggers into the wheelhouse. In the darkness, he finds Mike on the floor. He props him up, and Mike screams in pain. Mike tears his jumper, revealing two bullet holes in his chest. Benjamin takes the captain's blood-soaked hand in his. Mike dies. Benjamin stares down at him. Benjamin, his face stained with blood, stares at his lifeless skipper. Vic cradles his dead twin. A door swings open on the tug which is listing badly in the water. As the dawn breaks, the tug and the U-boat have sunk below the waves. A fleet of other ships are now at the scene. Watched by a grieving Vic, Benjamin tosses a life belt from The Chelsea over the side of the rescue vessel. As it floats in the water, a hummingbird flies past it. The bird flies up and hovers briefly in front of Benjamin, then flies off. The sun shines down out of a clear, blue sky. Benjamin, who now looks about 50, with shorter hair and new specs, wanders into the retirement home. She looks around and sees him. She takes a few seconds to recognize him. He looks down. Benjamin plays the piano.",
    "993": "At night, a green light pulses through a mist at the edge of a body of water. Snowflakes drift through the dark sky. Beyond is a stately Victorian building. The narrator, Nick Carraway, is with a doctor. The doctor sits, listening. Nick sits with his head resting on his hands. Nick goes to a window. He paces around the room. Nick's handsome face is set in a haggard, weary frown. The streets of New York are crowded with people. Frantic traders on Wall Street. Money piles up. Dancing girls. Illicit booze is bottled. A red biplane does a corkscrew dive above a skyscraper. A younger, fresh-faced Nick looks up from the busy street, smiling. At work, Nick is on the phone. A girl beckons from the beach. A spectacular mansion with an ornate garden. Men play polo on the lawn. In his trophy room, Tom hurls a football at Nick and charges at him, barging him through double doors. Nick looks around and finds himself in a large salon with several pairs of doors open. Long white drapes billow across the room in the breeze. An ornate crystal chandelier hangs from the ceiling. A young woman cavorts on a couch. The servants close the doors. The beautiful blonde-haired young woman rises on the couch. She pulls him over the couch. Another young woman, a brunette, sits with her. Nick turns to Daisy. Tom glowers at her. The butler, Henri, gestures towards the doors. They're all opened by servants. The drapes billow into the room. Later, dinner is served at a long table on the terrace. At the sound of a telephone, Daisy's smile fades. Her eyes dart nervously. Handsome, debonair Tom goes into the salon. Daisy goes after him. Nick smiles at Jordan. Henri opens the doors. Daisy and Tom return. Daisy closes her eyes despairingly. They stop by rose bushes. She glances round at Tom, watching from the open doors of the salon. She looks tearful. She gazes wistfully into the distance, beyond the lavish gardens, past the green beacon and across the Bay of Consequence, towards West Egg and Gatsby's mansion. In the dark, a man walks towards the end of a long, narrow, raised dock which juts out into the bay. Nick drives along a tree-lined lane. He parks his car in front of his cottage and gets out. He looks over at the dock. Nick walks closer. The suited man stands at the end of the dock by railings. Nick watches the man slowly raise his right hand. Way off in the distance, across the water, the bright, green beacon pulses. In the sanitarium, Nick stands at the window, tapping the frosted glass. Outside, snow continues to fall.",
    "1001": "A secret door opens. They walk through the sliding door which has the barber's price list on it. Wolfsheim leads Gatsby and Nick into a busy speakeasy with arched ceilings. Girls in tasseled bikinis and feather headdresses dance on a stage. A line of barmen flamboyantly makes cocktails. A cop throws a man out. Gatsby walks through, shaking hands with people. Wolfsheim, Nick and Gatsby sit at a table facing the dancers. Gatsby and Wolfsheim study Nick who sits between them looking slightly bewildered but smiling politely. Gatsby and Wolfsheim exchange pointed looks and Gatsby goes. He leans closer. Wolfsheim's tie pin is a jeweled tooth. They look up at Gatsby. Wolfsheim swaggers away. Unnerved, Gatsby paints on a smile. Nick looks around. The city's aglow with neon lights. Nick goes to meet Jordan at a rooftop restaurant. Nick frowns. In a flashback, Jordan practices golf on Daisy's lawn. In battle, Gatsby leads a charge. Nick and Jordan walk arm-in-arm along a busy city street. They get a cab. Nick and Jordan ride in the cab. A bright moon hangs in the night sky. The cab drives along the tree-lined lane. Gatsby stands amongst the trees near Nick's cottage, looking up the lane. Nick sees Gatsby and frowns. The cab rolls up and Nick gets out. The cab drives off. Gatsby stands bathed in light. Nick looks over at Gatsby and gestures towards the mansion. They both smile, slightly awkwardly, and look down. Gatsby gives a sharp nod and turns to go. Gatsby turns back. Gatsby looks around edgily. Nick smiles openly. Gatsby nods and looks slightly at a loss. Gatsby turns and walks away. Nick looks curious. A bright sunny morning. A stone birdbath is cleaned up and surrounded with pretty flowers. Nick comes out of his cottage, in his dressing gown, to find Gatsby's gardeners at work sprucing up the garden. A path of paving slabs is laid. Hedges are trimmed. Flowers are arranged in beds. Nick looks up at a man trimming a rose arch and steps under it. Nick reaches out his hand. It's pouring with rain. Wearing a white suit, Gatsby walks up with a line of staff all holding up umbrellas. Now dressed, Nick watches from a window. The staff members carry flower arrangements. One of them has a very fancy four-tiered pink cake. Nick has a tray of little cupcakes. Gatsby steps up. The staff go into the cottage. The flowers are carried into the cottage. Gatsby looks tense. Gatsby frowns and goes inside, leaving Nick holding his tray of little cakes. A clock on the mantelpiece reads a few minutes to four. Nick sits, dwarfed by extravagant flower arrangements. There's a cake stand full of cakes and a big pile of brightly colored macaroons.",
    "1003": "He nods to Nick and takes a deep breath. Gatsby sneaks furtively into the kitchen area and peers through the flowers into the room. Watching from the door, Nick takes off his boater and gestures for Gatsby to tidy his hair. He smooths it back with his hand. Finally, appearing confident and relaxed and with the old familiar glint in his eyes, Gatsby steps towards the room. Nick stands beneath a tree in the rain. Drenched, he returns and sees Gatsby and Daisy deep in conversation. He rattles a bowl in the sink to make his presence known. Daisy and Gatsby don't notice and continue looking deep into each other's eyes, smiling at each other. Nick gives up, walks in and takes off his coat. Gatsby glances at the window then returns his unwavering gaze to Daisy. Her dark eyes return his gaze adoringly. Gatsby smiles, gets up and opens the French windows. A bright blue sky peeps through the diminishing rainclouds. Sunlight glimmers on the calm bay. They step out onto the porch. They rest against a pillar and their fingers touch. They look at each other. He points across the bay. Gatsby walks back inside. They walk up the drive. Daisy looks up in wonder. Surrounded by gushing fountains and ornamental palms, they look up at the house. Gatsby looks at Daisy, framed by the fountain. It's an orange-squeezing machine. Daisy, Gatsby and Nick swim on his private beach. Gatsby dives from a diving pontoon out in the water. Nick films Daisy hitting a golf ball. They tumble into the ballroom. Daisy marvels at the monumental organ. Gatsby takes Daisy and Nick on a tour. He throws shirts from a balcony. Daisy flops onto the pile of brightly colored shirts on the bed. Nick looks down from the balcony in the opulent bedroom. Noticing the change in Daisy's mood, Gatsby goes down to the bed where she sits. Gatsby strokes her chin and she looks up at Nick. Nick walks away somberly. Gatsby kisses her brow. Nick walks down a spiral staircase. He looks at a wall and a desk where pictures and trophies are displayed. A photograph of a distinguished old man. Gatsby sits on his bed, holding Daisy close to him. Daisy rests her head in Gatsby's lap and follows his gaze to the window and beyond. Nick walks over. He takes a book from a shelf. He opens the book. Touched, Daisy runs her fingers over them. Gatsby goes to the other side of the room to answer the phone. He turns his back to Nick and Daisy. Outside, a strong swelling breeze whips up on the balcony. The French windows are blown open. Nick closes them and listens to Gatsby.",
    "1005": "Gatsby stops and turns back. Nick smiles. Gatsby walks between stone pillars off into the dark grounds. Gatsby walks amongst the dark trees which are dotted with fireflies and finds Daisy standing by a tree near Nick's cottage. Gatsby, in a dark dinner suit and bow tie, slowly approaches her. They gaze into each other's eyes. He cups his hand against her cheek, leans closer and kisses her passionately on the lips. He wraps his arm around her waist, pulls her close and kisses her neck. Her eyes closed, Daisy tilts her head back, enraptured. Drink in hand, Nick stands on the terrace looking out into the darkness. Looking slightly disheveled, Tom walks up behind him. Nick turns to Tom and frowns. Tom smooths his hair back and turns to the barman. Gatsby continues to cover Daisy in kisses. Gatsby pauses and lifts his head with a slight smile. He meets Daisy's gaze. Nick points his cottage out to Tom. Tom looks towards the cottage. Gatsby touches Daisy's face. Gatsby steps away from Daisy. Slagle and his associates are fighting with the staff. Tom puts down his glass. Nick lifts his glass. Daisy turns to see Nick walk through the trees. Gatsby goes to Herzog. Daisy watches pensively as Gatsby goes with Herzog. The party winds down. Wolfsheim paces in front of Gatsby in his study. Tom and Daisy are driven away from the mansion. Gatsby watches from a window. They're driven away. Standing at the window, Gatsby looks thoughtful. Four of Gatsby's men march Slagle out through the gates. One of them lays into Slagle with heavy punches to the face. Inside, the staff clear up. As his staff busy themselves clearing up the mess, Gatsby stands on the terrace looking out across the bay. The green light on the dock at Tom Buchanan's mansion gently pulses. Nick comes down some steps. He tosses a bottle in the pool. Gatsby grabs his suit jacket. Gatsby clenches his eyes shut and pinches the bridge of his nose. In the flashback, Gatsby follows Daisy to an upstairs room. They stand close to each other about to kiss, then Gatsby moves back. A shooting star flies across the night sky. They stand transfixed by each other. Gatsby leans closer and kisses Daisy. They sink into a passionate embrace. They lie together. He kisses her soft white skin and they lie in each other's arms. Daisy's grand house stands alone lit up at night. The light fades. He points up and a star shoots by. He tosses something into the illuminated pool. They both smile wistfully. Gatsby looks across the dark bay. Gatsby smiles confidently and steps over to Nick, who looks down, frowning.",

He puts on a black jacket, as he walks. Robin rushes up some stair with a dark-haired woman close behind. Robin stops outside a door while the woman walks up to it. The Queen looks up from her bed. The Queen switches on a bedside lamp. And Prince Phillip sits up beside her. The Queen exits the bedroom and Robin bows. He turns to Cherie in bed. Charles enters the room. The Queen Mother and Phillip and The Queen are present. Charles turns and leaves the room. Robin approaches a blonde woman. Robin picks up a phone from a nearby desk. Later, Robin later slowly ascends some stairs. The royal family are still watching the television. Robin enters the room, but stays by the door. Charles stands in a dark room with Steven. Charles rubs his brow and Steven backs away. BBC video news footage plays. Tony stares at a nearby TV. On the other end of the phone, Alistair Campbell scribbles on a note pad. The Queen walks down a dimly lit corridor. Peeking through a doorway, the Queen sees Charles talking to Prince William and Prince Harry. Charles sees her and leaves the room. Charles moves to reenter the room. The Queen extends her hand briefly, then, retracts it. Charles stops. Charles' eyes wells with tears. The Queen casts her eyes downward. The Queen walks down a corridor and addresses a footman. Later, the Queen sits at a desk and writes in a book. Phillip enters a room and stands by the door. Prince Phillip holds out a small bottle of pills. Prince Phillip leaves the room. People are gathering with shocked and anguished expressions on their faces. Some bury their faces into their hands.",

Monday, video footage shows a long line of people standing outside Buckingham Palace, laying more flowers at the gates. Bunches of flowers pile up at the railings. A massive people were held back by metal barriers. One woman crouches by the gates, holding a hand to her face. Inside a large room, dignitaries and their advisers sit around a long table. Outside 10 Downing Street, a car stops and Allister emerges from a backseat door, carrying some papers. After seeing the newspapers, Tony moves to leave. Two men, holding rifles, exit Balmoral followed by Charles, William, and Harry. Some Land Rovers are parked in the courtyard. The Queen watches from a window above. The Queen opens a newspaper. Robin enters holding a tray of items. The Queen looks out of the window and clinches her jaw. Robin casts his eyes down. The Queen sits down in a nearby armchair. Robin leaves a notepad on the table close by. Later, Tony sits at a desk with a female assistant beside him. A nervous Charles looks up at Steven. While, at the other end, a befuddled Tony puts down the phone. The Queen walks with two black Labradors. The Queen opens the door to old Land Rover and gets the dogs inside. Charles settles into the passenger seat. The Queen and Charles drive along a country road. The Queen gets out, opens the back door. And the three black Labradors jump out. Charles moves round to the driver's side. Charles drives away leaving the Queen with the dogs. Figures can be glimpsed on the green hills nearby. One of them looks through some binoculars. Three more stand still while another three lie on the ground. In the distance, over the next hill, a stag stands alone. Later, the Queen sits on a bed and watches footage from an interview with Diana on TV. Philip standing in the doorway. The Queen stares thoughtfully at the TV. The Queen twists a silver pen in her hands. The Queen gazes at prince Philip for a moment and then turns away. The Queen sips some drink from a glass. A distracted Queen nods faintly.

    "1019": "Now, a shower with steamy glass doors blur our view of a couple having sex. As the woman gets out, her partner follows. A title appears with an arrow pointing at the woman's face. Now, the man opens the door and finds an adolescent girl with a massive golden-brown curl sleeping face-down in bed. In a t-shirt and boxers, the man lumbers over to the bed and lightly touches her arm. As she lies unresponsive, he barrages her with lazy slaps. She reaches a hand out. He kisses her cheek. Later, he lies close to a little blonde girl and kisses her cheek. He carries her down the hall. Now, the older girl makes bacon and scrambled eggs as her father brings in big, colorful balloons. He sneaks some bacon, drinks OJ from the plastic jug and eats a cupcake. His youngest sets off a confetti shooter. Another room, the wife and mother sits at a window with a towel over her hair. She smokes a cigarette with a latex-gloved hand. Meanwhile, her family hangs streamers, sets out presents and puts candles shaped like the number 38 on a cake.

A car darts out and nearly hits them. Now, his wife does crunches. The plump woman bounces on a stability ball. Barb's features pinch up. He affects a lonely, pitiful gaze. In a coffeehouse.

He rides past a white picket fence. A car door swings open. A husky man looks down at him. Debbie drives by. He punches Pete in the face. The man easily absorbs Pete's stomach punch, then knocks Pete over with one. Debbie gets out and runs to Pete. The man gets in his SUV as Pete writhes in glass. The man pulls away. Pete sees the dealer license plate. He puts his head down as Debbie arrives. Now, in a hospital hallway, Debbie shakes her head as she sits with Larry. A nurse approaches. The nurse steps away.

Ryan looks at her and sighs. She looks blank. At a luggage store, Ryan wheels a wheelie case back and forth. Natalie kneels on the floor, transferring her belongings from her hefty suitcase to the neater, smaller wheelie case. Ryan grabs a travel pillow. He bins it. He bins a full-size pillow. At security, Ryan sees a group of businessmen. Ryan collects his things on the other side of the X-ray machine. Natalie is being scanned. Natalie takes off a bracelet. On the plane, she and Ryan sit side-by-side with the aisle between them. Natalie types on her laptop. He looks across at her. She stares at him. With a dismissive glance, she gets back to work. Ryan smiles wryly. St. Louis. As they walk through the terminal building, Ryan gets a call from Alex. A smile spreads across Ryan's face. Ryan walks through an open-plan office with Natalie, who's clutching a pile of strategy packets. Office workers stare at them as they head to a private office. Natalie silently seethes. An older balding man holds up a photo of two young girls. Sitting opposite him, Ryan glances down. Natalie is beside Ryan. Ryan is incredulous. Bob sits back resigned. Bob shakes his head. Natalie studies Ryan. Craggy-faced Bob stares at Ryan thoughtfully. He glances down at the photos of his girls. Ryan nods to Natalie, who picks up one of the strategy packets and hands it to Bob.

In the dining room, Ryan sits with three plates of food. Natalie sits. Natalie pokes at her plate of food with her fork. Ryan throws out his hand and smiles.",
    "1037": "A bright white light shines in front of a cloudy sky. The light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long white robe with a blue sash draped around her. Silver metallic letters appear on a black background. Framed within a V shape, a city skyline is visible. A motorcade sweeps through the city streets, with motorcycles in the background. Men in suits climb stairs. The motorcade moves past a tall stone bell tower towards the flashing lights of a parked police car. A GNN TV camera is fixed on the vehicles. The convoy comes to a halt. Cameras flash. The President, a tall man with a receding hairline, emerges. He and his guards move away from the car. One of the Secret Service agents is visible. Barnes, a man in his 50s with a furrowed brow, glances all around, scanning rooftops and the protesters as he walks ahead of the President. On a preview monitor, the GNN gallery crew watch footage of an assassination attempt on President Ashton. Barnes takes the bullets for the President. The President's hustled to safety. The President recoils. A bomb goes off in the plaza. Smoke erupts from the explosion and blanks out the TV cameras. The plaza is covered in its dense blanket. The gallery is stunned. As the smoke clears, the director catches sight of Angie lying on the ground. Angie has blood on her forehead and chest as she lies amongst the rubble. The picture constantly breaks up. The director and her assistant fight back tears. The director, 40-something Rex Brooks, gets to her feet and switches off the feed. Her face haggard and weary, she sits back down by her younger, weeping PA. The events rewind. Pre-explosion. Angie reporting. The President at the lectern. The motorcade en route to the plaza. Agent Barnes, his torso bare, turns from his window. He nods to his colleague Ken Taylor, then turns back to gaze out of the window as he puts on a shirt. Barnes has a scar on his back. Barnes strolls across the room and sits down on his bed. He has his tie in his hand as he fastens his shirt. He reaches for a pill bottle. Popping the lid, he tips the bottle. Barnes puts his hand to his grimacing face. Footage of the previous year's assassination attempt is shown. In the black and white footage, Barnes falls to the ground. In the hotel room, Barnes places the pill back in the bottle which he places on the bedside cabinet. Barnes lifts his gun from the cabinet and checks its magazine. In a hotel corridor, Barnes puts on his jacket as he walks in front of a large window against which he is silhouetted.",
    "1045": "Howard zooms back in vision. Barnes watches keenly. Barnes watches Veronica throw her bag under the podium. Barnes and Howard are thrown off their feet by the force of the explosion. Flames soar up from the podium. Black smoke filled the plaza. As the smoke subsides, Howard slowly sits up and rubs the back of his neck. The once heighered flags hanging limp and torn. Howard checks his hand for blood, then takes in the scene of devastation in front of him. He stretches out for his camera by his side, then sees Barnes with the injured Matthews. Howard pushes himself up onto his feet and looks around. He sees little Anna standing alone. She nods OK. He picks her up in his arms and runs out of the plaza with her. Outside, he hears Holden who's chasing Enrique. Anna nods. He sees Enrique making his escape. Holden and Parsons are in pursuit of Enrique. Howard still carrying Anna runs after them. He stops in front of a policewoman. Enrique keeps running. Holden and Parsons race after Enrique on the street outside the plaza. Howard heads after them, filming as he goes. Enrique dashes into a gated stone building. Holden and Parsons sprint after him. Howard charges through the tall gate where he comes to a halt inside a large church.

Howard videotapes a red sedan plowing into Enrique. Enrique staggers to his feet and runs. Parsons and Holden dart after him across the busy road. Howard dashes through the panicking crowd in hot pursuit. They race under colored canopies on a market street. Heavyset Howard stops to catch his breath. He gets Holden and Parsons on tape as they disappear around a corner. His eyes roam frantically and he darts down a parallel street. Beating down the side street as he runs, Howard sees Enrique make a B-line for a busy highway. Howard beams incredulously and gives chase with the camcorder held out in front of him. Enrique's pistol is holstered in his belt beside his police badge. A white sedan brakes sharply as he bounds out into the road. Howard stops by the roadside. He spots a pedestrian bridge over the highway. Enrique bolts out into oncoming traffic. Howard scampers up steel steps and hot foots it along the bridge. He stops and stares out some chain link mesh to see Enrique slow to a stop at an underpass. Howard cranes the camera on him. He sees Enrique's badge. A squad car drives up in front of Enrique, and a policeman approaches him.",

He lets go and strides off. Javier's eyes meet with Enrique's as they pass each other. Javier walks passed curly-haired Marie and pony-tailed Anna.

A bellboy answers a phone in the hotel reception. Felipe the bellboy hangs up the phone. The motorcade enters the underground parking lot. Javier answers his mobile. Javier takes the phone from his ear, then gasps as he approaches the hotel. Sam punches buttons on his phone and talks into the mic of his hands-free kit.

He points at Javier's pocket, and Javier takes out a cell phone. Felipe opens the door for a woman entering the hotel. Javier approaches. Then shakes Javier's hand, placing a small envelope into it. Javier enters the lobby, which is filled with Secret Service agents. Javier talks into his cell phone as he passes the suited agents. Javier lowers his phone and calls an elevator.

She settles down on a large tree stump. Lizzy folds up the letter and walks off. Mariah follows her inside and up the stairs. But, Lizzie hurries to her room and shuts the door behind her. Inside, she sits down near a window and opens up the letter again. Lizzie cringes as she remembers her family's improper behavior. Then she looks down at the letter once more. Darcy watches from above as Jane heads out dressed in a grey cloak and bonnet. Lizzie is now walking with Mr. Collins. Mr. Collins goes to bid his farewells to Lizzie. He looks over at his wife and gives her a little wave. She and Lizzie exchange a knowing smile. The horse-drawn carriage pulls away from the parsemage, gathering speed along the country road. Lizzie and Mariah are sitting inside. Mariah has a notebook open. Lizzie leans forward in her seat, looking thoughtful. As she stares out of the window, memories of Darcy pass through her mind. Platter of horses' hooves snaps at the rubbery. Finally, carriage pulls up outside a busy inn. Lydia opens one of the upper windows excitedly. Lizzie waves up at her and Kitty. Lydia indicates that she'll come down and meet them then closes the window. She embraces her sister warmly then sits back on the bed. He leaves the room.

The horses are being harnessed to the carriage outside. Mrs. Gardiner and Lizzie emerge, dressed in their outdoor clothes. Lizzie turns to him. She climbs into the carriage. At Pemberley, Mr. Darcy is sitting in the drawing room, watching Georgiana practice her piano playing. The Hursts, Mr. Bingley, and Miss Bingley are also present. Miss Bingley stands up. With a look of utter contempt, Mr. Darcy leaves the room. The two sisters exchange glances. At Longbourn, the Gardiners' four children are playing on the lawn when the carriage pulls into the driveway. They quickly hurry over to greet it.

He holds her hand as she walks along high wall. David boxes Jenny into position for a photo of her with Notre Dame Cathedral in the background. She poses. The guy on a bicycle checks her out as he rides past. David's less than impressed, then takes another photo. They run up steep stones steps then walk arm in arm. They join another couples slow dancing in the sunshine to a record playing on a small portable turntable. They lie cheek to cheek. They drink wine with a picnic by the river of dusk.

He walks towards Magarri and the horses, as her eyes fill with tears. She whirls round and goes back indoors, as he rides away. Nullah's dog attacks a cop whose chasing him. He turns slowly and looks into the eyes of a half-naked black tracker. Callahan finds Fletcher at the movies. King George is flung into cell, as Nullah is dragged away. Sarah drives through crowds on the wharf. Troopships crowd Darwin harbor. Nullah is with a group of half-caste children being shipped out. His grandfather hears in his cell. Sarah drives past lines of marching troops. Nullah stares at the white boy. Troops and civilians swarm towards the wharf. Sarah stops at a barrier and gets out of the car. Callahan drags the white boy away, as a priest pulls Nullah. Crocodile boots stop in front of him and Nullah looks up into Fletcher's face. Sarah barges her way anxiously through the crowd on the wharf. Smoke rises from ships' funnels. The priest leads him to a waiting boat. Fletcher observes, slyly. She runs down the wharf, as Nullah runs to the stern of the boat. The small boat pulls out of the shadow of the huge liners evacuating the town. The boy looks up at Sarah. Fletcher grins. Nullah waves to Sarah, who stops at the end of the wharf. Fletcher leans on the railing next to her, as the boat sails away. He turns smugly to her. He grins and saunters off. On the back of the boat, Nullah turns and looks up at a priest. Sarah leans on the wharf rail in despair, trying to control her sobs. The children's boat sails away from the wharf between huge, grey navy vessels. A Japanese fighter skims through the clouds towards an island. Sarah steps out onto the balcony and looks out over the harbor. He looks across at Drover, who's standing thoughtfully by a tree. As he whistles, Magarri stares at Drover, who looks uncomfortable and tentatively lays his hand on the tree. Magarri turns away and tears fill the Drover's eyes. Their vehicles raise a cloud of dust on the other side of the river they are camping next to. Clouds fill the sky. Fighters take off at dawn from an aircraft carrier. Mission Island sits peacefully in the grey sea, beneath the cloudy sky. The children are asleep in their dormitory. Nullah wakes up with a start. Smiling unpleasantly, Fletcher hangs up the phone in his office overlooking the whole of Darwin.",

The flickering flames illuminate the calm figure of King George, as others mill around trying to help. Drover walks through the town. King George shadows him. He looks out across the bay at the broken, burning hulks of ships. He walks towards the shattered pub. Some people are trying to patch it up. Others sit around staring or drinking vacantly. He approaches Ivan, who's sweeping up in the bar. Magarri follows him. Drover looks around, taking in the white drinkers and his nervous black brother-in-law, then turns slowly back to Ivan. Ivan stares, as tears of grief and rage run down his face. The bar patrons stare as he looks round at Magarri. Magarri enters tentatively, removing his hat, and approaches the bar. A woman glares at him, drawing on a cigarette, the tip glowing in the gloom. Ivan has placed a glass and a tin cup on the bar. Tears roll down Drover's cheeks. Reluctantly, Ivan replaces the cup with another glass. Ivan looks at Magarri and raises a glass. Magarri eyeballs him and glances at Drover. They all take a drink. The empty glasses are placed on the bar. Magarri wipes away a tear. Drover frowns in disbelief. Dutton checks the body on the stretcher. Sarah comes in. His eyes bore into her, trying to make her understand. A priest is down at the wharf. Drover releases the mooring, taking a chain out of Bull's unconscious hand, and runs onto the small Mission Island sailing boat. The priest prays. Magarri holds a rifle and Drover stands holding a rope, as they get underway. She stares, grief-stricken, at the devastation. The wooden buildings of the Mission burn fiercely in the night. Drover, Magarri and Ivan stand staring on the beach. He nods to Magarri, who moves off. Drover, fearful of what he might find, moves slowly up the beach. Weapons raised, they pass burning buildings and approach the tree line. Drover looks into a building and sees a row of boys' shoes. He looks horrified and lowers his rifle. His eyes fill with tears. He turns towards the noise, raising his rifle. Something is moving in the undergrowth. A boy emerges. Drover lowers his weapon, as more children come out of the undergrowth. He smiles with relief, as Magarri beckons the boys forward. Another figure with long hair appears. They embrace, throwing their arms around one another. Drover holds the boy out at arm's length and grins happily, stroking his hair. Nullah hangs his head sadly. A torch beam sweeps across the water towards them. They look around fearfully, as armed figures march out of the jungle through the smoke.",
    "1076": "Sarah gapes open-mouthed at the soaring crags. The herd moves towards a dark canyon. Sheer cliffs rise up on either side of the canyon, the bottom of which is in shadow. King George keeps watch from the top of the cliffs. Four horsemen approach, riding line abreast. A fire burns in the Drovers' camp. Nullah's sitting on a rock. Sarah's in her tent, writing. Flynn stares at the boy. Up on the cliff, King George makes a fire by drilling a stick into a piece of wood, and some kindling. She sticks her tongue out at him as he closes his eyes. King George looks up at the star-dusted sky. As the sun comes up the horse men arrive on the rocky ridge. They look down in the cattle huddled in the canyon shadows. Flynn takes his harmonica off Nullah. Something has spooked the cattle. Petrol from a metal can is sprinkled on the ground by Fletcher's men. Fletcher gets off his horse, and the bearded Bull holds up a flaming torch. He hurls it into the canyon. King George observes from his perch. Flynn and Nullah watch the torch falling through the darkness, and orange flames leap up as it hits the ground. Cattle stampede as fire erupts behind them. Drover clambers onto a rock and sees the herd thundering out of the canyon. Behind the herd is a wall of flame. Ahead of them, beyond the mouth of the canyon, is a sheer drop. Drovers urge their horses on, desperately trying to get ahead of the herd. They split into two groups, going either side of the herd. Fletcher's crew follow on a path along the cliff above. Nullah gallops along the cliff edge, heading the herd away from the precipice. Nullah turns and grins at Flynn. Cattle tumble into the abyss. Flynn's eyes widen in fear as the cliff edge curves round in front of them. They hurtle along with a sheer drop on one side and the mass of cattle on the other. Up on the cliff, Fletcher urges his horse on. Flynn rides next to Nullah on the cliff edge, showing off, riding one-handed. Fletcher and his men stop and look down at the herd, which is now heading across open ground. Fletcher gives a signal, and another fire is lit. As a wall of flame appears in front of the herd, Flynn's horse trips and he's thrown off. King George watches from a high outcrop. The fire's cut the herd off from open ground, and is funneling them towards the cliff. Nullah reins in his horse and looks towards Flynn, who's on the ground in the path of the stampede. The other riders try to reach Flynn, who looks in terror towards the oncoming herd.",

Chaya in a chair is lifted up to shoulder height and twirled around. Panchenko addresses Zus. As he walks by. Chaya and Asael are both held aloft by their well-wishers. Who jig up and down in a huddle. Together the young couple hold the napkin that was wrapped around the glass Asael crushed with his foot. Deep winter has set in at the Naliboki Forest Camp. A table and bench are blanketed in snow. A wheelbarrow stands marooned. Frozen washing hangs heavily on the line. A woman breaks the ice that has formed in a bucket of water. Next to her, Chaya, ladles out some soup to a long line of people. Asael, standing in a gutter nearby. He holds up two potatoes. Tuvia looks around at the ashen faces of the people queuing up for food.",
    "1087": "Malbin shakes his head. He looks behind him at Chaya, who is weeping. Tuvia crouches down. Tuvia's whole body is trembling. Malbin looks to Shimon for an answer. Tuvia stares ahead like a man who has lost his way. She brings out a revolver. He checks the chamber and hands it back to her. He cocks his own gun. Asael hands Layla over. Tuvia looks into Lilka's eyes then springs to his feet. Handing Asael the connected belts. Tuvia looks deeply into his fearless brother's face and kisses him gratefully on the cheek. The Bielski Otriad set off, treading carefully through the foot-high water, holding on to the rope made up of all their belts with one hand to keep their balance and to keep connected. As they proceed, the water level rises to their knees. A woman slips, but is helped to her feet. Asael, at the back, not holding the belt, loses his footing, but manages to keep his rifle above the water. Now, with the water level up to their waist, they trudge like a funeral cortege slowly and solemnly across the endless flat marsh. Asael and Tuvia at the head of the column wade through the mushy water. Shimon is being supported by Rachel and Malbin. A distant plane roars above their heads, but they trudge on. Children are carried on the adults' shoulders, as they wade through a reed bed, their steps making spirals in the placid surface of the water. Asael turns around to Malbin, who is trying to follow a map. In a narrow woodland area, Shimon, clutching his leather briefcase, starts to stumble. He falls to one side. Riva, the nurse, stops to attend him. Tuvia bends over his old teacher. Tuvia pulls the old man onto his back, leaving the leather bag of books behind. The winding column of men, women, and children emerges from the wooded area into bright sunshine and a flowing stream. People clamber out of the water onto a grassy bank, sinking down to rest their weary legs, smiling and laughing with relief. Shimon is brought up onto the meadow on a stretcher. Aaron runs up and taps Tuvia on the shoulder. He points across at Malbin next to his intellectual aspiring partner stroking the old man's grizzled and deathly pale face. Tuvia crouches down at Shimon's side. Malbin looks anxiously across at Tuvia, who wipes his eyes leveled on the old man's face as he breathes his last. Tuvia looks up sharply. A tank appears on the brow of the hill. Cannonballs explode among the fleeing Bielskis. Couching low, Tuvia sprints between the cowering people. Lilka passes ammo to those with guns. The German infantry are coming at them.",
    "1092": "Tuvia throws out some wire across the track. A German motorbike comes into view. The brothers watch it plow into the wire. The Bielskis swarm towards the German soldier sprawled on the ground. They relieve the dead man of his weapon and rifle through his saddle bags. A car's headlights appear in the distance. Zus and the others pick up the body, carry it to the side of the road and toss it down into the wood. They take up their positions and watch the car draw nearer. The driver gets out of the open-topped car to investigate the obstacle in the road. Driver peers to the side of the road near to where Zus and the others are hiding. The two Germans in the car and their female companion light up. The driver opens his fly and takes a leak all over Zus who tries to protect his face with his hands. The driver spots him. Zus stabs him. The other Germans are ambushed from behind. The sergeant shoots blindly into the darkness. Asael and others chase after a private. Zus unleashes a machinegun fire. Asael chases after the fleeing private and brings him down. Zus finishes up the Germans in the car. Asael shoots his prey point blank. The group examine the weapons they have collected. More headlights appear in the distance, shining their beams straight at them. The brothers line up and open fire into the dazzling light. Peretz is hit. Asael recoups more guns and runs into a field. Tuvia helps Peretz to his feet and pulls him away from the line of fire. He picks up another rifle and dashes into the bushes. An armored vehicle drives up. Soldiers jump off the back and run after Asael who's haring across a field. Tuvia' and pretz stop by and watch the truck slowing down. A search light on its route picks out Asael running across the field. Armed Germans go after Asael, but their bullets whiz past him. The heavy search light is on ground and picks out Tuvia, who fires straight at it, destroying the bulb. Asael pursued like an animal. He and Zus gather up their armory of guns and run. The next morning at their camp, sandy-haired Tuvia looks across at Zus with fury in his pale blue eyes. Laila is scraping the bottom of a cooking pot with a ladle. Shimon in his hat, coat, and woolen scarf, watches her grimly. Others in the camp look pale and gaunt. Aron, chewing on a piece of bread, hands it to Rachel, the teenage girl, and she devours it. Tuvia turns to Malbin, who's sitting with Peretz, whose eyes are open, but lifeless. Malbin shakes his head.",
    "1093": "A thin hollowed cheek man wanders towards them. Both Zus and Tuvia scramble to their feet and point their weapons. The tall stranger addresses him. With his machine gun over his shoulder, he takes a step backwards and surveys the group, his face angry and dismayed. All eyes are on Tuvia. He glances across at Zus, who is skulking by a tree. Everyone turns to young Aron. Tuvia's tough expression weakens, and his thin lips tremble. Zus looks from Aron to Tuvia, waiting for a response. Tuvia tries to compose his face. He steps towards Aron and cradles his head in his arms. Aron wraps his arms around his big brother. Zus runs after Lazar. Tuvia leaves Zus on the ground where he pushed him. Later hiding in some woodland with Zus and Benzion by his side. Tuvia appears through binoculars at Koscik's farmhouse. The three of them step towards it. Koscik's wife is in the garden hanging up washing. The three partisans armed with rifles come past a flock of geese on their way to the barn. Nearing the door, they stop as a pair of legs comes into view. Koscik is hanging from a rafter, with a wooden sign around his neck. Zus bangs a cross into the ground. Tuvia, holding a shovel, steps away from Koscik's newly dug grave. Her long, black skirt trailing on the ground, she leads the three men to a haystack, where Tuvia and Zus open the trapdoor. They peer down into a shelter and smile. The brothers help Asael out into the sunshine. Zus gives him a bear hug. Rifles. Two women climbed, one a teenager, the other in her 30s. Zus leads Bella and Chaya away. Tuvia thanks Koscik's widow. He runs after the others. At the camp Shimon and Malvin are shoving earth. The intellectuals shrug and get on with their digging. Asael is intently looking at the blond teenager. Tuvia gives Chaya a friendly wave. Asael strolls down to Chaya and Tuvia cracks a rare smile. An elderly Russian in a horse drawn cart trundles along the dirt track. Zus with his machine gun steps out in front of him. Asael and Ben Zion step out. Zus smiles doubtfully. Later, wearing the man's coat and carrying two churns, Zus leads the way back through the woods. A man approaches Chaya. At dusk, Benzion comes up to Tuvia who is sitting by a fire, reading. Tuvia's rugged face stiffens. Benzion nods respectfully and leaves Tuvia alone. A young boy plays the violin. People in the camp sit quietly. Sadness and loss etched on their faces. Asael watches Chaya from a distance. At the bottom of a leaf strewn slope Tuvia stands alone by a stream grieving.",
    "1095": "At a rest stop, an old woman wrapped in a heavy shawl chews on some food. A man bites into an apple. Asael and Chaya sit together. People huddled on the ground look up at Tuvia, but only Zus stands up, draping his machine gun over his shoulder. Tuvia nods, and the two of them set off, both wearing caps and scarves wrapped around their necks. A Russian in a gray army coat and fur hat steps out from behind a tree. Soldiers surround the Bielski brothers. They put up their hands without resistance. Zus steps forward. The man shrugs and beckons for them to follow him. He strolls off ahead whistling. He leads them into a military camp past a soldier on horseback. A middle-aged man with bags under his eyes, a black fur hat and a black leather coat over his coffee uniform, emerges from a tent. Zus shoots a glance at his brother's impassive face. Says the commander with a smirk. Tuvia saluting. Panchenko returns the salute. The whistling Russian Gramov escorts them out of the camp. A view of a thick pine forest. Tuvia rides up on a white horse. And with quiet pride, watches his flock, young and old, busily building a new camp. Aron and Asael saw wood. Arkady hammers a roof beam. Shimon in his hat, overcoat, and scarf wields an axe. Malbin is using an axe handle to secure a nail. Tuvia tosses him a hammer. Zus overhearing scowls. Zus listens uneasily. Later, Asael comes into the camp with more people. Bella is peeling potatoes. Kneels down taking off his hat and kisses the ground. He looks round eagerly and address Benzion. Tuvia glances at Malbin. Itzak bends to kiss Tuvia's hand. Malbin leads Itzak away past Zus, who scowls at Tuvia. Chaya turns to Asael. Tuvia smiles coldly. Zus whacks Tuvia in the face. Asael and Chaya watch in dismay. Shimon, Malbin, Lazar and the others look accusingly at Zus. He steps towards Tuvia, who's looking at the blood on his fingers. Tuvia hits back and launches himself at his brother. Benzion tries to pull them apart, but is shoved to one side. Zus' next blow sends Tuvia reeling to the ground. Aron looks at them both in shock. Zus rolls Tuvia on his back with a flick of his foot. Tuvia slowly scrambles to his feet. Zus spits and whacks his brother again with another kick. He pulls him up with both hands and slams him back onto the muddy ground. He goes to do it again, but Tuvia fists him in the groin. He pushes Zus down on his back, picks up a round stone and prepares to throw it.",
    "1105": "Thao meets Walt near the house. Walt grabs his arm. Thao starts to walk away. Thao stops and looks back. Thao goes. Walt wanders off, frowning. Spider and one of his sidekicks come out of a house and walk over to the Honda, which is parked by the curb. They get in. They are watched from across the road by Walt, who's parked up in his pickup truck. He watches grim-faced as the Honda drives off. Walt picks up his Colt .45 automatic and cocks it. Then talks to Daisy. He gets out of the pickup truck. As Smokie comes out of the house, Walt grabs him. Walt throws him onto the lawn and kicks him repeatedly in the face. He follows up the kicks with a few punches. A cat scampers past and Walt draws his gun. Evening, it's raining as Walt drives his pickup truck back to his house. He parks up on his drive and gets out with Daisy. They walk up the steps onto the porch and Daisy crosses his path. He bends down and picks up a key from under an ornament. He winces as he straightens up and unlocks the door. He and Daisy go inside. Walt cooks a barbeque for Sue, Thao, their mother and Youa. Youa and Thao grin and nod. Walt points at the Gran Torino. Walt sits in his living room with Daisy, sipping a beer and watching a ball game on TV. Spider's car cruises down the street outside. As it passes Thao's house, gang members discharge a couple of MAC-10 machine guns into the building. Hearing the noise, Walt leaps up and takes his Colt out of a drawer. Bullets rip through Thao's house. Walt runs out onto his porch as the Honda speeds away. Walt watches it go, then runs down off the porch and dashes into Thao's house. He runs into the living room, where Thao is picking himself up. Thao has a minor neck injury. She comes downstairs. Thao makes a call. Thao turns to a grim-faced Walt and shakes his head. Thao begins to sob. Walt sits with Thao and his mother in their kitchen. Walt sips a rice liquor. Grandma sees a car go by outside. She hurries to the door and everyone follows. Sue comes in. Her face is a bleeding mass of contusions. Watching, Walt drops his glass. Sue is helped to a chair by her mother and Grandma. Blood runs down her face and legs. Thao clings to his mother and sobs. Appalled, Walt stares at Sue, his mouth hanging open. He walks away from Thao's house, pushing the Colt into his belt. He walks into his kitchen and leans against a worktop.",
    "111": "Forrest watches Jenny in the pickup as it drives away. Forrest, dressed in his uniform, sits on a log and looks out at a river. Mrs. Gump walks toward Forrest and sits down next to him on the log. Forrest leans down, placing his head on his mother's shoulder. The shadow of a helicopter over the rice field below. A soldier is manning a gun from inside the helicopter. The soldier looks left, Forrest and Bubba ride in the helicopter. The helicopter circles overhead, then lands at the firebase. Bubba and Forrest jump out of the helicopter with their gear. They walk and look around oddly. The soldier places a case of beer on a large stack of cases. He takes two beers out and walks away. In the background, soldiers are barbecuing steaks and drinking beer. Lieutenant DAN TAYLOR steps out of a tent. Shirtless, he holds a roll of toilet paper in his hand. Lt. Dan looks at Bubba. Forrest and Bubba look at each other oddly, they don't get the joke. Lt. Dan starts to walk. Bubba and Forrest grab their gear and follow him. Lt. Dan stops and looks at the boys. Lt. Dan steps over to a large black soldier named SERGEANT. A distant relative of Lt. Dan's, wearing a revolutionary war uniform, falls dead in the snow. Another relative, wearing a civil war uniform and bearing a striking resemblance to Lt. Dan, falls down dead. Another relative, wearing a World War II, falls down dead on the beach at Normandy. Lt.

Dan sits down out of sight in the latrine, then stands up, looking at the boys. Lt. Dan sits back down out of sight in the latrine. Bubba and Forrest look at each other. Forrest, Bubba, and other soldiers in the Fourth Platoon walk across the rice field. Some Vietnamese rice farmers are working as the soldiers walk past. Forrest's unit walks along a dirt road. Suddenly Lt. Dan holds up his fist, a signal for the unit to stop. He motions for them to get down. Forrest gets down and looks around. Lt. Dan motions for the lead soldier to get down. Lt. Dan crouches down. Lt. Dan looks at the soldiers and points to his eyes. He lies down on the dirt road and crawls. Tex holds up his hand, motioning that he doesn't know. Forrest stands up and begins to walk with the platoon. Lt. Dan walks away as Forrest rushes over, aims two pistols in the hole, then climbs inside.",
    "1114": "Harry runs down a gloomy brick tunnel disturbing rats which scuttle from under his feet. Grounding a corner he finds to hurdle that the tunnel is blocked by an iron gating. Harry desperately shakes the buzz. But there are firmly fixed. He turns. The serpent appears behind him all those blocking the tunnel tract. Harry backs against the buzz. The gigantic mouth gates opened. The dripping poisonous fangs are inches from Harry's face. His got up in fingers find a loose piece of stone. He throws it back along the tunnel. Distracted the psycho serpent draws back. To Harry's relief it withdraws its head. It glides of backwards and makes it way down a different tunnel. Harry follows it cautiously and watches it as it gradually slips away and finally disappears altogether. He breathes a sigh of relief then quickly runs out of the dank tunnel and back to the main chamber. He finds Tom Riddle standing next to the unconscious Ginny. Harry kneels beside her. The serpent waves up behind Harry. Something glows inside the sorting hat. A silver sword. Harry grabs it. He waits as the across the stone flow towards the gigantic curved head and starts to climb. The serpent uncoils his huge body out of the water and lifts its head towards him. Balancing on an edge, Harry lashes out with the sword keeping the creature. It smashes its head blindly against the stone carving. Harry almost loses his grip. The serpent smashes against the stone head again. Chunks of stone fall into water of the lowest. Harry clings on with one hand. He regained his footing and climbs up even higher. Harry stands on the very top of the curved head. He swings the sword wildly. The serpent aims for the sound of the slashing sword. A lucky blow makes contact. But Harry is not of balance and drops the sword. As it slips over curved stone surface, he makes a grab for it. The serpent lunges. And Harry thrusts the sword up to the loop of escaping mouse. But huge poisonous fang breaks off and buries itself in his arm. He pulls it out quickly. Rearing into the act the serpent ranks in agony. Its huge body lashes from side to side gradually growing more feeble until it falls and crashes lifeless to the ground. Tom Riddle stares and disbelief at the dead serpent. He looks up and narrows his eyes as Harry staggers towards him holding the bloody sword in one hand and the Poison Fang in the other. Wincing with pain, Harry clutches the wound on his arm. He takes the few steps more before dropping the sword and collapsing on to the ground.",

ANOTHER DAY - The platoon walks through the jungle as rain pours down on them. ANOTHER DAY - The platoon shelters themselves as they walk through the wind and rain. Forrest holds his hand up to protect his face. ANOTHER DAY - Forrest and other soldiers walk chest-deep through a river. The rain splatters back up from the river, hitting the soldiers. The rain pours down on the men of the platoon as they sit in a camp. Bubba sits down next to Forrest. Bubba leans his back up against Forrest's back. ANOTHER NIGHT - Some soldiers patrol the area. Forrest lies in a pup tent and writes a letter as the rain pours down. He uses his flashlight to see. Jenny steps out of the trailer with a backpack and a guitar. She hugs a hippie guy, then jumps into the back of a Volkswagen bus with another guy. Forrest writes a letter in his tent. The Fourth Platoon makes their way through the jungle and rain. Forrest looks up as the sun suddenly appears. Forrest's platoon is attacked. A bullet kills the soldier standing next to Forrest. Bombs explode all around as the soldiers scramble to the ground. Forrest crawls over a berm as bullets fly overhead and explode all around him. Forrest rolls over and pulls his pack off Lt. Dan lies next to Forrest.

    "1128": "A peaceful winter's day, a tree-lined river flows through a countryside white with frost. Hermione fetches water from the river. She walks up the steep bank. Later, she sits reading by a smoking campfire with her back leaning against a tree. Harry comes out of the tent, which is pitched behind her. They're both wearing warm winter sweaters. Hermione has a blanket over her legs. She looks up at him. He looks around. They both look thoughtful. She hands him Rita Skeeter's book. He looks at the photographs. She frowns. A worried expression on her face, she lifts the blanket and reveals his wand in pieces. Harry sits keeping watch, leaning back against the tree. The blanket over his shoulders, he holds Hermione's wand. He takes out the piece of broken mirror. He gazes into it. The mirror reflects an empty room. He drops the mirror onto the ground. He wraps the blanket tight around his shoulders. Behind him, a dim light glows inside the tent. Clutching Hermione's wand, Harry looks deep into the forest. His eyes widen as he spots a light in the distance. It comes closer. Glowing ever brighter, the light takes the shape of a translucent silvery doe. Harry shrugs off the blanket. He gets to his feet. He moves cautiously towards it. He stops and watches. The doe turns and moves slowly away. Harry follows. The doe stops and glances back, then moves on. The doe trots across a stretch of frozen water with a light covering of frost. The shape of the doe shrinks to a ball of light. The tip of Hermione's wand glows as Harry steps gingerly onto the ice. As he nears the light, it floats towards him, then sinks below the ice. He crouches down. He wipes away the frost from the surface. A sword lies gleaming under the ice. Harry looks around cautiously, then aims the wand. Harry stands up. The ice above the sword cracks. A hole appears. At the water's edge, Harry removes his clothes, except for his boxer shorts. He still has the locket around his neck. He treads barefoot and wearily across the frost-covered ice until he reaches the hole. He places Hermione's wand on the edge and submerges his right foot in the water. Shivering, he gazes at the sword, takes a breath, and drops feet first through the hole in the ice. He swims down towards the gleaming sword. He reaches out to grasp it. Suddenly, he grabs the chain of the locket. He struggles for breath. The snake rears up and attacks. Hermione's spell stuns the snake. Hermione reaches out and grabs it. She and Harry disapparate through the window.",
    "1132": "Harry sits in his room, holding a shard of broken mirror. He stares pensively at his own reflection, then sees an eye that is not his own looking back at him. Hegwig is sitting patiently in her cage. Harry packs a rucksack. He takes a notebook with the letters RAB written in it, a gold locket on a chain, and a newspaper with Dumbledore's obituary by Elphias Doge. Harry comes down the stairs, holding his rucksack and Hegwig's cage. The living room is bare. He opens the door of the cupboard under the stairs and peers inside. He pulls a cord. The light in the cupboard comes on. Harry steps inside what was once his bedroom and slowly shakes his head. He spots a toy soldier wielding a sword. Harry picks up the metal soldier, and places it in the palm of his hand. He studies it, his face solemn, then puts it back. He opens the front door. Hagrid, Ron, and Hermione. Mad-eye Moody, Mr. Weasley, and Kingsley Shacklebolt follow them inside. Hermione has plucked a hair from Harry's head. She puts it in the flask Moody's holding. Fleur Delacour's with Bill, the Weasley twins, Remus Lupin, and Nymphadora Tonks stand nearby. Moody glares at Fred. He sips, grimaces, passes the flask to George, and starts to shrink. George also pulls a face and shrinks. Mundungus drinks and grows a little. The flask is passed to Fleur, then Ron, and finally, Hermione. They all change physically until each one looks like Harry. Moody retrieves the flask from Hermione, then joins the real Harry. They both survey the six Harry Potter lookalikes. He empties clothes onto the floor. The real Harry steps out of the front door with Hedwig on his arm. The snowy owl spreads her wings and flies away into the night sky. Harry's in Hagrid's motor bag sidecar. Some ride broomsticks. Bill Weasley rides a thestral, a winged, skeletal horse. Decoy Harrys on broomsticks sweep past Moody. Hagrid rides his motorbike up into the air, forcing Moody to duck. Two thestrals zoom over his head. In the sidecar, Harry grips the windscreen as Moody passes on a souped-up broomstick. Lightning flashes through the clouds. Harry clings to the windscreen. Death eaters appear and zoom over the decoy Harrys. They race through the glowering clouds. The decoys draw some death eaters away. Hagrid presses a button. A burst of flame shoots out of the rear, propelling the bike forward. They land on the motorway. Death eaters in pursuit. Harry aims his wand. A death eater crashes to the ground. A caravan veers out of control and tips over. Hagrid swerves into oncoming traffic to avoid it. Still on the wrong carriageway, he heads into a tunnel.",
    "1134": "Lupin sinks onto a chair, his head lowered. George looks solemn. Giant Hagrid, his head wedged behind a roof beam, gazes blankly. Harry turns away, his face sad and pale. Later, Ron is asleep in bed. Across the room, Harry is also asleep but dreaming of Dumbledore and the Horcruxes. Cameras flash. He sees the locket, the diary, a staring eye, a ring on Dumbledore's finger. Dreaming of Voldemort and the old wand maker, Harry stirs and wakes. Ashen-faced he lies on his back. He stares up at the ceiling. Harry snatches up his wand. His rucksack on his back he secretly leaves the Weasley's house. He starts to stride away. Ron comes out of the house. He follows Harry. Harry stops and turns round. Harry stares at Ron. Ron looks back at the house. Ron steps closer to Harry. The two friends' eyes are fixed on each other. Harry takes off his rucksack. He drops it on the ground. He turns away. Ron picks it up and slings it over his shoulder. They head back towards the house. He reads a headline. In moving picture, Dumbledore closes the massive doors of Hogwarts School. The back of her beaded dress is unfastened. He walks over and stands behind her, hesitating for a moment. She half-turns to him. He zips up her dress. Ginny turns towards him. They kiss. George tiptoes in cleaning his teeth a bandage over his ear. He sticks his toothbrush in his ear. He picks up a cup and drinks. Ginny spots him and breaks away from Harry. George smiles and winks. Harry gently strokes Ginny's arm as she slips away. Looking slightly embarrassed, Harry grins. George gives him a knowing look. Mr. Weasley organizes the erection of a marquis outside the house. The Weasley brothers and Hagrid use their wands to magically raise the huge tent. A tall figure strides towards the house. Hermione and Harry face Rufus Scrimgeour in the living room. Ron joins Hermione and Harry on the sofa. The Minister lays a flat pouch on the table. Scrimgeour takes a document from his briefcase. It floats in front of him opening as it does so. He unfastens the pouch and hands the Deluminator to Ron. Ron unwraps a small cylindrical metal object. Ron presses a switch. The light from two lamps is absorbed by the Deluminator. He switches it off and on again. The light flies back to the lamps. Ron grins. The others look blank. He unwraps the Golden Ball. The Minister holds it out in a cloth. Harry reaches out. He tentatively takes the Snitch. He studies the Golden Ball. Scrimgeour and Hermione both look expectant, then disappointed. Harry turns the Snitch over in his hand.",
    "1136": "Lights come on in the hall. They close the front door. Gray smoke rises from the tiled floor in the long narrow corridor ahead of them. It swells towards them. A ghostly Dumbledore appears. His hand reaches out. The face disappears. The smoke dissipates. They freeze. Hermione steps forward and raises her wand. Harry dreams of Voldemort threatening the wand maker, Ollivander. He wakes from his dream. He's lying fully clothed on a sofa. On a sofa opposite, Hermione's still asleep. Her left hand's hanging over the edge almost touching Ron's hand. Ron sleeps on the floor between them. Harry hauls himself upright. Using the glowing tip of his wand to light the way. Harry mounts a staircase. His shadow is cast on the wall. He turns the handle. Pushing the door open, he stands in the doorway. Light floods in through a dusty window. Inside the room he pulls a cord. Two skeletal bats flap their bony wings. Harry looks around. On top of a chest of drawers he finds a dusty old book. Harry looks back at the book. Hermione enters another room. It's a mess with a mattress falling off the bed. Ron indicates the name of the door. Harry reads the message in the locket. Hearing a noise, they turn towards it. Harry gets up. He cautiously crosses the room towards a door in the corner. Harry yanks it open revealing house elf. Harry holds up the replica. Kreacher stares at the locket. Kreacher disapparates. The Hogwarts Express puffs its way across a barren landscape. In the train, Ginny sits with Neville Longbottom. Death Eaters fly over the engine. A dark figure stands on the tread. He halts the train. A student, Cormac, confronts the Death Eaters as they walk through the carriages. Death Eaters approach Ginny and Neville. Dressed in pink, Dolores Umbridge stands beside Pius Thicknesse. A man is dragged towards the new Minister. Mundungus sells stolen property. He sees a group of snatchers. He scurries away taking shelter in an alley. The reward posters of Harry, Undesirable Number One are pasted on the walls. Hermione plays. Ron watches her with puppy dog eyes. She glances at him. He tries again. Harry stares at the Snitch fluttering in front of him. Hermione joins Harry. He takes hold of the Snitch. The Snitch's wings fold. Harry stares at the Golden Ball. They all look round. Harry and Hermione run past Ron into the kitchen. Kreacher has Mundungus round the head. Dobby clings to his leg. They close in on Mundungus. He sees a photograph in a newspaper on the floor. He picks it up. He puts it on the table. A city street with stone buildings.",
    "1138": "Harry slips inside Umbridge's office. The walls at the office are hung with China plates showing pictures of cats. Harry raises his wand. Umbridge's chair is upholstered in pink. Harry notices two passive pink shoes placed neatly on the floor. He crosses to the desk. There's a silver teapot and a China cup and saucer on lace doilies. He searches drawers. He finds files with photos attached. One is of Mad-Eye Moody with a red cross through the photo. Another is of Professor Dumbledore crossed through in red. The Supervisor turns. Harry emerges from Umbridge's office. Grim-faced, Harry turns and walks away. He's sopping wet. Harry and Ron leave the lift at courtroom level. The man is hauled away by two guards. Harry tugs Ron's lapel. They walk towards the courtroom. From a high bench Umbridge addresses a woman sitting below. Umbridge wears the locket around her neck. Mary sees Ron. Harry pushes Ron forward into the courtroom. Harry stays back himself. Yaxley sits watching the proceedings. Ron stands beside Mary. Harry nods. She holds it up. Dementors hover above. Harry's eyes are fixed on Umbridge. He has spotted the locket around her neck. His wand drops into his hand. Umbridge sees it. Hermione trembles. His face distorts. Ron zaps Yaxley. Hermione grabs the locket from Umbridge. She tosses it to Harry, now back to himself. Yaxley sees them race off. The hovering Dementors chase the group into the lift. They're stopped by the closing gate. Their arms and long-boned fingers reach through the metal grill. They attempt to suck the souls out of the four in the lift. Harry raises his wand. The Dementors are forced back by the spell. The lift zooms upwards. The atrium is busy. There are people upon walkways and others at ground level. A lift arrives. The group look around the atrium before stepping out into it. Hermione and Harry are both back to themselves. Ron still looks like Reginald. Mary clings to him. She takes Ron's face in her hands. She kisses him on the lips. During the kiss Ron shrinks. He transforms back to himself. Mary steps back. The real Reginald appears in his vest and boxers. He sees Ron. Ron turns. Uniformed guards chase Harry. Yaxley arrives in the lift. Hermione and Ron race after Harry. Yaxley barges past people hurling bursts of energy at the trio, narrowly missing them. Harry spins his wand at a pile of posters. The reward posters for Harry Undesirable Number One swirl around the atrium almost engulfing Yaxley. He brushes them aside. The trio reach the corridor. Yaxley aims another burst. The spell disarms Yaxley. Ron grimaces as he runs. He glances back. Yaxley is gaining on him.",
    "1141": "Later, the pace hots up. The hall is jumping. Tiny Professor Flitwick is passed over the heads of the dancers. To Parvati and Padma's annoyance, Harry and Ron won't dance. The four of them sit glumly at the end of the room. Hermione dances wildly with Victor. Ron and Harry glare at Krum. Parvati is asked to dance. She gets up with relief. Padma looks exasperated. Ron spots Krum kissing Hermione's hand. Viktor leaves her. She spins around, her face flushed. Smiling happily, she sinks down beside Harry, Ron, and Padma. Ron gives a great sigh. Hermione gets up. She goes to speak, thinks better of it, turns her back, and walks off. Padma glares at Ron. Padma gets up and stalks off. Later, Ron tries to reason with Hermione. She wipes away a tear. The boys escape up the stairs. Hermione flops miserably on the bottom step, takes off her party shoes, and rubs her feet. Neville is still dancing with Ginny. Hagrid rests his head on Madame Maxime's chest. His hand slips to her bottom. She puts it firmly back on her waist. Disturbed by the bell, crows rise into the darkness. They swoop between the tall towers past one or two lighted windows. Snowflakes whirl outside the boys' bedroom. A large black crow flutters down onto the windowsill and peers in. Asleep in bed, Harry is having a nightmare. He sees the dark cemetery with the winged stone statue. The cloaked skeleton clutches the long scythe. Behind it, stands the snow-covered mansion. Along the dusty paneled corridor, light shines from the open door. Inside the room, Wormtail hovers as the young man kneels beside the armchair, revealing the dark mark tattooed on his arm. The large snake whispers to the figure hidden in the armchair. A green flash. Harry's eyes spring open. Neville appears, his dancing shoes slung around his neck. He waltzes off. Harry smiles. Hermione looks concerned as Harry walks away. Harry looks weary. Harry nods. Cedric gives Harry a knowing smile and goes. In the prefect's bathroom, Harry slips off his dressing gown and lowers himself into a bath the size of a small swimming pool. He leans back under the bubbles. A mermaid in a stained glass window holds back her long golden hair to watch him. Harry turns to the golden egg standing on the side of the bath. He opens the eggs. He slams it shut again. A ghostly figure appears out of the lavatory. She floats towards him. She dives into the bubbles. Harry grabs the egg. He twists it open under the water. The egg glows brightly. Harry takes a deep breath and sinks down after it. He bursts to the surface.",
    "1142": "She peers mischievously into the water. Harry attempts to preserve his modesty with some bubbles. Myrtle leans her head on his naked shoulder. In the library, Ron puts the golden egg on the table. He and Hermione leave reluctantly. Harry piles up his books and tidies his notes. Moody leaves them alone. Harry looks at Neville apologetically. At the lake, Fred and George take bets. Neville hands over the gillyweed. Three tall spectator pavilions have been erected in the lake. Harry chokes on the gillyweed. Three of the competitors dive in. Moody pushes Harry in after them. Gasping for breath, he sinks down amongst the metal supports of the pavilions. He clutches his neck. Gills develop on either side like a fish. He looks down and sees his feet turn into flippers. He held up his hands as they become webbed. Seamus stares down into the water. Harry suddenly hurtles up out of the water. He somersaults in the air like a dolphin and vanishes again under the surface. Harry kicks out with his flippers and swims through the water weed over the rocks-strewn bed of the lake. It falls away in front of him into a deep ravine. He dives into the murky darkness. Arms held close by his sides. Fish swim beside him as he moves easily through the water. He's wearing shorts and a singlet with Potter written on the back. His wand is in a sheath, strapped to his leg. He heads through a narrow channel, peering uncertainly through the cloudy water. He swims through ropes of dark green weed hanging like curtains in front of him. Harry looks over his shoulder and spots a figure behind. Fleur is swimming strongly, a delicate filmy veil over her mouth and nose. Her long fair hair streams behind her. Something whips past her face. Fleur certainly disappears, pulled down out of sight. Harry is knocked aside by something as it flashes past. Recovering himself, he catches sight of a silvery tail vanishing into the Forest of Weed. Harry follows the merperson as it leads him above the jagged rocks on the bottom of the lake. Far ahead, he sees the ruins of a stone archway. He kicks out strongly with his flipper feet. Tall columns rise around him like an underwater cathedral. He swims past ruined archways, their outline softened by algae and water weed. Four people in black cloaks float upright in front of him - Ron, Hermione, Cho, and a small girl with long fair hair. Their eyes are closed, their face is blank. Unfriendly looking merpeople lurk, ominously close, carrying sharp tridents, and lashing their tails. Harry unties the rope around Ron's ankle. He moves toward Hermione.",
    "1144": "On his way out, Moody gives Harry a long look. The tadpole-like licorice snaps attract Harry's attention. He takes a handful. They nip his fingers with their sharp, little teeth. He drops them onto the floor and stomps on them. Behind him, the doors of a cabinet swing open. A blue light glows from a large, stone vase in front of a flicking mirror. Harry slowly walks towards it. Reflected in the mirror, he gazes down into the shining blue bowl. The cloudy surface swirls. Harry sees a glow at the bottom of a deep shaft. He finds himself falling down into a crowded courtroom. He lands in a chair, sitting next to someone he recognizes. The man next to him shakes hand with Professor Dumbledore right through Harry. A disheveled man appears in a cage in front of the judge, Mr. Crouch. Rita Skeeter gasps. Moody aims his wand at a young man hurrying from his seat. Barty is dragged to the bench. His tongue flickers like a snake. Mr. Crouch is transfixed, horrified. Harry falls from the bowl to the floor in Professor Dumbledore's room. He puts his wand to his temple and drops a thread of memory into the pensieve. Leaving Dumbledore's room, Harry hears voices from the open door of Snape's store room. Harry sees the dark mark on Karkaroff's arm. Karkaroff leaves quickly. He shows Harry a small bottle. Tiny Professor Flitwick conducts the school band. The stands are crowded with flag-waving supporters. An enthusiastic, Mr. Diggory runs in, encouraging the crowd to cheer as an embarrassed Cedric enters the arena. Fleur follows. Her classmates perform a cheerleader routine. Draco and his crony support Viktor Krum, who appears with Karkaroff. A concerned Dumbledore accompanies Harry who looks around nervously. Standing in front of a tall hedge, Dumbledore addresses the crowd. They gather around Dumbledore. Harry stands before a narrow opening in the hedge. Mr. Diggory hugs Cedric tearfully. Harry gives Cedric a friendly nod. Once again, Filch lights the canon too soon. Moody pats Harry encouragingly on the shoulder as he tentatively enters the maze. Dumbledore watches him go. Harry looks back towards the entrance and sees Moody pointing surreptitiously to the left. He stares uncertainly down the narrow, misty path. Suddenly, the hedges close together behind him, blocking the way out. Harry swallows hard and follows the direction Moody has indicated. Each long path looks exactly the same. The thick, hewn hedges rise 25 feet on either side. Above his head, he can only see a narrow strip of sky. The intricate maze extends far around him stretching away into distance of mist covered valley. Harry moves slowly and cautiously between the hedges. He turns and looks behind him fearfully.",
    "1150": "It lands on a desk, then on a boy's head. It crawls up a girl's arm. Moody flicks his wand. The spider hovers over Ron. It drops into Ron's hair. The spider clamps itself on Draco's face. It hits the glass. Controlled by Moody's wand, the spider hovers helplessly over a bucket of water. Moody carefully directs it to the palm of his hand. Neville puts up his hand. Neville steps towards the table. The spider writhes in agony. Neville looks distraught. His face is twisted with anger. Hermione cries out. Moody lowers his wand, withdrawing the curse. Neville's eyes are tight shut. His face is clammy. Moody places the spider in front of Hermione. She shakes her head. A flash of green light. The spider dies. His mad eye swivels round to stare down at Harry, who looks up at him warily. Moody nervously licks his lips and takes a swig from his hip flask. Harry regards him thoughtfully. Leaving the classroom, Ron follows Hermione and Harry down a circular stone staircase. Moody appears as they spot a sad figure. Neville reluctantly follows Moody back up the stairs. The rain runs like tears down the face of a woman in a stained-glass window. Students splash across the courtyard with cloaks over their heads to protect themselves from the rain. The goblet of fire stands in the great hall. Eligible students cross the circle of light drawn around it on the floor, reach up, and place their name into the blue flame. Cedric Diggory's supporters push him forward. He steps through the circle and puts his name into the stone goblet. Ron gives Cedric an encouraging wave. Fred and George run into the hall in triumph. They each swallow the contents of a test tube and jump inside the circle. They put their names into the goblet. Engulfed in blue flames, Fred and George are flung out of the circle. They both have white hair and long, white beards. They grapple with each other, rolling over and over on the stone floor. Hermione shakes her head, sits on the stone steps, and opens a book. Accompanied by a Durmstrang student and their teacher, Karkaroff, Viktor Krum approaches the circle. With a serious look on his face, he strides forward confidently and puts his name into the goblet. As he turns away, he catches Hermione's eye. She gives him a faint, admiring smile. The students assemble excitedly in the great hall. Dumbledore raises his hand. The flames of the burning torches around the hall gradually die down one by one. Everyone looks expectant. Arm outstretched, Dumbledore approaches the goblet of fire. The blue flame turns red. A piece of charred parchment flutters down into his hand.",
    "1152": "The room is deserted. He starts to read. Turning the page, he finds Rita's article. He crumples up the newspaper and throws it into the fireplace. Sparks fly out of the fire. The image of a face forces itself through the glowing embers. Harry looks nervously over his shoulder as he hears the sounds of a door. A shadow moves on the stairs. Ron appears in his pajamas. Ron turns and goes back up the stairs. Harry looks into the embers again, but serious his face has gone. The newspaper starts to burn. Harry reads the headline. Then the paper is consumed by the flames. Neville is collecting plants in the lake. Harry opens a book. He waves to Ginny, Ron, and Hermione. Harry gets up. Ron whispers to Hermione. She approaches Harry. Hermione looks exasperated. Ron whispers to her again. Ron scowls at Harry as the trio leave. Late that night in the forest. Harry stares at him. They both stop. Hagrid looks around. He hurries forward. Harry puts on the invisibility cloak and disappears instantly. Harry grimaces. Huge flames burst from four enormous crates standing in a clearing. Madame Maxime gapes and moves nearer. Harry throws off the cloak. A dragon breathes a burst of flame. They bar Harry's way. He pushes past. Harry finds Cedric. He takes Cedric aside. Moody watches, unseen. Harry spots Ron. Ron and Seamus stalk off. He drops down from a tree. Draco goes for his wand. Moody turns Draco into a ferret. The ferret is flung up and down helplessly. He puts it down Crabbe's trousers. Moody winks at Harry as the ferret emerges from Crabbe's trouser leg. McGonagall breaks the spell. Draco reappears. Moody chases him off. Moody pulls a face behind her back. Harry follows him. Moody opens the door to his cluttered room. He hobbles painfully towards a chair and sits down. To Harry's surprise, he unfastens his artificial metal leg and places it on a stand. He leans back in his chair. Harry stares at a cloudy mirror. Moody kicks a stool towards him. Harry looks blank. In a wooden arena on a craggy hillside, Fred and George take bets from their fellow students. The Triwizard competitors pace restlessly in their tent as Dumbledore announces the contest. Harry goes to a gap in the tent. She bursts in and throws her arms around his neck. Rita and her photographer. Rita looks Krum up and down. She strokes his cheek with her quill. Fleur puts her hand into the bag and takes out a tiny dragon. She shows it fearfully to the towering Madame Maxime. Krum picks out a dragon. Cedric takes his turn. Harry puts his hand into the bag.",
    "1157": "Harry invades Snape's memories. He sees him unhappy. He sees Snape humiliated by his father. Back in the storeroom, his face twisted with anger, Snape grabs Harry viciously and peers into his face. Harry cowers and runs from Snape's room. He hears crying in the corridor and finds the twins comforting a small boy. Umbridge stands watching them. She goes. The O.W.L. exams begin. The great hall is set out with long rows of desks. Hermione is busily writing. Ron sighs and looks worried. Harry watches Umbridge. She stands on the stage in front of a huge swinging pendulum. Her smug smile fades. Several students turn to look at the door behind them. Umbridge strides purposefully down the middle of the hall towards the great wooden doors. Everyone stops writing and turns to look. Umbridge opens the door. A fizzing firework hovers in front of her nose and whizzes into the hall, where it explodes in a shower of sparks. Umbridge looks anxiously around the empty hallway. Suddenly, Fred and George hurtle over her head on broomsticks. They zoom backwards and forwards, flinging exam papers and whiz bangs into the air. The multicolored fireworks spiral down and explode, scattering the papers in all directions. Goyle gets a firework in his face. Crabbe, a whiz bang up his backside. Another attacks Draco. Filch rushes in. One of the twins gives a signal. His brother flings a large firework into the air. With a flash, the head of a flaming, fiery dragon appears and heads for Umbridge. Its mouth full of white hot teeth. She races for the door. The dragon bursts out after her and explodes destroying the hundreds of decrees that Filch has nailed to the wall. The frames come clattering down in a shower of glass, paper, and splintered wood. Fred and George fly from the building and swoop out over the battlements on their broomsticks, flinging fireworks as they go. Delighted students rush out into the courtyard, applauding the magnificent display. Professor Flitwick is among them looking rather confused. A huge fiery letter W appears in the sky. Ron smiles with pride. Professor Flitwick punches the air, then looks around self-consciously. Harry's face grows pale. He collapses in slow motion. Hermione sees him fall. Harry is overwhelmed by an image of Sirius being tortured by Voldemort. Sirius gasps. His face contorts with pain. Harry sees the number 97. The glass sphere. The black corridor. The blue door. Hermione kneels beside him anxiously. Hermione looks at Ron. They enter Umbridge's study. The white cat leaves his China plate through a cat flap. Harry throws flue powder into the fire. Draco drags in Neville. Umbridge leans over Harry. Harry looks at Ron and Hermione.",
    "1163": "The two of them step out into a corridor. The walls and floor are lined with shiny black tiles. They see Fudge talking to Lucius Malfoy. Outside the courtroom, Harry nods nervously. The jurors exchange glances. He approaches Fudge. Dumbledore sighs and addresses the members of the jury. Some jurors murmur to each other. Fudge raises his hand. With a sickly smile, the Undersecretary raises hers. Others follow suit. Many more jurors raise their hands. Mrs. Figg raises hers, then makes to scratch her ear. Amelia Bones raises her hand. Harry jumps to his feet. Dumbledore has gone. At Kings Cross Station, Moody and Nymphadora Tonks lead Harry and the Weasley family across a footbridge. A large black dog hesitates beside Harry. The huge dog trots into a waiting room and turns into a man. Harry runs in after him. A group photograph of 20 people is present. In the photo, Harry's parents stand beside Sirius. Harry hands the photograph back to Sirius. Harry walks along the platform, crowded with Hogwarts' students and their families. He sees the tall, gaunt figure of Voldemort facing him. The Dark Lord twists and flexes his neck. On the train, Harry sits in a corner of the carriage. He shifts uneasily, twisting and flexing his neck. Hermione sits besides him and glances at Ron. As evening falls, the Hogwarts Express speeds along the coast, a plume of white smoke streaming from the funnel. Hogwarts School sits beside a river running down to the sea. They emerge from the train. Draco Malfoy struts along the platform. Ron holds Harry back. Harry shakes Ron off. Outside the station, four girls sit in a horseless carriage. One of them is Cho, a pretty Oriental girl. She smiles at Harry. The carriage pulls away. Harry stares after it. As they wait for another carriage, Neville joins them, carrying a cactus. Harry turns and sees a strange creature behind him. It has a head like a horse. It stretches its long leathery neck. Puzzled, Harry inspects the animal more closely. In the carriage behind it, a girl with long blond hair sits reading a magazine. She's holding it upside down. They all climb in. Hermione shifts uncomfortably. They all look confused. In the great hall, Luna and the other students tuck into a luscious assortment of puddings. Harry has an empty space beside him. He looks over at Seamus, who pointedly ignores him. He stops as Professor Umbridge, the former Undersecretary, rises smiling primly. She's a small woman in a sugar-pink suit with matching accessories. The twins are not convinced. She beams at Dumbledore. Filch applauds enthusiastically. Harry walks into the Gryffindor common room. Everyone turns to look at him. Ron glares around the common room then follows Harry upstairs.",
    "1164": "Harry kicks his trunk. Ron is taken aback. Ron goes, leaving Harry alone. Harry sits on his bed staring into space. He twists and flexes his neck. A blue door at the end of a black tiled corridor. Harry tosses and turns in his sleep. The black corridor. Veins twist under Harry's skin. The black corridor. The blue door. A glass sphere. A bony hand. Harry wakes drenched with sweat to see Ron watching him with concern. A classroom. A girl launches a white paper airplane. It becomes an intricate paper bird and flutters its wings. Seamus takes a swipe at it. The bird flies out of reach and soars around the classroom. Crabbe aims his catapult. The bird hovers. It burst into flames. Professor Umbridge lowers her wand. She points her wand. Books distribute themselves on the student's desks. She gives a sickly smile. Students lower their eyes nervously. Searching for words, Umbridge glances around the classroom. She walks slowly towards Harry. Sitting in her pink office, Umbridge puts three spoonfuls of pale pink sugar into a china cup decorated with pink roses. Cats move around on the china plates on the wall. She stirs her tea. Umbridge puts down the cup and touches a pen lying on her desk. Harry opens the door and looks at the plates on the wall. A white cat stares at him from one of the plates. She places a curled brown quill in front of him. Umbridge looks out of the window and smiles with secret anticipation. Harry starts to write with the quill in his right hand. To his surprise, the words appear on the paper written in red. Umbridge smiles again as Harry winces with pain. An angry red arc appears on the back of his left hand and then another. He sees words. As Harry writes on the paper, the words appear cut into the skin on the back of his hand. Harry looks at the quill in disbelief. Umbridge stands in front of Harry and smiles sweetly down at him, her eyebrows raised. Harry boldly meets her gaze then blinks. She leans over him, smiling with satisfaction. Fred and George try out their inventions. Ron and Hermione sit beside Harry. He turns a page of his book. He shows his right. She looks at the scars. Harry walks off, leaving Hermione and Ron looking bewildered. Harry's owl, Hedwig, flies away from Hogwarts. Standing outside Hagrid's deserted cottage. Harry sees a large winged creature swoop down into the Forbidden Forest. Harry wanders alone through the Forbidden Forest. He spots a group of the horse-like creatures he saw pulling the carriage. They have huge bat-like wings. A girl is stroking the nose of one of them.",
    "1165": "She's barefoot. Harry looks up at the reptilian creature. They see a baby Thestral. She takes an apple from her bag. The baby Thestral squawks. She rolls the apple to the baby. Luna throws down a piece of raw meat. Ignoring the apple, the baby Thestral flaps its wings and gobbles up the meat. Ron gobbles a sausage at breakfast. Harry approaches the table. On the stairs, McGonagall is affronted. Filch hammers in a nail and hangs a decree. Umbridge has been appointed Hogwarts' high inquisitor. Pink suede shoes stalk the corridor. Umbridge interrogates Professor Trelawney. Snape swipes Ron. The twins play tricks with a firework. Umbridge destroys it. Filch climbs a ladder. More decrees. Umbridge smiles smugly to herself. Filch swings his ladder. Students duck. He swings it back. They duck again. Trelawney gapes. Umbridge measures the height of tiny Professor Flitwick as he conducts the choir. Trelawney's eyes look round desperately behind her huge glasses. Umbridge ticks a box and leaves the classroom. Students crowd into the cloisters. Professor Trelawney stands in the courtyard, looking devastated. She sits on a trunk. Filch brings out more of her luggage. Umbridge comes out of the main door and approaches purposefully. Professor Trelawney gets up and bumps into a suitcase. She starts to weep. Umbridge is unmoved. Umbridge holds up a decree. McGonagall comforts Trelawney. The great main doors swing open. Dumbledore appears. The students watch with baited breath. Umbridge smiles a knowing smile. Harry pushes his way through the crowd of students, but Dumbledore has gone. In the common room. Harry turns up the radio. In the fire, his image fades away into the embers. A flash of lightning. Lightning illuminates the room. Hermione looks directly at Harry. Rain streams down the diamond-shaped window panes. The rain turns to swirling snow, briefly forming the face of Voldemort. The sun rises over the snow-covered village of Hogsmeade. The three friends trudge towards the decrepit Hogshead Inn. They peer inside. A goat walks through the bar. Hermione addresses around 20 students. He glances at Cho. Students shift uncomfortably. He sits down. She takes a deep breath. Harry nods. Hermione, Harry and Ron sit at a table. Walking back to Hogwarts, Harry consults his friends. Harry grins. Umbridge watches from a high tower as they return to school. Filch leans close as she gives him instructions. Neville hurries away from the bullying Crabbe and Goyle. Walking along the corridor, an odd sound causes him to stop. He turns back, bewildered. An intricate carving appears in the stone wall in front of him, and then a large archway. As Neville watches, the carved stone becomes a pair of huge, wooden double doors. The doors swing open, revealing a long room lined with shadowy mirrors.",
    "1168": "Luna's silvery Patronus disappears. The room grows dark. The students look around, nervously. A huge mirror cracks and shatters. Nigel peers through a hole in the stone wall behind it, and sees Umbridge and her squad. She aims her wand. Harry pulls Nigel away. The wall implodes. Chunks of stones fly into the room in a cloud of dust. Umbridge beams with satisfaction. Harry sees that Draco is holding Cho. She looks tearful and distressed. Dumbledore winks at Harry. Fawkes the phoenix swoops down. Man and bird disappears in a burst of flame. Filch climbs a high, tottering ladder. They read the latest decree. To make more space on the wall, Filch removes a painting of six men in Elizabethan dress inspecting a skeleton. They look up in alarm. Filch tips the painting to one side. They all slide out of sight. The intricate locking mechanism on the school's main doors slides into place. The great hall. The members of Dumbledore's army take their punishment. They write without ink using Umbridge's curled brown quills. She sits on the stage facing them. Perched on Dumbledore's chair. Dressed in a long pink robe. Drinking a cup of tea. As the students wince with pain, she smiles to herself with obvious pleasure. Gritting their teeth, Fred and George glare at her. Cho is standing outside the hall as the students come out. They clutch their sore and painful hands. Hesitantly, Cho approaches the last person to leave. He cuts her dead and walks past. Tearful and forlorn, she gazes after him. Hagrid peers through an archway. The Forbidden Forest. A herd of creatures, half-man, half-horse, gallops past. A young giant looms out of the shadows. He is 10 times bigger than Hagrid. The giant flattens a bird between his huge hands. Gwarp lumbers towards them, knocking Hagrid aside. They back away, but he is restrained by a rope tethered to a tree. He towers over them. Gwarp grabs Hermione. Ron thwacks Gwarp and is knocked over. Hermione looks like a tiny doll in the giant's fist. She wags her finger sternly in his face. Gwarp places her gently on the ground. Ron looks at her anxiously. Gwarp searches through a pile of scrap metal. He chooses a gift for Hermione. Picking up a pair of bicycle handlebars in his colossal fist. He offers them to her. Hermione takes the handlebars from him. Gwarp looks at her expectantly. Hagrid nods encouragement. Hermione rings the rusty bell. Gwarp sits playing with the bell and smiling innocently. Harry sees his parents in a mirror and a reflection of his younger self between them. Snape points his wand. A confusion of happy and terrifying memories flashes through Harry's mind.",
    "1171": "The professors rise to their feet. A Slytherin chaser tosses the Quaffle into the air and fixed it through the goal with his broomstick. Twenty, old. Hovering high above the pitch, Harry is following the game anxiously. Suddenly, the Golden Snitch swoops past. Harry speeds after it, dodging the Bludgers which aimed for his head. His broomstick goes out of control. It shakes him violently from side to side. It spins Harry over and over. Through her binoculars, Hermione spots Snape in the professors' grand stand. His lips are moving. She gives her binoculars to Ron. Harry clings desperately to the bucking broomstick. It spins him off. But he manages to grab the handle and hangs underneath, holding on with only one hand. Malfoy and his cronies cheer. Snape is still muttering to himself. Harry grabs the broomstick with both hands. It swings him backwards and forwards trying to shake him off. Ron watches through the binoculars. Hermione reaches the professors' grand stand and raises up the stairs. Snape is still muttering. She pulls out her wand. Crawling beneath the seats, she gives the wand a flick. She smiles as a flame appears. Snape's cloak starts to burn. The professors beat out the flames, knocking Quirrell off his feet. Harry's broomstick suddenly calms down. Quirrell and Snape put out the fire and watch Harry as he manages to regain control of the Nimbus 2000. He climbs onto the broomstick. He zooms off to the Slytherin seeker, who is close behind the Snitch. They fly shoulder to shoulder. The crafty Slytherin barges Harry, trying to knock him out of the way. Harry circles round, then comes back. The Slytherin bully barges him again. The Snitch flips from tower to tower then suddenly changes his course and heads straight for the ground. The two seekers follow, but the cowardly Slytherin pulls out at the last moment as they plummet down head first. The Snitch levels out, skimming low along the ground. Standing precariously on the broomstick, Harry stretches out his hand to catch the Snitch. He takes a step forward. The broom tips up and sends him somersaulting over onto the grass. He scrambles up, clutching his stomach with both hands. His friends watched with concern. Hagrid peers through the binoculars. Harry spits out the Snitch. As Madam Hooch declares the winner, the Gryffindors leap for joy. Giant Hagrid punches the air victoriously. Hermione shrieks at the top of her voice. Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall applaud enthusiastically. Snape remains in his seat, expressionless. Standing in the middle of the arena, in his Scarlet and gold cloak, Harry beams with pride and pleasure. As his teammates swoop around the arena on their broomsticks, celebrating their success, Harry holds the fluttering Golden Snitch, triumphing above his head and slowly turns, displaying his prize to his ecstatic supporters.",
    "1174": "He puts a huge black egg on the table. The huge egg shudders and twitches and suddenly bursts open. A strange little greeny grey creature uncurls from the broken shell. Its long black leg slips on the surface of the table. It staggers and stretches spiky wings. The dragon shoots flame. Hagrid's beard catches fire. He puts it out with his over gloves. A face at the window. Back in school. Beside Professor McGonagall, Malfoy smirks. Malfoy scowls angrily. Carrying a lantern, Filch leads the four children out of the school. Hagrid comes out of his cottage. Hagrid picks up a crossbow. A shaft of moon light shows the way, follow Hagrid and his dog, Fang, along the edge of the forest. Even the huge giant is dwarfed by the tall trees, which rise up and disappear into the darkness above their heads. Hagrid's lamp throws a feeble beam, as he leads them amongst the trees, deeper and deeper into the dark forest. Twisted branches loom out of the darkness, throwing weird and frightening shadows. Hagrid suddenly stops. He bends down, and dips his fingers into a small pool of silvery liquid. The huge giant looks around wearily. They split up. Malfoy raises the lamp, and he and Harry continue along the path, looking around them cautiously. Fang keeps close beside them, then goes on ahead, his nose to the ground. Suddenly, the big dog stops, and lift his head. The boys catch up with him. A hooded figure is crouching over a large white animal lying on the ground. Harry clutches the scar on his forehead. The hooded figure lifts his head. Followed by Fang, Malfoy turns and runs, still carrying the lamp. In the shadowy moon light, the hooded figure seems to rise up and hover above the dead unicorn. It spreads its arms wide and moves ominously towards Harry. Terrified, he backs away. The figure gets closer and closer. Harry trips over a twisted tree root and falls backwards. He lies helpless on the ground, as the hooded figure advances. Suddenly, something jumps over his head in a flurry of hooves. It attacks the dark figure, who turns and disappears into the mist. Harry scrambles to his feet and looks up at a dark-skinned centaur with a red beard, half man, half horse. Harry nods. As the centaur leaves them, they look sadly at the body of the dead unicorn. The common room. The boys look blank. Harry is not convinced. Crossing the courtyard. Harry sees Hagrid sitting outside his cottage playing a tune. Cloaks flying, they run towards the cottage. They look at each other. The children run back into the school and into Professor McGonagall's classroom.",
    "1179": "In the middle of the night, a stormy sea lashes a small rocky island. Lonely building, a stone hut, Mr. and Mrs. Dursley are fast asleep in a big double bed. In the room below, Dudley is asleep on a sofa while Harry sprawls on the floor in a sleeping bag. He adds some candles and glances at the watch on Dudley's wrist. It's midnight. He blows the candles. A flash of lightning. Dudley wakes with a start. The heavy wooden door shudders. Harry hides in a corner. The Dursleys appear on the stairs. Vernon waves a shotgun nervously. The door falls into the room. A huge figure looms in the doorway. He steps inside, tucking his pink umbrella into his coat. He fits the door back into the frame. Hagrid bends the shotgun barrel. It fires into the rafters. Harry steps forward. He takes a large cake box from his pocket. Hagrid sits down. He points his umbrella at the fireplace and lights the fire. The Dursleys are terrified. Harry puts down the cake and looks at the giant curiously. Hagrid smiles knowingly. He takes out a letter with a wax seal and gives it to Harry. Harry opens the envelope and reads the green writing. Spotting Dudley scuffing Harry's cake, he points his umbrella and gives him a curly pig's tail. The Dursleys shriek with horror. But Harry laughs with delight. He throws open the door. He goes out. Hesitating for only a moment, Harry follows Hagrid out through the door. A busy street in London. Harry reads from a list. Hagrid takes him into the Leaky Cauldron Public House. The Smokey Pub is lit with candles. Harry looks around at the people dressed in old fashioned clothes. The barman spots them. Everyone turns and looks. People shake his hand. A man in the turban. Out in the backyard. He taps his umbrella all around a small metal grill. To Harry's surprise, the bricks in the wall start to move. He stares in amazement as the bricks rearrange themselves to form a doorway. Harry steps through the doorway and into a strange new world. Diagon Alley is a narrow crooked lane hustling with witches and wizards in flowing cloaks and pointed hats. Hagrid towers over them all. They pass tiny shops packed full of fascinating and unusual merchandize. A selection of wizard's cloaks and hats. A pet shop full of owls and cages. An owl sits on a purge outside the shop. A bat stretches its wings above Harry's head. A group of children gaze enviously at a sleek broomstick in a shop window. Harry looks worried. All the clerks in Gringotts Bank are creepy little men with long noses and sharp pointed ears and teeth.",
    "1181": "Harry looks at the solid brick wall. The boy lines up his trolley. He aims his trolley, takes a deep breath, runs straight at the wall, and finds himself safely on the other side. He disappears through the wall followed by his identical twin brother. He pushes his trolley on to Platform 9 and three-quarters. Beside the platform, stands a handsome steam engine. Harry looks on in amazement. Harry smiles with delight. The train steams through the countryside. Harry has a carriage to himself. He sits by the window looking out at the passing scenery. The red haired boy has a smudge of dirt on his nose. Ron's eyes widen. Harry pushes back his hair. Ron holds up a bag of squashed sandwiches. Harry pulls out a handful of gold coins. The boys share the sweets. Harry pulls a face. Harry takes a bean out of his mouth then opens a box marked chocolate frog. The frog jumps. It leaps through the open window. Harry sees a hologram on the card. Harry looks again. A rat. Ron takes out a wand. A girl at the door. She pulls a wand out of her cloak and points it at Harry. His broken spectacles are mended. Harry glances at Ron. On her way out, Hermione looks disapprovingly at Ron. He rubs his nose. The train draws into a small country station. Waiting on the platform is Hagrid, holding a powerful lamp. Wearing black cloaks over their school uniforms, the pupils are dwarfed by the giant Hagrid. Ron gazes up at him in amazement. Hagrid leads the way to the shores of a mysterious pitch-black lake. Four at a time, the children crawl into small, wooden boats. Each softly lit by lamps suspended by a pole. The boats start to move. Half hidden by clouds, the moon casts a faint blue light. Mist rises from the water as the tiny wooden boats drift silently across the lake. In the distance, the children see the turrets and towers of a vast castle perched high on the other side. Light sparkles from hundreds of windows. The children gaze in wonder at the huge imposing building. It towers above them as the fleet of little boats glides closer to the cliff on which it stands. Safely disembarked, the crowd of new students follow each other into the castle and up a wide marble staircase. On the upper landing, long, thin fingers tap the stone balustrade patiently. Standing in front of huge oak doors, the tall figure of Professor McGonagall faces the first-years as they reach the top of the stairs. Neville Longbottom picks up his lost brown toad. He looks up at Professor McGonagall nervously. The little girl smiles at him.",
    "1186": "Behind the shield, a faint light flashes on and off from the bedroom window of a suburban house. The light is flashing from beneath a bed sheet. Harry Potter suddenly emerges from under the sheet and pretends to be asleep. Uncle Vernon, wearing a dressing gown, puts on the light and glares around the room. He switches off the light and goes out. Harry pulls the sheet back over his head. He waves the wand over a spell book. The wand grows brightly. It glows even more brightly. The light flashes again under the sheet. Uncle Vernon looks in again but Harry pretends to be asleep. Harry snuggles down in bed. Daylight. Aunt Marge thrusts a wet umbrella at Harry. She bustles into the sitting room with her bulldog with her. She greets her nephew, Dudley. Harry clears the table. Ripper licks her plate. She gives Ripper brandy and glares at Harry. Uncle Vernon gives Harry a warning look. Her glass shatters. She clicks her fingers at Harry. Harry shakes with rage. Lights start to flash and plates rattle. As Aunt Marge wags her finger at Harry, the tip begins to swell. Her cheeks bulge. Her bottom swells to fill the chair. Ladders appear in her stockings as her legs grow to twice their normal size. The seams on her tweed jacket burst apart. Her neck inflates. The top button of her blouse pings across the room and hits the clock. Vernon and Petunia watch with horror. Dudley goes on eating. Ripper bites Vernon's leg. Aunt Marge rises into the air. The beads of her necklace scatter. She bursts out of the chair. A flying button hits Dudley. A second button knocks him sideways. Marge grabs the tablecloth. She floats even higher and hits the ceiling. Aunt Marge turns upside down showing her bloomers and floats into the conservatory. She bumps against the glass roof. She sails out into the garden. Vernon struggles after her with Ripper clinging to his leg. He grasps her hands. Ripper's still attached. All three are lifted off the ground. Vernon lets go and falls onto the grass. Aunt Marge floats away like a huge balloon. Helplessly, Vernon and Petunia gaze after her. Dudley is still eating and watching television. Harry quickly runs upstairs. Angrily kicking the cupboard. He sits on his bed. He looks at the photograph on the bedside table of his parents dancing happily together. He drags his trunk down the stairs. He points his wand at Vernon. Harry leaves the house dragging his trunk on a small set of wheels. In the distance, Aunt Marge is a faint speck in the darkening sky. Harry walks quickly, breathing hard as he pulls the heavy trunk along the deserted streets.",
    "1194": "Barely visible, a Golden Snitch flutters past. Lightning sets the broomstick of a Gryffindor player on fire. Wearing goggles as protection from the rain, Harry swoops past the stand where the professors follow the action. He keeps close behind the Hufflepuff seeker as they both spot the Golden Snitch. As Diggory reaches out to grab it, lightning catapults him backwards on his broomstick. Harry peers into the hazy clouds. Looming above him, they form the menacing shape of a huge, black dog. He hovers for a moment until the Golden Snitch appears in front of him. He makes a grab for it but it zooms sharply away. Harry swerves back to follow it. As he reaches out, thick ice begins to form on the handle of his broomstick. He shakes his head as his goggles freeze over. An ominous black shape flaps past, a lost umbrella tossed by the ferocious wind. Ghastly figures swirl towards him out of the lowering storm clouds. Harry finds himself surrounded by hooded Dementors. He twists and turns to avoid them. He is catapulted backwards. A Dementor looms over Harry and opens its great mouth as if to suck his energy. Harry loses his grip on the broomstick and falls, helplessly, down through the clouds. Spectators watch in horror as he hurtles towards the ground. Dumbledore uses a spell to break his fall. The hospital wing. Harry opens his eyes. Harry's snowy owl, Hedwig, flies along the valley. The bird approaches the school in a heavy snowstorm and sails past the clock tower. Behind the clock face, Harry looks down as his friends set off without him to visit Hogsmeade. Footprints appear in the snow. The Weasley twins, Fred and George, grab Harry under his invisibility cloak. He taps the blank parchment with his wand. Harry opens the map. The images disappear. A heavy fleck stone slowly rises. Harry finds himself in the cellar at Honeydukes. Wearing his invisibility cloak, he climbs a wooden staircase. Honeydukes' busy sweet shop is full of Hogwarts students choosing confectionary. Neville's red lollipop is snatched from his hand and flips out into the street. Ron and Hermione are close to a shabby house. A snowball hits Malfoy. Another snowball flies out of the forest. Malfoy and his cronies look around for their invisible attacker. One loses his trousers. Another is swung round by his scarf. Malfoy is dragged by his feet towards the Shrieking Shack. Malfoy scrambles to his feet and runs away, followed by his cronies. Harry becomes visible. Ron and Hermione follow his footprints to the pub, but are not allowed inside. Harry looks shocked. He leaves the pub. Hermione sees his footprints. A group of elves are knocked aside.",
    "1198": "A boy walks through a meadow with his dog. A huge dog leaps a fence and heads for the boy, chased by its owner. The newlyweds dangle their feet in a bath and swig champagne from the bottle. Trim and blonde, she takes a swig. Also blonde, with collar length hair, he leans forward and they kiss, as the snow falls outside. The snow is a dense blizzard. Sun blazes down on a motor cruiser riding on the glassy calm waters of a quiet bay. Crystal blue waters wash the shore of a coastal city. Large houses with pools are neatly laid out amid lakes and a golf course. A palatial hotel backs onto the beach. The beach is crowded with sun seekers. Speedboats throw up foaming wakes on the water. A stone bridge crosses a wide river. A red hatchback is among the traffic on the bridge. The couple arrive at an office building. She hustles him out. Jenny's waiting by the car as he leaves the Sun-Sentinel offices. A 4x4 drives down a suburban street. John walks out of a small neat bungalow and picks up the newspapers, one of which is the Sun-Sentinel. The Grogans read their papers over breakfast. It covers most of the next page. She moves uncomfortably to the sink. John frowns and nods. Sebastian packs a knife. John and Jenny drive up a tree-lined path next to a large pen of dogs. Jenny's blindfolded with John's tie. She pets the pups. The Grogans' old hatchback arrives at the airport. The pup's sitting excitedly on the passenger seat. John watches as he paws at the upholstery. The pup stares at him. A police car drives past. John pulls into the driveway. There's a patrol car and people gathered on the street. He gets out of the car, holding the pup. Marley knocks over a big sack of dog foods. Holding a dust pan and broom, John stares at the pup. Splayed out on his belly, Marley is hoovering biscuits. Marley looks up from his box with big sad eyes. John switches off the garage light and goes back into the house. Marley stares pitifully. John brushes his teeth. John switches off the bathroom light and goes to bed, lying with the pillow clamped to his ears. He gets out of bed and goes to the garage. Tousle-headed John picks up the little pup. He leaves the garage with Marley slung over his shoulder. John wakes up in a cloud of feathers with Marley licking his face. The pup's ripped open a pillow and shredded clothes around the bedroom. John heads for the car in the driveway. He closes the garage door. Marley fidgets anxiously in his box.",
    "1199": "As rain lashes the house, Marley jumps up at a window. More lightning flashes. John arrives at the airport in the pouring rain. Jenny comes out of the terminal sheltering under a newspaper. The rain has stopped as they pull into the drive in the old hatchback. Jenny's holding a stuffed alligator. With the alligator under her left arm, she hauls open the garage door and stares at a scene of devastation. Marley spots some pigeons and struggles away from the two bikini girls. Up scatters the birds, hops down the beach full of sun bathers, and runs along the shoreline with John in pursuit. Marley runs straight into the arms of a guy. The guy's dog hurtles to his side. Later, they're back at the house. With one of Jenny's bras in his mouth, Marley charges again. Burst through the screen door, out into the garden. He bolts he back fence as the Grogans give chase, past a neighbor cooking at a barbecue. The neighbor nods. An older Marley drags Jenny through a hedge. She lands in front of another dog owner. John's glumly making notes and screwing them up again. Jenny, with Marley, joins the other trainers. Marley leaps up. Marley wags his tail, then jumps up at John. Marley tries to run off again. She walks off with arrogant confidence. He sprints away and the trainer reaches for a whistle. Dog stops, turns and looks at her, then bounds happily back. Marley knocks the trainer over and starts humping her leg, as John and Jenny rush to help. John stares at Jenny, then shakes his head. Marley lolls out of the window, ears flapping in the breeze as John clutches his hindquarters. The dog's out of the window, walking on his front paws. Jenny gets out to help as traffic streams past. Arnie reads John's copy and shakes his head. Arnie, glasses perched on his nose, screws up his face. John leaves the glass-fronted office with a grin. He walks through the open-plan newsroom, fists clenched in triumph. He sits at his cube workstation and starts to type on his computer. Marley spots another dog and pairs off with the table. Paws on Jenny's shoulders, he's licking her face. He smiles. John, Jenny, and Marley are at the dog beach. It's a tough one, and he grimaces. Grinning, she pats him sympathetically on the back. They tumble, fully clothed, onto their bed, kissing and rolling around. John picks up a pillow and dumps it on the dog's head. Arnie hands John back some copy. John rummages for his phone. Back home, John lets Marley off the leash. He sits on the bed. He feigns enthusiasm. She goes back into the bathroom as John composes himself, then makes another entrance.",
    "12": "She pulls her uniform open and a profusion of red rose petals spill forth. Angela, fully clothed, is once again surrounded by the other girls. The high school band plays its last note, the Dancing Spartanettes strike their final pose, and the audience. Carolyn claps along with the rest of the audience. Lester just sits there, unable to take his eyes off Angela. The game is long over. Jane and Angela come out of the gym. Lester and Carolyn stand at the edge of the parking lot. She crosses reluctantly toward her parents, followed by Angela. An awkward beat. She starts toward the parking lot. Lester stays behind. Angela smiles, aware of the power she has over him. He is mesmerized; grateful, even. Close on a solitary red rose petal as it falls slowly through the air. We're looking down on Lester and Carolyn in bed. Even in sleep, Carolyn looks determined. Lester is awake and stares up at us. The rose petal drifts into view, landing on his pillow. More rose petals fall onto the bed, and he smiles up at. Angela, naked, floats above us as a deluge of rose petals falls around her. Her hair fans out around her head and glows with a subtle, burnished light. She looks down at us with a smile that is all things. Lester smiles back and laughs, as rose petals cover his face. Jane stares at the floor. Jane gets out of the car, still laughing, and waves as Angela pulls away. We zoom toward Jane as she walks up the driveway. She turns suddenly, sensing our presence. We're looking at the colonial house next door where the moving van was parked earlier. The front porch is shrouded in darkness. Then a porch light abruptly reveals Ricky. As usual, he's dressed conservatively. Irritated, Jane stares at him, hard. He looks back at her curiously, then raises his Digicam and starts to videotape her. His POV, on video: Jane, angry and self-conscious, turns and walks quickly toward her house, flipping us off as she goes. Jane enters, closes and locks the door. She quickly turns off the light that's been left on for her, then peeks through a window. And smiles. Jane turns back into the room, her heart racing. Lester, dressed for work, goes through Jane's address book. He grabs Jane's phone and dials, then stands with the receiver to his ear, nervous. Lester is frozen, unable to speak. Lester hangs up and exits quickly. Jane emerges from the bathroom, a towel wrapped around her torso, drying her wet hair. She picks up the phone. Angela is sprawled across her bed, on the phone. Then Jane notices her address book open to the H page.",
    "120": "Only then is it apparent that Phyllis' shot actually did hit him. He looks at the blood on his fingers with a dazed expression and quickly goes out of the room, the way he came. Neff comes out of the house. He closes the front door with his right hand. His left arm hangs limp. He takes a few steps down the walk, then suddenly hears somebody approaching. He moves behind the palm tree near the walk. A man comes up the steps towards the front door -- Zachetti. Just as he reaches the door, Neff calls to him. Zachetti turns and approaches him slowly. He takes some loose change out of his pocket and holds out a coin. Neff starts to drop the nickel into Zachetti's handkerchief pocket. Zachetti knocks his hand away. Zachetti just stares at him. Neff moves again to put the nickel into Zachetti's pocket. This time Zachetti allows him to do it. Zachetti goes slowly past him. Neff grabs him and pushes him almost violently down the walk. Zachetti goes out of shot. The sound of his steps dies away as Neff looks after him. Neff moves off through the shrubbery toward the side of the house where he parked his car. The desk lamp is still lighted. Outside the windows, the dawn is slowly breaking. Neff is still clutching the horn of the dictaphone. He is very weak by now, and his voice holds a note of utter exhaustion. Suddenly he stops his dictation with an instinctive feeling that he is not alone in the room. As he turns in his chair the CAMERA PULLS BACK slowly. The office door is wide open. Keyes is standing a few steps inside it. Behind him, on the balcony outside, stands the night watchman and the colored janitor, peering curiously into the room over Keyes' shoulder. Slowly, and without taking his eyes off Neff's face, Keyes reaches back and pushes the door shut. Neff hangs up the dictaphone horn. He looks at Keyes with a faint, tired grin and speaks very slowly. Keyes moves towards him a few steps and stands without answering. Keyes, staring at him, still does not answer. Neff makes a motion indicating the used cylinders standing on the desk. They stare at each other for a long moment, then, with intense effort Neff gets up on his feet and stands there swaying a little. His face is covered with sweat. His shoulder is bleeding. He is on the verge of collapse. Neff starts to move towards the door, staggering a little, holding himself upright with great effort. Neff has reached the door. He twists the knob and drags the door open. He turns in it to look back at Keyes' implacable face.",
    "1201": "He noses open the plastic bin and tucks in and guzzles water from the toilet. He then trots back into the bedroom and settles himself on his bed, enjoying a scratch before lying down. Heavily pregnant, Jenny stirs in bed. Marley pricks up his ears, then trots to the bedside. She sits up suddenly, clutching her stomach. Marley jumps on the bed and watches as Jenny hurriedly packs some clothes. John lifts the car seat box down from the top of a cupboard. Marley munches open the box. He leaves Marley playing happily with a big chewy bone and hurries out of the house. Marley's still busy with the bone as the sun comes up, and through the day, until the big dog falls asleep on the floor. John arrives home alone. They walk out of the back door onto their wooden decking. John sits wearily on the steps as Marley sniffs around nearby. Jenny's indoors with the baby in a carry seat. Marley jumps up at the table with the baby on it. John gets Marley to sit as Jenny lifts the baby out of the carrier. Marley offers up a welcoming paw. On the pavement, the Grogans' bin is surrounded by chewed empty boxes of baby equipment. John, accompanied by Marley, comes out of the house with another bin bag as the bin men arrive. She jumps to save Marley from the attentions of toddler Patrick. On the beach. John sits with Marley under a palm tree. The big dog sits calmly and watches as a young couple kiss and cuddle on the sand. He notices the dog watching the young couple. He wistfully chews a toothpick as Marley lies down on the sand. In the evening, John and Marley drive up to the house with the headlights on. Marley's looking out of the rear passenger window. From the driver's seat, John looks up and through a window, sees Jenny cuddling Patrick and singing to him. She notices the car, shows Patrick, and waves to her husband, who waves back with a smile. Marley's splayed out on the sofa, watching them. Marley bounds out of the house with John holding his leash. John stops and looks around the night time street. A slim teenage girl is standing by her car in her driveway and clutching her side. She nods tearfully. They drive through a plush neighborhood. He lets Patrick out of his car seat. Marley power slides through the house and into the pool. She's staring into the bathroom mirror. She leads him into the bathroom. There are four positive pregnancy tests in the sink. John half smiles and nods hesitantly. There are golf courses with sand bunkers and most of the houses have pools at the rear.",
    "1214": "A truck of army reinforcements arrives. Rambo gets back on the machine-gun platform. The reinforcements are cut to ribbons in the truck. Rambo fires on the boat. Bullets smash through its windscreen, killing captain and helmsman. A bullet from School Boy decapitates the machine-gunner. On the shore, BN fires a loaded bazooka. The boat is obliterated. Rambo spots the commander escaping up the hill. He leaps down from the machine-gun platform and gives chase. The commander stops, impaled on Rambo's machete. Rambo faces the man. The commander blows out his cheeks and looks up at the big man. Rambo rips the guy's stomach open. The commander drops to the ground and Rambo kicks the man's corpse away with a hefty boot. It rolls away and lies face down. Rambo looks wearily down at the field of battle. From her vantage point with School Boy, Sarah does the same. A couple of straggling troopers scuttle away. Sarah makes her way down the hill. School Boy picks up his hefty weapon and follows her. Rambo also trudges back to the jeep. At the bottom of the hill, rebels buzz about. Smoke billows and some of the foliage is burnt. Sarah looks about her. Rambo lingers at the truck, watching her. Then, he frowns and feels his left shoulder with his right hand, checking his wound. The back of his hand is bloody. Sarah finds Michael crouching over a wounded man. He looks up. She runs to him and flings her arms around him. He has a wound to his forehead, and his face is black with soot and grime. Rambo watches them. Sarah and Michael embrace for a few moments, then he gently pushes her arms away and strokes her hair. He then returns to the wounded man. School Boy kneels over Lewis, and Reese over En-Joo's corpse. Sarah looks up the hill at Rambo. Her face is grimy, and she has a light cut across her forehead. She looks at School Boy, who stares down at Lewis. Lewis stirs a little. She looks at the corpse of one of the volunteers, who has bullet wounds in his chest. Michael looks up the hill and sees Rambo. Wide-eyed and frowning, he raises a hand to Rambo. Sarah's face crumples and she starts to weep. Rambo turns away, clutching his shoulder. John Rambo walks along a lonely road halfway up a hill in Arizona, U.S.A. The hill is decorated with scrubby green grass. Utility poles stretch along the length of the road. Rambo's hair is neatly brushed and his face clean. He wears a pair of dark boots, blue denims and a khaki parka over a black T-shirt. There is a khaki kit bag slung over one shoulder.",
    "1217": "There is light on the riverbank. Michael's party stirs. Lights hang from the soffit of a dock house on the distant riverside. Michael, Sarah and the party crouch low in the boat as it nears the building. A group of the pirates sit on a veranda overlooking the river. The volunteers wear worried frowns. The boat's passage past the pirates appears to go unnoticed in the dark. Michael glances worriedly at Rambo. Rambo's gaze does not waver from the pirates as the boat leaves the pirate dock behind. The volunteers move up the boat en masse towards Rambo. Michael steps up to him. A floodlight from a motorboat. A warning shot and the boat bears down on them. The pirates are armed with a machine gun on a tripod. Sarah pulls on a white floppy hat. Rambo stands with his arms raised in surrender. Pirate motorboat pulls alongside them. Pirates in vests and bandannas cast ropes with grappling hooks tied to the ends over to Rambo's boat. The hooks catch and lock. A floodlight plays on Rambo's face. A pirate brandishes a pistol. Rambo throws a switch and the lights go on. He turns the gun on Sarah. The pirate leader turns his gun back on Rambo. Rambo sees a pistol tucked into the second pirate's waistband. He pulls a gun from his pocket and shoots them. The pirates drop to the deck of their boat in slow motion. One of them is only wounded. He reaches for his gun. Rambo stands on his hand and aims at him. Rambo shoots him in the head and turfs the corpse overboard. He grabs Michael by the throat. He releases Michael and throws a grappling hook over the side. He and Sarah grab the tiller. She stares at him desperately. She places her slim hand on his beefy forearm. Her eyes are wide and brimming with tears. Michael looks away, disgustedly. She rejoins the group. They appear very subdued. She sits next to Michael, who holds her in his arms. With a sullen glare, Rambo fires up the boat's motor and adjusts the tiller. The boat plows through the river water. The floodlights of the now derelict pirate boat touches their departing stand, as the boat motors into the inky blackness. A bright sunny day. The boat is steered towards a riverbank. There is a simple harbor beneath a large, spreading tree which overhangs the water. The volunteers stand up in the boat, collect their belongings and begin to disembark. Local peasants act as porters nearby. Rambo watches the volunteers leave. The last of them are Michael and Sarah. Michael rounds on Rambo. Michael gets off the boat and walks away up a wooden gangplank.",
    "1218": "Sarah lingers and turns to Rambo. Her blonde hair is tied back in a bunch. On the riverside, Michael pauses and watches them. He carries a small bundle. Rambo wears a concerned frown. Sarah stares at him sadly. She smiles faintly and places a small crucifix on a necklace into his enormous hand. His fingers close over the gift. She stares at him, then turns away. She gets off the boat. On the bank, Michael hoists a bulky black rucksack onto his shoulders. Sarah walks up the gangplank. She joins Michael. The party march away with the peasant porters. Michael's party march inland over the head of a waterfall. Two of the bearers carry a pole between them, from which a large carton hangs. Rambo's boat wends its way back down the river. Michael's party crosses a static body of water bordered by rocks and boulders. A man at the front of the party uses a camcorder. Rambo's boat rounds a headland and comes upon the pirates' motorboat, floating near a bank. Rambo stares warily at it as they past. A single corpse lies on the deck near the abandoned machine gun. Rambo grips the tiller firmly and guides his boat towards the pirate boat. The volunteers and bearers traipse over the brow of a hill. In the valley below is a settlement overlooking a paddy field. Sarah looks about. Rambo pilots the pirate boat further up the river. His own follows behind it, piloted by one of his men. On the pirate boat, one of the pirate corpses has turned a mottled purple. The boat moves into a riverbank. Rambo locks off the motor and brings the pirate boat to a halt. He grabs petrol cans and rope and makes his way through the pirate corpses. The volunteers approach the village. They're greeted by small children and adults alike. The village huts are built in the local style in wood with high foundations. Rambo flips the top of one of the cans, holds it above his head and drenches the machine gun and pirate corpses with petrol. The villagers make Michael's party welcome. Rambo opens up another can and drowns the deck in more petrol. The petrol washes pools of blood over the side of the boat. He throws an empty can into the hold of the boat. He flips open and lights a cigarette lighter. From his own boat, he tosses the lighter into the pirate boat, which bursts into flame. Stalks of rice plants stand upright in a paddy field below the village. Outside a hut, Sarah hands a book to a puzzled child. One of the volunteers gives an oral examination to a woman. An old man plays a stringed instrument.",
    "1223": "A bright white light shines out from the center of a black screen. The screen lightens to reveal clouds and a blue sky. The light is held aloft by a statuesque woman wearing a long, white robe with a blue sash draped around her. She stands on a raised plinth before the cloudy sky. An orange disc surrounded by black revolves like a record on a turntable. Shafts of light gradually form the shape of a running man. The figure becomes smaller and is frozen in the iris of an intensely blue eye. The image fades to black. A handsome black guy holds a receiver to his ear. He covers his eyes with his hand. He rocks back and forth. He removes his hand from his face. The silhouette of the man swims the crawl on the surface. Sun glints on the surface of the water. The man swims to shore, and strides onto the beach. The man, tall, lean and in his 30s, walks up steps from the beach which cut through a garden, abundant with colorful flowers and bushes. A long low beach house with white flowers trailing from part of its roof looks out over a patio, the garden and the ocean. In the house, the man studies himself solemnly in a mirror as he fastens his tie. The man sits pensively on his sofa. Before him on a coffee table is a list of names with a typed note attached to it. The name Ezra Turner has been encircled on the list. In a call center cubicle, a man wearing a headset sits at a computer. Ezra types on a braille keyboard. Ezra disconnects the call. Ben slams the phone down. Looking disturbed by his own actions, Ben claps his hands to his mouth and stares down. He blinks, composes himself and lowers his hands. Pacing, Ben stabs the air with a finger each time he calls out a name. Ben smashes a chair against a coffee table. A list of names scrolls. A rapid montage of items -- a newspaper article, a coast road, snapshots of Ben, Sarah Jenson's funeral card. A deserted open plan office in shadowy light. A cleaner polishes a floor in a brightly lit corridor. Ben sits in a cubicle, typing on a keyboard. He stares at his computer monitor gravely. The name, Emily Posa, has been encircled on his list beside him. Above it, the name Yvonne Bastidos has been crossed out. Ben stares pensively at the details, which include a photo of attractive, dark-haired Emily. He prints out her details. Traffic glides along a sunny freeway. Ben stares ahead gravely as he drives. On the seat beside him is a file with Emily Posa's details attached to it.",
    "1224": "Ben takes a key from behind an upper hinge of the workshop door and glances over his shoulder at Duke, who sits nearby watching him. Ben unlocks the padlock. Duke follows him into the workshop. He flicks a switch on it. Ben gets tools out of his bag. Ben sets to work on the machine. Stripped down to his vest, lithe, muscular Ben hammers a pin out of the machine. He undoes a huge knot with an equally huge monkey wrench and fits a new belt on the flywheel. Duke lies snoozing nearby, as Ben reassembles the machine. Ben leaves the workshop with Duke, who escorts him down the side of the house to the gate. Ben gets in his car and drives off. Ben takes a shower at the motel. Looking troubled once more, he stands beneath the fine jets of water and stares down deep in thought. Flashbacks of Ben running through the night. Ben's face is bloody in the flashback. He stops running and sinks to his haunches. In his motel, Ben sits on the edge of the bath, staring down. He's bare chested and has a white towel wrapped around his waist. A flashback of a bloodied garment. And an inert, blood-smeared hand lying on earth. A dream-like image of Sarah. She's wearing a pink dress, then smiling gently as she looks down at something. She walks away slowly from Ben's motel room bed and out of sight. Ben, dressed, lies on his back on the bed. Ben watches the bald boy, Nick, through a window. Nick looks weak and is attached to monitors. His mother is reading to him while a nurse fills in a chart beside them. Ben is lying face down on an examination table. The doctor uses a large syringe. Ben buries his face in a pillow as the doctor extracts the bone marrow from his hip. Later, Ben limps slowly into the motel, where Larry is watering plants. Ben ignores him. Ben enters his room. Ben lies on his side in the motel room bed. An unfinished plate of food sits on the covers, along with documents and handwritten letters. Ben ignores his phone. Ben's face is now stubbly. He's sitting up in bed, staring ahead somberly. Ben lies asleep on his side. His mobile flashes as it rings. Ben's eyes open slowly. He stares at the mobile, which lies beside him on the bed. He hesitates before picking it up, then checks the display and opens the clamshell phone. He puts the phone to his ear. She cringes and looks hopeful. Emily breaks into an uncertain smile. She smiles and puts down the phone. The home nurse gives Emily a questioning look.",
    "1227": "The scene fades to black. In the garden, rain bounces off the abandoned dinner table where droplets plop into half-empty glasses of white wine. A candle flame flickers in a struggle to stay alight. Emily and Tim lie in each other's arms in bed. They caress each other's faces. She stares into his eyes. Tim strokes her arm as he stares into her adoring eyes. Emily plays gently with his ear, then lowers her eyes and lightly touches his lips with her fingertips. Emily stares at him earnestly. Emily looks tearful and puts her lips to his shoulder. A large tear rolls down Emily's nose. Tim hugs her to him. She buries her face in his chest. They kiss. The pulse in Emily's neck jumps rhythmically. Golden light bathes her face as she lies sleeping peacefully. Tim lies beside Emily, watching her closely. Emily's hand rests palm-up on the empty pillow beside her. She twitches slightly but doesn't wake. The scar on the upper part of her left breast shows just above the sheet. Tim, now dressed in his jeans, stands at her bedside and pulls on his polo shirt. Looking troubled, he stares down at Emily. Tim leaves the house by the French windows. He sets off slowly across the dark garden in the pouring rain, then jogs to the picket fence. He jumps over it. Tim runs frantically down a street of shops, some of which have neon-lit signs. Soaked to the skin, Tim bursts into a hospital corridor and strides down it to the nurses' station. The nurse eyes Tim warily. Looking fraught and agitated, Tim turns away from the nurses' station, paces a little and sits down on a chair beside a water cooler. He stares at the floor. Tim looks up when Dr. Briar enters the corridor and walks to meet her. She looks alarmed. Tim raises a hand helplessly, marches back along the corridor and pushes through the double doors. The hospital's main doors slide open. Tim walks out into the night. The rain cascades as a grief-stricken Tim strides away from the hospital. As he walks, he takes his mobile phone from his jeans' pocket and taps in a number. Dan and Michelle lie asleep in each other's arms. Dan reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet. Tim rings off. Dan, now sitting up in bed, remains with the phone to his ear and drops his head. Tim returns to his motel room and pauses in the doorway. His expression is slightly glazed, as if consumed by his own sad thoughts. He turns and stares outside, then closes the door. Tim sits on the edge of his bed, panting. Regaining his composure slightly, Tim reaches for the phone on his bedside cabinet and makes a call.",
    "1228": "Ezra is woken by the ringing. He presses a button on a digital clock beside his bed. He picks up the phone. Tim hangs up. Ezra, now sitting on the side of his bed in shadowy light, lowers the phone slowly from his ear and swallows hard. In the motel, Tim pulls a large bag of ice from the freezer. He slits it open, dumps it into the bathtub, and turns on the shower. He checks his watch, which is on the side of the bath, then makes a call. Tim covers his face with his hand and nods as he weeps. Tim rocks back and forth. Sarah admires her engagement ring. As Tim emails a response to the message he received, the Corvette wanders into the opposite lane, narrowly missing an oncoming car. The Corvette spins and collides with a van full of people. The van flips several times, throwing its passengers about like rag dolls. The Corvette Tim was driving bounces and rolls down a steep embankment. The Corvette comes to rest as a mangled heap among bushes. In his motel room, Tim steps gingerly into the bathtub of iced water. He's wearing the jeans and polo shirt. He slowly lowers himself into the tub. He's left a note on the floor beside the tub. Tim recalls a blissful-looking Emily lying in bed with him and stroking his face. He surfaces from the memory and reaches for a plastic bucket on the side of the bath. He pours the contents into the water. The box jellyfish glides through the water and up to Tim's hand. It languidly wraps its tentacles around his forearm and stings him. Tim jolts. His body instantly goes into shock from the poison. As he spasms, he grabs hold of the shower curtain around the bath. Tim's legs kick. A flashback to the accident. Tim hurriedly staggers through undergrowth. He tears up the shower curtain, bringing it and the rail down on himself. Another flashback. Tim lurches toward Sarah, who's been thrown from the car and lies on the dark road. He crouches beside her. Tim's spasms begin to subside. In a flashback, he reaches out to touch Sarah's inert, bloody hand. He lies on the road, cuddling her and weeping. In the motel, Tim lies on his back in the tub. His chin sinks to his chest. In a hospital, medics try to resuscitate Tim. Dan is in deep conversation with an official. Emily's pager wakes her. Lying on her stomach, she reaches out for the pager, then raises herself a little to look at it. Suddenly noticing the empty space beside her in the bed, she sits up and scans about. In an operating room, Tim's body is lifted onto a table.",
    "1231": "Ben gets out of his car and admires a shiny BMW convertible parked beside him. Elderly ladies, one on a Zimmer, shuffle down a corridor. Ben passes them as he strides towards the reception window, which is open, and shows IRS ID. A suited man sits on the edge of Inez's bed. Inez reaches for a pad. But he grabs her wrist, then is aware of Ben. She shuns his touch. Inez ignores him. He goes to Ben. Goodman looks awkward and leans forward. Ben stares at him impassively. Ben nods and cocks his head to one side as he continues staring at Goodman. He straightens up again, smiles faintly and picks up his briefcase. Ben's lip curls disdainfully as they shake hands. Ben enters Inez's room. Frail and white-haired, Inez is lying in bed. She ignores him and merely sighs. Ben gives a kindly smile. She stares ahead, stony-faced. Ben puts his briefcase on the floor. He moves gingerly to a chair and turns it towards her bed. Ben sits down at Inez's bedside. She continues staring vacantly ahead. Inez shifts slightly. Inez, who has straggly hair, remains blank. Inez turns her head slowly to look at Ben. He smiles gently. Inez's face is heavily lined. She stares at Ben pensively, then turns stiffly and reaches out a bony hand to pick up her writing pad and pen from a surface nearby. Inez studies Ben once more, then begins to write something down. He watches. Inez nods and writes some more. Inez looks at Ben wearily. Her bottom lip quivers. She looks away. A tearful Inez glances at Ben, who gives her an encouraging little smile. Inez begins to write again. As Ben reads her words, his brow furrows. He looks dismayed. Inez's face crumples. She weeps. Ben looks deeply moved and raises his clasped hands to his mouth. He hurriedly carries Inez out of the room, and puts her into a wheelchair and wheels her past reception. Ben is in his face. Ben pushes Goodman's head back against a window and marches out. A sunny golf course. A woman in a short, white skirt and a T-shirt gets out of a golf buggy with a guy in chinos and a polo shirt. They walk to a ball. Ben approaches them. They hug. Michelle moves away. Ben looks him in the eye and shakes his head. A network of freeway flyovers in sunshine. Ben drives his saloon. In a hospital canteen, an elderly patient attached to a drip wheels the stand it's on as he walks. Most of the tables, which have vases of yellow flowers on them, are occupied. Ben sits at a table, reading. He looks up from his book and watches a woman with two young boys who are drawing at a table nearby.",
    "1232": "One boy is bald. He's wearing a dressing gown and pajamas. The boy spots Ben, who smiles and nods, then returns briefly to reading. Ben takes a paper cup and sucks on the straw in it, all the while observing the boys and the woman. The woman smiles as she watches the boys. The bald boy glances across at Ben, but looks down again shyly. Behind the boys, in Ben's line of sight, Emily sits at a table by a window. Ben resumes reading. Emily, wearing a short strappy dress over a vest top, approaches Ben's table and glances over at the shaven-headed boy before speaking. He gets out his ID. Ben smiles. Ben puts her files back in his briefcase and leaves with a polite smile. Emily remains sitting at the table. Looking drained, she stares down dejectedly. A blue and white neon sign for the Travel Inn glows in the night. Ben pulls up in his saloon outside the slightly seedy-looking motel. He gets out of the car and goes to the reception window. Ben goes to look through an open door. A pudgy bearded guy spots him and comes out from behind a lacy curtain. Ben returns to the reception window where the guy now greets him. Ben lets himself into a dark room and carries in his cases. He puts his keys on a table and shuts the door. Ben sits on his bed in dim lamp light and takes a book and a file out of his bag. The file appears to be full of newspaper cuttings. Ben opens it and studies the first cutting intently. Beneath, the photos of the seven people killed. Ben watches an ice hockey practice. Two players collide, then fight. Emily puts the phone down. She scans about the room. Emily opens French windows and goes outside. Looking shocked, Emily goes around the side of the house to find Ben feeding Duke. Duke pulls her. Duke pulls. Duke keeps pulling Ben. Emily gets a container out of her fridge. Ben studies documents. Emily looks astonished and stares at him, brow furrowed. He stares down at the table they're sitting at. She fiddles with her collar. He smiles good-humoredly and considers. Once again, Emily looks astounded. Ben grins and looks down. Taken aback, Emily blinks as the decision sinks in. Ben gets up. They share a lingering look. Ben smiles broadly and heads out. Emily ponders. He turns back. Emily walks up to him. He stares at her with sad, gentle eyes. He raises his eyebrows, then looks serious. She stares at Ben and blinks. Ben gives an awkward, white-toothed grin and makes for the front door. They hold each other's gaze.",
    "1233": "Emily smiles and looks down shyly. Ben shuffles. She gives a little wave as Ben steps outside. Ben shoots Emily a last look before shutting the door behind him. Ben goes to his car. Emily watches him through the window. Ben stands, looking out from his patio. Breakers crash on the beach where Sarah waves up to Ben. Tears roll down Ben's cheeks as he stands looking out to sea. Ben sits on rocks. Ben opens shutters in his beach house. Ben fingers a rope of pearls and studies a photo of himself and Sarah. Ben cleans his beach house. Ben sits glumly among a stack of packed boxes in the beach house. Ben drives his car sedately along the wide and winding coast road, which is bathed in sunshine. The motel receptionist, Larry, helps Ben carry gear. In his motel room, Ben uses a small hose to fill up the large cylindrical fish tank that Larry was carrying. Light from the tank illuminates Ben's face as he stands in the darkness, seemingly lost in thought. Ben, as a boy, at an aquarium. Ben gazes in awe into a tank of jellyfish with spindly, long tentacles. The jellyfish move hypnotically in the water. The glowing specter-like creatures drift through the water. Ben the boy watches spellbound, the palms of his hands pressed against the tank. Michelle's husband, Dan, watches a box jellyfish in adult Ben's tank. Ben is writing. Ben signs a document. Ben throws a notebook at Dan. Ben taps his own temple. Dan's expression darkens. Dan edgily wipes his mouth, then his eyes. He glares at Ben and falters, before he starts to speak. Dan paces the motel room tearfully. Ben enters a crowded waiting room full of women and children. He stands and stares across at a bespectacled middle-aged woman, who is sitting in a glass-fronted office. Her mouth drops open when she sees Ben. He waves to her and smiles. The woman hurries out to him. Holly hugs him tightly, then steps back. Holly keeps a photo of herself and Ben on her desk in the open-plan office. He sits with her. Holly's eyes glisten with tears as she stares at him. He eyes her steadily and smiles faintly. She considers, then looks at him reassuringly. A dilapidated area. Ben sits in his car, watching a house. Connie is cleaning a window of the house. Ben approaches the window and smiles in at Connie, who opens the front door but not the wrought iron screen door. Connie lets Ben in. A little boy of about eight and a slightly older girl are in the living room, playing cards and listening. Ben sits down. The children listen as they play.",
    "1234": "He nods towards her ribs. She hurries to the children. She escorts them out to their room, then returns. Connie looks petrified. She slams the door on Ben and locks it. Ben pauses outside, facing the door dejectedly. After a moment, he leaves the modest clapboard house. Ben cuts off his brother. In his motel bathroom, Ben lies fully clothed in a bath that is too short for him. He tries to wriggle down, but his head remains well above the level of the bath. Emily is at home working at her kitchen table. Documents are stacked on the small table. Emily is making notes. She studies her pad thoughtfully, checks a document, then searches through more documents. She scribbles a number out on her pad and encircles another number. Looking down forlornly at the documents before her, Emily sighs and opens her Filofax. She takes out Ben's business card and studies it. A doctor in a white coat enters a hospital ward. He approaches the ice hockey coach and Ben. The doctor goes to Ben. He shakes Ben's hand and leaves. George returns Ben's kindly stare with a slight smile. In another hospital room, Ben makes a call on his mobile. Emily is drying up in her kitchen. Ben holds his mobile to his ear. Ben stands looking distraught, then closes his mobile. Ben sits in deep, gloomy thought. A nurse comes to get him. She goes. Ben stares down gravely. Ben raises his eyes and stares ahead, his face etched with anguish as he remembers. A man and a woman's hand in bright light. Their fingers entwined and they caress each other's skin. Lying in bed, beautiful dark-haired Sarah smiles up at Ben beside her. Metal debris spins and scatters in slow motion. A woman is tossed about. A van flips on a dark road. Ben comes to on his motel bed. He's lying on his stomach and looks woozy. A hand comes from behind him and gently strokes his cheek. The figure of a dream-like Sarah gradually lies back down. Ben is alone in bed. His mouth hangs open loosely. His eyes blink sleepily. Emily's neighbor is gardening when Emily walks up to her with Duke on a lead. Emily walks on slowly past her neighbor's profusion of colorful roses and begins to fight for breath. Emily looks faint. Duke bounds into Emily's garden. Emily blinks, and walks towards her steps. Emily falls flat on her face on the path. She's motionless. Her eyes are closed. Ezra Turner uses a long, white stick to feel his way down a wide and long flight of stairs. Out on the street, Ezra feels his way along the pavements with the stick held out in front of him.",
    "1236": "Ben stirs. He sits up. A doctor enters. Dr. Briar sits on Emily's bed. Emily nods. She hands Emily the pager. Emily takes a deep breath and looks down. Dr. Briar strokes Emily's hair, gives her a reassuring smile and leaves. Tears roll down Emily's cheeks as she puts a hand to her mouth. She takes his hand. Ben looks on sorrowfully as Emily presses the back of his hand against her forehead and weeps. Ben walks Duke on a lead past the Travel Inn reception. Larry sees and comes out after them. Ben enters his room. Long-haired Larry is left outside, looking indignant. A small fish swims up into the tentacles of the box jellyfish in Ben's aquarium. The fish is immediately partially paralyzed and drawn up towards the body of the jellyfish. Ben sits on his motel bed, watching, and slowly reaches for his mobile beside him. Connie's face is bruised. Ben hands her an envelope. Connie does. She nods. They're asleep in the back of her car. A calm Connie drives along the coast road with the children still asleep in the back of the car. She heads down the leafy drive to Ben's beach house, pulls up and looks awestruck. Connie tentatively enters the house with the children. They stand in the doorway for a moment, then the girl sets off to look about. Connie pulls her back. The kids run to a window to look out. Connie and the kids enter a bedroom and look about in wonder. They all jump up and down on the bed. Mother and children run along the deserted, sunny beach. In the house, curtains sway in the breeze as Connie sits reading a letter. Connie, her long, dark hair tied back, considers. Looking overwhelmed, Connie puts her hands to her mouth. Connie holds a pen. Her hand hovers over a document, then she signs it. Connie looks out over the ocean. Connie is silhouetted against hazy, golden light. Ben escorts Emily, as a nurse pushes her out of the hospital in a wheelchair. They go to his car and he opens the door for Emily to get in. Duke's in the back. He fastens her seat belt. Emily grins. He stares ahead. She gazes at him and smiles, then lightly nibbles her nails. Ben pulls up and turns to her awkwardly. Ben's eyes dart about as he thinks. He eyes her firmly. She stares at him and looks puzzled. Emily studies him through slightly narrowed eyes. She stares at him expectantly, opens her eyes wide and furrows her brows. Ben meets her gaze blankly. Emily looks down, considers, then undoes her seat belt. She shoots him a disdainful look and gets out.",
    "124": "Neff sits in the swivel chair, talking into the dictaphone. He has hooked the wastebasket under his feet to sit more comfortably. Camera moves slowly towards the davenport again. Neff sits in one corner with his feet on the low table. He is smoking his cigarette and staring at the ceiling. Phyllis has been sitting fairly close to him. She gets up slowly and crosses to her rain coat, lying over a chair. Neff still does not answer. He looks at her slowly, almost absently. He gets up and grips her arm. His fingers dig into her arm. He kisses her. They have now reached the door. Neff opens it. Phyllis stands in the doorway, her lips white. She goes quietly. He watches her down the corridor. Slowly he closes the door and goes back into the room. He moves across the window and opens it wide. He stands there, looking down into the dark street. The rain drifts in against his face. He just stands there motionless. Neff sits slumped in his chair before the dictaphone. On the desk next to him stands a used record. The checker-board is on the davenport between Phyllis and Lola. Mr. Dietrichson sits in a big easy chair. His coat and tie are over the back of the chair, and the evening paper is lying tumbled on the floor beside him. He has a drink in front of him and several more inside him. In another chair sits Neff, his briefcase on the floor, leaning against his chair. He holds his rate book partly open, with a finger in it for a marker. Phyllis looks up from the checker-board and cuts in on the dialogue. Lola listens without much interest. As she looks back she sees that Lola is staring down at her wrist watch. She gets up. She starts to go. Dietrichson sucks down a big swallow of his drink. Neff has taken two blank forms from his briefcase. Phyllis is watching closely. Neff takes out his fountain pen. Neff has unscrewed his fountain pen. He hands it to Mr. Dietrichson. Dietrichson puts on his glasses. He withdraws the top copy barely enough to expose the signature line on the supposed duplicate. Dietrichson grunts and signs again. Again Neff and Phyllis exchange a quick glance. Casually Neff lifts the briefcase and signed applications off Dietrichson's lap. Dietrichson has poured some more whisky into his glass. He tries the siphon but it is empty. He gathers up his coat and tie and picks up his glass. Neff is zipping up his briefcase. Dietrichson trundles off towards the archway. Phyllis leads the way and Neff goes after her, his briefcase under his arm. Phyllis enters through the living room archway with Neff behind her.",
    "1248": "She follows their instructions and stashes the dry cleaning in the closet on the left. She shows the book. They giggle as Andy creeps upstairs. She reaches an upper floor, and comes across Miranda and her husband. They catch sight of Andy who's trying to creep back downstairs. Miranda glowers at Andy, who's like a rabbit trapped in the headlights. She leaves the book on the top step, and hurries away. Emily grabs Andy's arm, and pulls her into a side room as she arrives for work. Emily points to Miranda's office, and Andy reluctantly goes in there. Andy smiles nervously, and heads back to her desk. Miranda answers her mobile. Andy sets a tray down on Miranda's desk, and sprinkles herbs onto Miranda's steak. Emily runs to fetch them. Emily has Miranda's coat and bag for her as she leaves. Andy carries the dishes into a side room, and throws them into the sink. She calls Nate. Andy stands on the corner for a moment, in a dark green dress and gold accessories, then runs across the busy street. She runs around the corner and races up to the St. Regis, where a doorman in a morning suit greets her. She finds Christian sitting at the bar. She takes the manuscript. At the appointed hour, she puts a hot coffee and the manuscript down on Miranda's desk. The twins are reading them. Miranda turns away in her swivel chair and Andy walks out with a smile. Once Andy's gone, Miranda turns back to stare after her and snatches up the coffee. Nate gets home to find Andy painting a ball to look like a planet. She hugs him. He shakes his head. A black camisole. He pulls her into a passionate embrace. Nigel and his team are on a shoot by a lake in Central Park. The models are all in animal print outfits and stylized animal masks. There's a man with a live snake. Andy finds Nigel vetting one of the models. He leaves Andy thoughtful. Miranda's in a meeting with her senior members of staff, including Nigel. Emily has a cold. She comes in, hands something to Miranda and goes. Emily goes back to her desk. Mouth shut. Andy is on her way out of the building when her phone goes. She's back in Miranda's office with Emily. Andy nods. Albums. Nigel has a long black gown. City lights sparkle as Andy is driven to the benefit. Andy gets out of the car looking stunning in a chic black evening gown, with her hair swept up and adorned with white flowers. Andy spots Nigel talking to reporters. He spots Andy and gives her a warm smile. She winks back and makes her way back past the press, along the red carpet and up the stairs and towards the entrance.",
    "1250": "She stands and stares at Andy with a vaguely pleased smile. Andy nods and holds her hand out to receive the coat, but Miranda tosses it and her handbag onto Emily's desk and marches into her office. Andy stares at the coat, which has been slung over Emily's monitor screen and sits stiffly down in her own chair. Miranda comes to the door. Andy reluctantly picks up her telephone receiver and calls Emily who's running down busy streets with some big bags. Emily is hit by a taxi and rolls onto its bonnet. The scarves flutter around her. Andy waits at the hospital, looking sheepish. Later she's with Emily, who's lying in bed with a broken leg and some cuts and bruises. A man comes in with a dinner tray. Emily tucks into a jelly pot and some bread. Andy stands up and grabs her clutch bag. Andy's at a gallery show that Lily's curated. Lily leads Doug off and Andy checks out the art, standing alone to admire the floor-to-ceiling, blown-up black-and-white photographs of street scenes. Christian is at the opening too. He spots Andy. Andy closes her eyes as rugged, fair-haired Christian kisses her cheek before leaving. Lily is seeing the kiss from across the room and walks off angrily. Andy tries to catch up. Nate follows Andy out. He stares at Andy, who gazes back then glances aside. Nate nods, then turns and walks away. He turns back. Nate walks off. Swallowing her tears, Andy takes the call. An aerial view of Paris by night. The Eiffel Tower alive with sparkling lights. Andy is sitting in the back of a chic, chauffeur-driven car as they travel through the Paris streets and among the Champs elysees. She gazes out off the window, wide-eyed with excitement as they pass the city's grand buildings, shops, and hotels and the imposing Arc de Triomphe. Miranda occasionally glances over her spectacles at the view. Andy is sitting behind Nigel and Miranda, who are in the front row for the Valentino show. Models in an array of stunning gowns sashay down the runway as cameras flash. Nigel whispers in Miranda's ear. Andy's in the second row for another show and leans forward in her seat, as the models parade up and down in flamboyant evening gowns. Now, Andy's at the Azzaro show, where dresses in a monochrome palette are being shown. Models and celebrities mingle backstage at the Valentino Show. Miranda talks to Valentino. Andy follows Miranda and Nigel as they head into another function past the press pack. Miranda poses for photos. Christian is close beside Andy as a TV journalist collars Nigel and Miranda. They're photographed. Andy hurries after Miranda. Later, Andy enters Miranda's suite carrying some boxes.",
    "1254": "A guy walks onto the stage. He's around 60 and tanned with white hair. He smiles at his adoring fans. Even Carl smiles and claps. Carl holds up his hand expectantly and then nods knowingly. Everyone else claps. He glances around. A spotlight picks Carl out. Carl smiles awkwardly. The audience points at him. Terrance slips off his shoes and sprints down the aisle. He reaches Carl and grabs a chair. He sits facing Carl. Someone gives him a mic. Nick waves. Carl takes a sharp breath. He presses the mic against Carl's nose. Terrance lowers the mic and edges closer to Carl, who inches backwards. He hits Carl with the mic. Carl furrows his brow. Transfixed, Carl stares at him. Terrance stands and yanks him up. Terrance throws Carl down. Nick catches him. His eyes bulging, Terrance raises his arms in the air victoriously. He strides back down the aisle towards the stage. Carl laughs and cries alternately. He claps with the rest of the crowd. Terrance stands on the stage and raises his arms. Some of the audience stand. Nick puts his fingers in his mouth to whistle. Carl and Nick amble along outside the conference venue. A guy smiles at Carl. Carl grins and Nick heads off. Carl frowns. Carl and the vagrant guy get into Carl's car. By the door. Carl stares ahead pensively. He takes his phone out and hands it to the guy. Nick gives Carl the thumbs up and slams the car door shut. The vagrant dials on Carl's phone. They drive up a dark road into Elysian Park. The guy's on Carl's phone. Carl smiles wryly. He pulls up beside some trees. Carl takes his phone back. His brow creased, Carl reaches into his pocket. He smiles. He pulls out some bank notes. He offers the guy all his money. The guy has to yank it out of Carl's hand. Carl smiles and waggles his finger. The guy jogs off and dives through a hedge at the side of the road. Carl nods pensively, then reverses his car. He turns the car around. It splutters and stalls. Carl's walking. Carl jogs along a dark road through the park. Carrying a jerrycan, he reaches a garage. He glances over at the garage shop, which is closed. He saunters over to a pump and swipes a card in it. He takes it out and rubs it on his arm agitatedly. He swipes again. It asks if he wants credit. A scooter careers down the road and turns into the garage. Carl turns to look at the pretty dark-haired woman on the scooter. She gets off and undoes the strap on her blue helmet that has eyes painted on it.",
    "126": "She snaps the bag shut. He breaks off as a short, squatty woman, pushing a child in a walker, comes into sight and approaches. She stops beside Neff, who is pretending to read a label on a can. Phyllis puts a few cakes of soap into her basket. She nods. Neff reaches a can down from the high shelf and hands it to her. She moves away with her coffee and her child. Out of the corner of his eye Neff watches her go. He moves closer to Phyllis again. He goes off. She stares after him. He is wearing a light grey suit and has his hat on. He is standing behind his desk opening some mail, taking a few papers out of his briefcase, checking something in his rate book, making a quick telephone call. Keyes enters with some papers in his hand. The telephone rings on Neff's desk. Automatically Keyes grabs the phone and answers. Neff picks the phone up and answers. Phyllis is on the phone. Neff on the phone. His eye catches Keyes', who is walking up and down. He speaks into the phone as calmly as possible. Neff on phone. He covers the receiver with his hand and turns to Keyes, who is now standing at the window. He makes a gesture as if expecting Keyes to leave. Keyes stays right where he is. Neff looks at Keyes' back with a strained expression, then lifts the phone again. Neff on the phone. Neff gets up from his desk. He punches his stomach with his fist. Keyes nods slowly, a little sad and a little ashamed. He goes out. Neff is alone. He watches the door close, then turns and goes slowly to the water cooler. He fills a paper cup and stands holding it. His thoughts are somewhere else. After a moment he absently throws the cupful of water into the receptacle under the cooler. He goes back to the desk. He takes his rate book out of his brief case and puts it on the desk. He leaves the office, with his briefcase under his arm. Neff's coupe comes down the street and swings into the garage and goes down the ramp into the basement. There are about eight cars parked. A colored attendant in coveralls and rubber boots is washing a car with a hose and sponge. Neff's car comes into the shot and stops near the attendant. Neff gets out with his briefcase under his arm. He is folding a hand towel and stuffing it into his jacket pocket. He then takes a large roll of adhesive tape and puts that into his pants pocket. Neff's hand places a small card against the bell clapper in each of these.",
    "127": "CAMERA PANS with Neff going down the stairs in his blue suit, with a hat pulled down over his eyes. Some windows are lit. Neff comes into the shot and approaches cautiously. He looks around and then slides open the garage door. Neff closes the garage door. Very faint light comes in at a side window. He opens the rear door of the sedan, gets in and closes the door after him. The dark interior of the car has swallowed him up. Phyllis drives on and never turns her head. She stares straight in front of her. Her teeth are clenched. The station is visible about sixty yards away. Ten or twelve cars are parked diagonally, not crowded. The train is not in yet, but there is activity around the station. Passengers and their friends, redcaps and baggage men, news vendors, etc. The Dietrichson sedan drives into the shot past CAMERA and parks in the foreground at the outer end of the line, several spaces from the next car, facing away from the CAMERA. Both front doors are open. Phyllis gets out and from the other side crutches emerge, and a man (seen entirely from behind, and apparently Dietrichson) climbs out awkwardly. While he is steadying himself on the ground with the crutches, Phyllis has taken out Dietrichson's suitcase and overcoat. She walks around the car and rolls up the right front window. She closes and locks the car door. She tries the right rear door and takes a last look into the dim interior of the car. Then she and the man walk slowly away from the car to the end of the station platform and along it toward the station building, Phyllis walks several steps ahead of the man. CAMERA FOLLOWING THEM, a little to one side, so that Phyllis is clearly seen but the man's face is not. Phyllis nods. They go on. Over them is heard the noise of the train coming into the station and its lights are seen. The train is just coming to a stop. The passengers move forward to the tracks. Phyllis, carrying the suitcase and overcoat, and Neff, still a little behind her, come TOWARDS THE CAMERA. A redcap sees them and runs up. He takes the suitcase out of Phyllis' hand. Phyllis hands the overcoat to the redcap, who leads her and Neff towards car number nine. Neff still hangs back and keeps his head down, the way a man using crutches might naturally do. The pullman conductor and porter stand at the steps. The conductor is checking the tickets of passengers getting on. The redcap leads Phyllis and Neff into the SHOT. The conductor and porter see Neff on his crutches and move to help him.",
    "1283": "Stunned people pick themselves up off the ground. The vast metallic-skinned robot stands immobile, the sphere swirling in light and vapor behind it. The visitor's body is rushed to a medical facility. It's on a covered gurney. Helen is with it. A sarcophagus-like gurney is wheeled to a prefab hut in a hanger. The protective cover is unsealed. Mike looks baffled. She glances at Mike. His scalpel cuts into the patient's gray, gelatinous skin. The gray skin is coming apart as the surgeon drops the bullet into a sample tube. Helen slowly shakes her head. The surgeon wearing a suit which even covers his feet drops lumbs of blubbery flesh into a basin. On the operating table the naked slime covered body of a man curles up into a fetal position. Mike and Helen stare in disbelief. The patient lies under a protective tent attended by a technician. Helen enters the room. She descends three steps from the gallery area where she was watching and cautiously approaches the tent. She peers in and sees the man's eyes fluttering. Patient is thrashing around inside the tent. Mike comes in and checks a monitor. The Secretary's chopper touches down at Fort Linwood. The being is lying on a gurney wearing gray hospital pajamas and an oxygen mask. The officials stand at a window overlooking the room. Watched closely by Helen, Mike removes the oxygen mask and offers the being a cup of water. He takes it and draws it shakily towards him. They all watch him intently. The Secretary takes a step towards him. He uses both hands to steady the plastic beaker. They all stare. Regina glances at the scientists. Helen steps forward to help him put down the cup. He looks just like the climber from 1928. His head swivels towards her. She enters a storeroom with shelves full of vials of drugs. She leans back against the door and composes herself, then takes a hypodermic in a sealed packet from a glass cabinet. She puts it in her pocket, then scans the shelves. The agent hands her a vial. She pockets a vial of saline solution, goes to the syringe cabinet and opens, then closes the door. She turns and holds up the syringe packet for the benefit of the suspicious agent. Jaw thrust forward, Regina eyeballs Klaatu. Having swapped the two vials, Helen approaches him. She rolls up his sleeve and jabs the hypodermic into his arm. The Defense Secretary watches dispassionately, then turns away. His dark eyes stare at Helen. Three military policemen surround Helen and escort her from the room. Klaatu glances down at his arm as the agent from the drugstore comes in. They eyeball one another.",
    "129": "In contrast to those about him, there is tension in Godse's face, an air of danger in his movements. He glances at two policemen who are talking casually, absorbed in their own gossip -- then he looks back at another Tonga that pulls up just behind his. Two young men (Apte and Karkare) meet Godse's gaze, and again we get the sense of imminent danger. They descend and pay their driver absently, their eyes watching the crowd. Sitting alone in the shadows of a stationary Tonga a little distance down the street an elderly man (Prakash) with a short, close-cropped beard and the taut, sunken flesh of a cadaver is watching. Apte and Karkare look back at him. There is just the slightest acknowledgment and then Prakash lifts his eyes to the gate, as though to tell them to be about their business. Godse hesitates before approaching the two gardeners who nonchalantly flank the entrance. He stiffens himself, cautiously touches something under his khaki jacket, then glances back at the stoic face of Prakash. Prakash's gaze is as firm and unrelenting as a death's head. Godse turns back, wetting his lips nervously, then moves into the middle of a group going through the gate. A fairly numerous crowd is gathering here, informally filling the area on one side of a walk that leads to a little pavilion -- some devout, some curious, some just eager to be near the great man. Apte and Karkare move to different sides of Godse, staying a little behind, their movements sly and wary, aware of people watching. We see him distantly through the crowd. We do not see him clearly until the very last moment -- only glimpses of him as he smiles, and exchanges little jokes with some of the crowd and the two young women who support him, occasionally joining his hands together in greeting to someone in particular, then once more proceeding with a hand on the shoulder of each of the girls. The camera keeps moving closer, and the point of view is always Godse's, but Gandhi is always in profile or half obscured by the heads and shoulders of those in front. He slides through to the very front rank. His breathing is short and there is perspiration around the sides of his temples. And now, for an instant we see Gandhi close from his point of view. He is only a few steps away, but turned to speak to someone on the other side, and Manu half obscures him. Godse swallows dryly, tension lining his face -- then he moves boldly out into Gandhi's path, bumping Manu, knocking a vessel for incense from her hands. Ignoring her, his nerves even more taut, Godse joins his hands together and bows in greeting to the Mahatma.",
    "1290": "STUDENTS bustle in, as the teacher, MR. TINKER tries to maintain order. Juno heads toward her desk and sets down her bag. Juno looks up and meets eyes with her longtime lab partner: Bleeker. GIRL LAB PARTNER stalks off dramatically. Juno examines a large ad in the newspaper that depicts a distraught TEEN GIRL clutching her head in a moment of staged conflict. She SMACKS the phone a couple of times. A HEALTH TEACHER in slo-mo puts a condom on a banana. We see Paulie's face at the moment of his deflowering: he's comically wide-eyed with shock. Juno, her father MAC, her stepmother BREN, and LIBERTY BELL sit at a very typical kitchen table, eating dinner. MAC shovels food while chatting about his day. PILE OF NEGLECTED CACTI festering in a corner of Juno's room. BREN is cutting up LIBERTY'S food diligently. Her nails are brilliant, holding the silverware. Bren stitches a needlepoint pillow of a dog. Bren's nail salon in all its glory. Bren chats up a customer as she applies a fresh coat. Bren speaks in her strong city accent. We see Liberty Bell blithely pouring bacon bits onto her dinner. Juno trudges toward the front entrance of the clinic. Juno recognizes the PROTESTER as a classmate of hers. She continues on toward the clinic entrance. She considers the concept, then pushes open the clinic door. The receptionist sits behind a pane of bulletproof glass. Juno flashes her best jazz hands. The receptionist raises a pierced eyebrow and arranges some paperwork on a clipboard. The receptionist hands Juno the clipboard and a pen. The receptionist reaches into one of those ubiquitous women's clinic CONDOM JARS, and holds up a fistful of purple rubbers. The waiting room is semi-crowded, occupied mostly by pregnant women, teens and ill-behaved children. She points to the paper and motions for Juno to look. Juno scans the ad silently. We see the ad. It contains a photo of an attractive couple with ambiguous Mona Lisa smiles. We see Paulie's bedroom window -- festooned with childish curtains -- and the light on inside. Bleeker lies on his Car-bed in his track uniform, listening to the same LP from when he and Juno went all the way. He stares between the pages of his embossed Dancing Elk Prep yearbook. We see the object of his gaze is Juno's black and white YEARBOOK PHOTO. Next to it, we see a sloppy, handwritten message from Juno. Bren and Mac are predictably speechless. Leah presents the Penny Saver photos of the Lornings. Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate. Music plays as we see SPARSE IMAGES OF VANESSA LORING'S HANDS preparing the house for Juno's arrival -- Sprucing a vase of FLOWERS.",
    "1292": "Juno parks her PREVIA on the street. BLEEKER'S MOM answers, visibly annoyed. Her eyes drift down to Juno's middle. Bleeker glances at Juno's midsection, embarrassed. Bleeker smiles faintly. He nervously cracks open a container of ORANGE TIC-TACS and pours them into his mouth. Juno walks over to the bed and sits down next to Bleeker. Bleeker is visibly relieved. Bleeker picks at the carpet, dejected. The house is covered in fresh snow. The walls are primed slate gray. Vanessa points to the nursery's largest wall. Mark stares at the wall, looking lost. Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised. Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling CD's. Mark mouths along with the lyrics. Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up. We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore. A door suddenly slams upstairs. Juno jumps up and rushes out. Vanessa is obviously entertaining some worse-case scenarios. She holds the ULTRASOUND up to show Vanessa and drapes her arm around her. Juno glances at Mark and again at Vanessa. A beat as Bren absorbs this. Juno heads to the URN by the door and defiantly pours the remains of her blue slushie into the URN. Mark looks jolted, as if it's the first time he considered that her baby might have a father. He gestures awkwardly to Juno's belly. Mark leads Juno into the kitchen, where he pours two drinks. Mark drops his head, dejected. Mark instantly smiles. Smiles. Juno and Leah are walking through the mall, looking bored. Juno is wearing one of Mac's giant hockey jerseys in lieu of actual maternity wear. Leah gnaws on a giant cinnamon pretzel. She wrestles Leah for the pretzel. Onlookers stare at them, appalled, as Leah puts Juno in a half-Nelson. They're watching a group of well-heeled women and their children shopping en masse. And one of the women is VANESSA, looking vaguely detached. They watch Vanessa for a few more moments. The other kids wander over toward the play area while their mothers ignore them. Vanessa continues to entertain the children. Juno tries her best to look enthused. Vanessa is admiring the belly, when Juno grimaces. She grabs Vanessa's hand and plants it on her stomach. Vanessa moves her hand, wanting desperately to feel the baby. Vanessa looks like she's giving up hope. Vanessa kneels down next to the swell of Juno's belly. CU on Juno's tray sliding along, picking up an odd combo of pregnant food. Pull up to find Juno and Leah walking their trays to a table. Juno and Leah are sitting inside an emptied awards case on the wall, eating their lunch. Juno notices that the other kids in the cafeteria can't help but glance her way.",
    "1293": "She illustrates by making a rounded gesture near her stomach. We see KEITH the teacher talking to some science kids in the background. He has a Wild America beard. He lifts a cup of coffee to his lips and slurps lustily. Bleeker retrieves a book from his open locker. Juno marches up to him, belly leading the way. Juno is clearly AFFRONTED. A GIRL strides past (obviously KATRINA) with a sour look aimed squarely at Juno. She starts to walk away. Juno picks up her BACKPACK dejectedly and slides it over her shoulder. She's about to walk away, when. Juno climbs ungracefully into the van. Mark is seated at the computer, surfing a horror movie website. He has the blank expression of a bored obsessive. Mark breaks into a grin. Mark opens the door. Juno stands there, looking radiantly knocked-up. She holds a stack of CDs. He gestures for Juno to follow him into the house. The Lorings' basement is dank, cluttered unfinished and unattractive, much like Paulie Bleeker's. Mark pulls a chain to illuminate a bare bulb. Juno examines the comic. There's a battered portable CD player in the corner. She mockingly places her hands on Mark's waist and moves back and forth stiffly. They SWAY slowly to the music. Juno's belly bumps up against Mark. Juno rests her head on Mark's chest. They dance in silence for a few moments, then stop moving. Juno backs away. Mark suddenly sees Juno for what she is -- a teenage girl. Juno turns to leave, then shoots one furious look back at Mark. Juno reaches the top of the stairs and scrambles toward the front door, only to be intercepted by Vanessa, who's returning home from work, carrying her briefcase and a freshly purchased NURSING PILLOW. It's obvious from Juno's tears and flushed face that she's lying. She rushes toward the door. Juno halts. Juno looks totally betrayed. Vanessa looks at Juno's expression and knows Mark is lying. Juno's face continues to fall. Vanessa notices. Vanessa sighs. Vanessa looks defeated. Vanessa and Mark look over and notice that Juno has escaped the conflict. Juno runs up to her car sobbing. It's quiet after the storm. Juno buckles over the steering wheel, crying, unwinding for the first time since she became pregnant. Bleeker is sitting next to his bed, noodling on the guitar. He's playing a theme that we will soon recognise. Juno lays on the hood of her Previa, contemplating her future. After a beat, she begins to gather herself. She hops off the hood and scurries into the Previa where she finds a crumpled up Jiffy Lube receipt. She unfolds it and pulls out a pen, ready to write something.",
    "1295": "Bo finally looks at her father. She smiles softly. Graham looks in the direction of THE BOY'S VOICE. Merill picks up Bo and rushes through the crops. He finds MORGAN standing with his hands in the pockets of his pajama bottoms. Merill puts Bo on the ground and moves right in front of Morgan. The ten-year old boy looks deep in thought. Graham takes hold of Morgan's chin and turns his face so he's looking straight at him. Morgan's eyes reveal he's come to some answer. Morgan takes hold of his father's unshaven chin and turns his face. Graham is forced to look to his right. Graham sees something. Graham Hess slowly rises to his feet. He starts moving forward towards something. He walks through a thin layer of crops and emerges in a clearing. Graham Hess looks around in a daze as he walks out into the center. Merrill, Bo and Morgan follow him. Two German Shepherds are running back and forth. The dogs keep running and barking as WE PULL BACK AND REVEAL. They are clearly agitated. Graham turns off the phone. He turns to put it on the counter and realizes his children are seated on the kitchen floor with one of their two German Shepherds. There is a LARGE PUDDLE on the kitchen tiles. Graham looks at the majestic dog. It's shivering. Morgan and Bo lead their dog out with worried expressions on their faces. A police officer stands on the other side of the screen door. OFFICER EDGAR PASKI nods that he knows. Graham stares at Officer Paski. Morgan pokes the barbecue fork into two meat patties on the grill. He places two pieces of cheese on the hamburgers, before walking over to Houdini. Bo is about to pour the glass of water into the dog bowl. She moves to Houdini, who sits in the shade by the picnic table. Takes a tiny sip of the water first. She stops. She holds the glass out to Morgan. He drinks. The two children sit down in the grass with the dog. Bo shrugs and pours it into the bowl. Houdini just sits staring at them. He is not shivering. He is unnaturally still. Bo pushes the bowl closer. HOUDINI BEGINS TO GROWL. The children turn white. Bo stands up. Houdini crouches down. The German Shepherd trembles. His body tightens. He's about to leap. Officer Paski stands up. He turns back and stares in the direction of the house. Morgan's attention moves as the crops part and his father and Officer Paski enter the backyard. They stop cold when they look in his direction. They begin a slow walk towards him. Morgan Hess is seated under the jungle gym with Houdini on his lap.",
    "13": "Jane picks up the address book, frowning. We're across from Jane's WINDOW, looking in. She speaks into the phone, but we can't hear her. BARBARA FITTS stands at the stove, flipping bacon strips mechanically, her eyes focused elsewhere. At least ten years younger than her husband, she's pretty in a June Cleaver-ish way. Ricky enters. Startled, Barbara turns to him. As she attempts to serve him bacon. Ricky serves himself scrambled eggs from another pan, then joins his father at the table. The Colonel sits at a dinette reading The Wall Street Journal. The Colonel and Barbara look at each other, alarmed. The Colonel heads toward the living room, a little puffed up. The Colonel opens the front door to reveal the two JIMS. Jim #1 holds out a basket filled with flowers, vegetables and a small white cardboard box tied with raffia. The Colonel stares at them, suspicious. The Jims look at each other, then back at the Colonel. The Colonel looks at them, confused. Then it dawns on him. The Colonel drives, staring darkly at the road ahead. In the passenger seat, Ricky is using a CALCULATOR and jotting numbers down in a NOTEBOOK. The Colonel looks at Ricky sharply. The Colonel's eyes flash angrily. A beat, as Ricky continues his calculations, before he realizes a response is expected from him. Ricky sighs, then looks at his father. The Colonel is taken aback but quickly covers. Case closed, Ricky goes back to his calculations. CLOSE on the pencil in his hands: He's totaling two columns of NUMBERS. Jane and Angela are standing with two other TEENAGE GIRLS. The two TEENAGE GIRLS move away from Jane and Angela. The Colonel's Ford Explorer pulls up, and Ricky gets out. Angela stares at Jane, then her mouth widens into a smile. Jane suddenly finds Ricky standing in front of her. He looks at her intently, his eyes searching hers. Jane is unnerved and has to look away. Ricky smiles and walks off. Angela shoots a wide-eyed look at Jane, who ignores it. The Colonel and Barbara are seated on a couch, watching television. The Colonel is smiling, enjoying the show; Barbara just stares. The Colonel CHUCKLES at a joke and startles her. The three of them stare at the TV, like strangers in an airport. We FOLLOW THEM as they pass a SIGN that reads. Inside the ballroom, well-dressed real estate professionals stand in clumps, chatting. Catering waiters serve hors d'eouvres. Carolyn's jaw tightens, then. She drags Lester toward a silver-haired MAN and his much younger WIFE. We recognize the Man as BUDDY KANE, The Real Estate King. A little too loudly. Carolyn quickly joins in. She smiles her most winning smile at him.",
    "1301": "Graham stares at his VIEW OF THE FLOOR. Something's wrong. Graham stares at his family huddled on the couch. Graham takes in the news as he moves to the stairs. He takes a seat on the second to last step. He sits obscured by the balusters. The words hang in the air. Graham sits quietly on the second step of the stairs. All four put their hands in the air. They lower them and sit in silence. Merrill stands and leans against the wall. Everyone sits quietly for a moment. Merrill glances at Graham. Graham turns and looks at Merrill. They stare at each other quietly. They have a conversation without words. The sink is piled with pots and pans. It seems like every utensil and dish in the kitchen was used. One side of the dining room is lined with windows that have been boarded up. The table is set. The Hess family sits around the table. Morgan's face is hard, but tears start to fall anyway. Graham watches as both his children cry at the table. Graham takes big scoops of every dish and piles it on his plate. He digs his fork into the pile and starts to shove it in his mouth. He swallows. Merrill pounds furiously with his hammer as he nails boards to the children's bedroom door. The master bedroom door is open with a board leaning next to it. Graham is inside his bedroom. Graham walks to the window next to his bed. It's the same one we've looked out twice before. Graham looks out onto his backyard. Graham's eyes stay locked on the crops which go on and on into darkness. He moves closer to the glass. Watches the top of the corn stalks swaying slightly with the wind. Graham backs away from the window towards the middle of his bedroom. Graham turns to see Merrill standing with the last board in the hall. Graham moves out into the hall and shuts the bedroom door behind him. Merrill immediately puts the wooden board up and starts hammering nails into the frame. Graham picks up his hammer and quietly begins to hammer nails into the wood. Graham glances to his right as he works. Bo and Morgan are standing together at the top of the stairs. Bo holds Morgan's hand. Graham keeps hammering as he speaks. Graham stops hammering. Merrill keeps going. Graham smiles to himself as he remembers the moment. Merrill finishes hammering. Graham looks at his daughter quietly. He brushes the hair out of her face as Merrill moves to Morgan and picks him up. All four turn and look at the three boarded up bedroom doors. Merrill puts down Morgan.",
    "1308": "David gets startled. He puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet. He opens the door. Audrey stands in the darkened hall. Audrey nods. David stares at his wife. She starts crying. Tears roll over her very affected face. She tries to wipe them away, but there's too many. Audrey nods and walks down the stairs as she wipes her face. David watches her disappear into the shadows. The cavernous stadium opens up into a picture perfect blue sky. A line of ticket holders snakes towards two turnstiles where stadium crew are ripping tickets. David Dunne stands to one side with two other security guards. The fans moving through the turnstiles are clad in all types of Eagles paraphernalia. A group of girls carries a homemade banner that David reads as he tilts his head sideways. David stares at a woman carrying a newborn infant in her arms. The baby is wearing an eagles uniform. The WALKIE TALKIE on David's hip bursts to life. He pulls it off his hip and listens. David bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and continues walking. David moves to a security guard near the turnstiles. David walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to him. Elijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles. The GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnstile. David eyes him. Fifteen people away. Ten. The man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the stadium. AN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. Elijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself. David enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket. Elijah stares at David. David exhales slowly as he stares at Elijah. David's WALKIE ERUPTS WITH NOISE. The two men stand very still in the tunnel. David turns and starts down the hall. David talks back over his shoulder. Elijah watches as the silhouetted figure of David Dunne jogs down the darkness of the tunnel. We are inside a customized car. The dashboard is covered in some sort of thin foam padding. The steering wheel and gear shift have the same padding. Every corner and hard surface has been safe guarded. Elijah sits behind the wheel of his car in the parking lot of the stadium.",
    "131": "He too wears a prison uniform and there is a bandage on his head. When he turns and reacts to the sight of Gandhi. He takes his soup from Khan. Gandhi looks around the crowded yard at the soiled bandages, the defiant, determined faces. He is distracted by a phalanx of guards (an officer and four men) pushing their way through the prisoners. The prisoners are moving back from them resentfully but their glances reveal who Gandhi is. The prison officer's eyes fall on him. Gandhi -- now manacled -- is being marched down the pavement before two guards. The prison officer strides in front of them. The tall civil servant has been waiting for them. The prison officer reaches forward and undoes Gandhi's manacles. The tall civil servant, moving with aloof distaste for his assignment, walks ahead of Gandhi, who in turn is followed by one of the prison guards, toward a grand staircase that is at right angles to them (i.e. facing the front of the building). People working in offices pause to stare at Gandhi as he moves along, more uncomfortably aware of his prison garb than ever. The tall white doors open, the tall civil servant indicates that Gandhi enter. Gandhi passes two male secretaries, and the tall civil servant scoots decorously around him to knock once on the inner doors. Then he pushes them open and gestures Gandhi in. We have seen it before when Walker spoke to Smuts, but now we see its full breadth -- and the imposing figure Smuts makes as he stands behind the grand desk. He nods to the tall civil servant, who bows and closes the door. Smuts crosses the room toward a small cabinet. Smuts looks at Gandhi, a little surprised at the frigid tone of that refusal. Smuts smiles. A wry smile, and he sits on the edge of the chair Smuts has directed him to. Smuts measures him again, not absolutely certain how to deal with him. A pause, and he affects to take Gandhi's irony at face value. He measures Gandhi challengingly, obviously expecting some contest. Gandhi mulls it, then. Smuts stares at him. Gandhi stands, a little uncertain about the sudden change in his status. Smuts signs the last document, then sees Gandhi's doubt -- and misreads it. The tall civil servant (Daniels) enters. Daniel stares. Still a little confused, Daniels reaches in his pocket and produces a shilling. He hands it to Gandhi. And his own steel shows in the oblique reference to the ignominy of his way in. The prison guard appears in the doorway, looking off in confusion at Gandhi, then back at the office for guidance. A British general is coming down the gangplank accompanied by his ADC.",
    "1321": "Bob wanders in, squinting at the sudden presence of light. Headlights appear on the highway. Kyle stares at Audrey's beautiful, determined face. Then he pulls out his silver 45. The headlights become a family minivan careening wildly off the highway to stop at the pumps. They aim their weapons at the vehicle. A well dressed man in his mid-thirties jumps out of the car. He looks around nervously, scared. Then, seeing that the coast is clear, he offers a calming wave to his wife and young boy who wait anxiously for him inside the car. He races around to the gas pump. Kyle and Audrey spin to look out over the back side of the diner. An army of dark shapes are swarming in fast. Kyle looks urgently back at the family. The father lifts the pump. Kyle and Audrey wave their arms frantically at the family. Kyle fires his gun in the air. Blam! Blam! Blam! At the sound of gunfire, the man looks quickly up to the roof. His family heard it too and they start to scream to him. The man can only see silhouettes in this light, but he's not waiting around to see if it's friend or foe. Audrey watches in horror as the dark shapes reach the diner. The father dashes to the driver's side. He looks over his shoulder just in time to see a blur of movement rushing at him. His blood paints the car windows. Kyle raises his MP5 to fire upon the dark shapes that surround the vehicle like swarming insects. The possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them. He finds the young boy curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms. Kyle moves on to the mother. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him. Kyle freezes. Close on him as he senses something terribly wrong. Audrey raises the 45 and click. She keeps pulling the trigger. The boy's tears stop instantly. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner. Blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere. She's trapped. She notices the open door to the minivan. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. Clunk! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life. Charlie rushes to Michael's side. But he's immovable. Charlie cocks the gun, moves toward the door. Charlie looks back at him, defiant.",
    "1322": "Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed Charlie and out into hell. With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. In the minivan, Audrey screams as the windows begin to crack. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan. What's he up to? The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him. And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The spray of gas explodes into a spray of fire! The minivan is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows explode, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face circled. Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink. She fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher. The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy. She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the knife is driven down. CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife clatters to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his thumbs are missing. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. Charlie shakes her head no. Jeep's light catches something on the ground. Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck. Michael lowers his flashlight. A flickering light emanates from within the diner. Charlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs. Bob and Jeep keep watch. The spectral lights in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer. Jeep rests a comforting hand on his father's shoulder.",
    "1326": "Next to that, a faded diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. He deftly rolls an ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed dexterity. A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA and HOWARD ANDERSON. The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard with a caustic smile. And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Howard turns back to his wife. Rigid smile. The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren country. A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path. HEAVY BEATS thunder from within. KYLE WILLIAMS (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. He passes a weathered road sign. Kyle's expression says this is not good news. He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat. He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead. The Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. She lets out a long slow exhale. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Bob steps off the chair. Bob turns to Kyle. Bob is about to respond when. Howard approaches, oblivious to the conversation he's interrupting. Bob's expression darkens at this news. Jeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right alongside him, not giving up. Jeep stiffens. Turns to his father. Bob gives Jeep a hard stare. Jeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall.",
    "1327": "He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Dark clouds are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming. Bob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter, digging into a plate of banana pancakes. Kyle is about to address him again, when something else steals Bob's attention. The image flickers but doesn't improve. Bob gives the TV one final wallop -- WHACK! And the picture snaps into FOCUS. The stark graphic of the Emergency Broadcasting System and its accompanying hollow tone fill the diner. Everybody in the place stops and turns to the TV. Bob switches the channels. All the same. Bob steps off the chair and backs slowly away from the TV as if a little distance will bring some clarity. He bumps into Kyle. Kyle hustles passed Percy. Charlie is standing by the Anderson's table, clearing dishes. Everybody's eyes are locked on the TV. Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial. Everyone is looking at Howard. Kyle has reappeared in the diner. Jeep is buried under the Uhaul's hood, working at something with a socket wrench. The old lady turns to the Andersons. A fly begins to buzz around Gladys's head. Gladys smiles strangely. Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least. Howard and Sandra exchange looks. The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons. Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys. Charlie rests a hand on her belly. A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it away. But another one lands in its place. Charlie freezes. Kyle glances over from the counter. Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in. She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob. Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat. The flies are swarming now. How did so many get in here? Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events. Sandra covers her mouth in shock. Everybody in the diner is now focused on the old lady. Howard gets up from the booth. Everybody freaks as Howard crumbles to the floor. Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over. Blood covers her face and chest. Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head sideways.",
    "133": "Gandhi is staring at the street. From his point of view we hold on a gaunt young, aged woman holding a baby wrapped in rags as threadbare as her sari. Another hollow-faced child leans against her. A splendid peacock, its tail fanned in brilliant display, lords it on a velvet lawn. A woman in a sumptuous silk sari is trying to feed it crumbs. Behind her, Gandhi's reception is in full spate -- silver trays, tables covered in fine linen, Indian servants, a swimming pool, a small fountain, the grounds filled with Indian millionaires and dignitaries gathered with their wives to meet the new hero from South Africa. A beautiful and beautifully dressed woman (Mrs. Nehru) stands next to her distinguished husband (Motilal Nehru). She nods lightly toward Nehru. Featuring Nehru who is introducing Gandhi to two men, one tall, slender, ascetic looking, but dressed impeccably (Jinnah). The other with a haunting face -- beard, flowing dark hair, the air of a poet or a ruthlessly dedicated radical (Prakash -- whom we recognize from the opening sequence in Delhi at Gandhi's assassination). Gandhi has bowed to Jinnah, now he looks a little startled at Prakash. Prakash grins and makes the pranam to Gandhi. Gandhi nods. He meets Prakash's gaze firmly, the first moment we have seen any sign of the Gandhi of South Africa. Charlie Andrews touches Gandhi's arm, excusing himself to the others. Gandhi bows to the others and is led off to an Indian bishop in full clerical robes. Behind him we see Patel regaling a small group with some story of court or society. As Gandhi leaves, Jinnah, Nehru and Prakash watch him clinically. Except for the servants, Gandhi is the only Indian male not in European clothes. Gokhale is pleased, Gandhi amused. Another grin. Gokhale has started to walk with him, looking at him intently, penetratingly. It is brusque but affectionate; we know he regards Charlie as Gandhi does. He still hasn't smiled, but Gandhi and Charlie have. This is private -- beautiful and still. Gandhi walks along slowly, taking the pace of the ailing Gokhale. He grins self-deprecatingly but Gokhale persists. He pauses and looks at Gandhi -- and for the first time he smiles. When he speaks his voice is thick with feeling. His eyes are watery with emotion, but he stares at Gandhi rigidly. Gandhi sits by a window in the dimly lit coach. Ba sleeps on the seat next to him, another member of the party next to her. Gandhi's solemn eyes are studying the huddled humanity in the rocking coach. Gandhi writing in the cramped chaos of the Third Class coaches. A broad alluvial plain, the river threading through it, purple and gold in the rising sun.",
    "1337": "Javert is puzzled. Valjean and Javert hurry out across the factory yard and down the muddy track beyond to discover - A heavily laden cart has toppled onto the cart driver - Fauchelevent, the worker seen before taking a rest on a crate. The cart driver and the Foreman are trying to lift the cart off the crushed man, but it's too heavy, and the ground is too soft. Valjean, Javert and Javert's assistant all hurry to help, but they can't get a proper purchase in the spongy ground. Fauchelevent screams as the cart slowly sinks in the mud. He throws himself under the cart at this higher end, and braces himself to lift it from beneath. At one end the wheels of the cart have stopped sinking - the ground is harder here. Valjean goes to help Fauchelevent. Valjean holds Javert's gaze, challenging him to say more. Javert is not yet confident enough to continue. Fantine presses on down the steps, trying to ignore the sailors. They spot Fantine, mistaking her for a whore. The sailors then see whores start to appear from the shadows of warehouse doorways. The few men in the street choose their whores and disappear by the end of the chorus. A man selling dentures stands by his cart and we hear fragments of his sales pitch. Fantine walks down the steps with short hair, mocked by the voices of the whores on either side. Fantine heads to the tooth man. A PIMP and the HEAD WHORE watch her progress as the organ- grinder grinds out the music. Fantine looks towards the tooth man and the head whore. The pimp pushes her down. She grabs Fantine's cheeks and forces open her mouth to inspect her teeth. She opens her mouth, and the pincers go in, as everyone gathers round to watch. Fantine screams as the first tooth is removed. The pimp is passing among the whores, checking that they're all fit for business. He moves in on Fantine. Fantine looks up, a trickle of blood in one corner of her mouth. The whores cluster round her, hands reaching out to draw her in to their world. On the rotting warship, more whores appear out of the gaps of the hull to sing the chorus. Whore 3 bites her fingertip and applies her blood to rouge Fantine's cheeks. The whores perform for the benefit of Fantine on the orders of the head whore, as the head whore leads her towards the hulk. Whores sing from the warehouse doorways, from on top of the spars of the ships, writhing around figureheads and from the rotting ship. The pimp leads the captain down the middle of the whores to Fantine who wears a filthy white dress.",
    "1338": "The pimp joins the captain and Fantine's hands as the head whore officiates - like a twisted wedding ceremony. Fantine puts on a show of courage as she leads the captain into the ship's hulk, which is a brothel. Fantine, pale and frail, her bodice loosened, leads the captain down to the damp dregs of the ship. We see the rotting straw mattress within as they enter, then Fantine lays down. Close on a man's hand leaving money. Move to find Fantine lying alone on the mattress. She pulls herself into a sitting position against the head of the mattress. She has seen and recognised Valjean, some way off. He's out in the harbour district. He is talking to a beggar. Before he moves on, he hands over some money. She moves past the anchored ships, beneath the bowsprits, trying pathetically to attract custom. Fantine is out on the snow and ice-covered quayside, shivering, waiting for trade. She looks pale and sickly, but still attempts an alluring smile. As Fantine watches Valjean on his mission of mercy, a well-dressed young man, Bamatabois, comes up to her. He arrives with two friends and a valet. Javert is quietly coldly furious. He shows the blood. Fantine is almost fainting with fear, still racked with occasional spasms of coughing. Valjean steps out of the shadows. Javert turns to Fantine. Javert's assistants pick Fantine up. Javert indicates to the two policemen to drag Fantine away. To Fantine, it's as if he's come to her in a dream. Javert looks on, containing his anger, as Valjean reaches out a hand to Fantine. He holds Fantine's hands, looking into her face. Valjean picks Fantine up in his arms. As Valjean and Fantine move away, Javert stares after them, then turns and quietly instructs his assistant to follow after them. As Javert walks up the steps to his police station his assistant stops him with an urgent letter. Javert seizes it, opens it, and reads. As he reads, his expression changes. Appalled, he realizes he's made a terrible mistake. Valjean is at his desk in his office, going through his papers once everyone else has gone, when Javert enters and stands before him. Valjean conceals his shock. He looks up. Valjean is sitting staring at the Bishop's candlesticks. Valjean is furiously packing stuff up. The driver is Valjean, hesitating. Close on two horses panting. Valjean pushes through the crowds at the back of the courtroom. Before the judge has a chance to speak, the doors open and Valjean bursts in. The man accused of being Jean Valjean, a wretched down-and-out, stands before the judge. He looks uncannily like the real Valjean. Sensation in the court.",
    "1344": "We now see CHARLES, big and in an ill-fitting BLACK SUIT, and MARTIN, good looking, in a shirt and tie, at the buffet. CUT WIDE TO REVEAL that we are in a modest Ohio house in the year 1979. Forty-odd friends and neighbors, darkly dressed. Quiet discussions. Some crying. A grey, snow-covered, early February day here in LILLIAN, OHIO. Many cars are parked outside the house, notably a SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SQUAD CAR in the driveway. Joe, a vision of black on white in his too-big black suit, now sits on a small swing set he hasn't used in years. He solemnly looks down at the LOCKET he still holds. Then a SOUND. Joe looks up. A CAR has arrived -- a distinct 1968 BUICK GSX -- a YELLOW MUSCLE CAR with a BLACK RACING STRIPE down its center. Joe watches as the car sits there for a moment. Then a MAN gets out. A man in his early 40's, in jeans and a work shirt. Joe watches Louis carefully as he moves to the house, to the porch and inside the house. Joe's eyes glued on the house for a while. Then he looks back to the locket. And as he stares, TEARS come to his eyes. A moment broken by the SOUND OF RAISED VOICES -- Joe turns toward the house. After a beat, the SOUND of something BREAKING -- something glass. Then the house BACK DOOR bursts open -- Joe cranes his neck -- and what he sees he'll never forget: his father, Jack, leading an in-pain and HAND-CUFFED Louis Dainard from the house and into the rear of the squad car. When he slams the back door, he sees Joe. Sort of freezes as their eyes lock. But Jack's more uncomfortable. And Jack gets into the car and drives away. Joe watches them drive off. And after a beat, he looks down at the locket again. Finally he CLOSES IT. Hundreds of KIDS eagerly leave their last day of school for the year, winter a memory. GIRLS emphatically embrace each other good-bye. BOYS run off, just happy to be out. Suddenly Charles is there, red-faced -- he hands Joe PAGES. They head across the street to the 7-Eleven. Suddenly Cary is there, a BURN WRAP on his right arm now. Joe stops. His friends don't. Joe, Charles and Cary scan the candy aisle. Joe just nods and looks at the magazine. A hectic FAMILY: Charles' mother cooks. JEN, his smoking hot 17-year-old sister, ANGRILY sets the table where his father pays bills. Pale 15-year-old sister PEG does a PUZZLE. Twin 9-YEAR-OLD BOYS bicker over an action figure. TV in the living room plays a MATCH GAME.",

He is fucking scared; at least he's holding a rifle. He peels around a corner -- through a window, the tarmac: GUARDS, VEHICLES. Jack's eyes shift -- he spots an AIRCRAFT FUEL TANK. Eyes wild -- A METALLIC CLI-CHUNK AS HE UNSAFETIES THE. A SOLDIER crosses to a vehicle, on his radio when KAFA- BOOOOOM! The FUEL TANK EXPLODES, A MASSIVE BLAST! The airmen take cover, RUN TO MOVE NEARBY VEHICLES, GENERAL MAYHEM -- and our CAMERA BOOMS UP -- to the MILITARY JEEP THAT DRIVES. Jack behind the wheel, he blasts the vehicle through the exit, along the road back to town. Jack drives up in the jeep -- comes to a stop in SHOCKED CLOSE UP -- we see in the distance the MASS OF VEHICLES driving from town -- Jack's mind races. The jeep RACES past camera -- we PAN -- revealing as. Donny drives, Joe shotgun. Charles, Cary and Martin in back. Donny YANKS the steering wheel -- he turns onto a DIRT ROAD -- the car RUMBLES away from camera. Donny's car pulls up, lights go off. The kids pile out. A SHOT of the boys CLIMBING A FENCE. They move fast across the alley, to a TRAILER locked with A PADLOCK -- the DUNGEON. Joe tries PRYING the locks off with the tire iron -- it doesn't budge. Joe hands the tire iron to Charles -- he tries -- nothing. As Martin grabs the tire iron. Martin breaks off the LATCH -- BAM. Now we CUT TO DARKNESS -- we're INSIDE THE DUNGEON as it opens -- the boys look DIRECTLY AT US -- their faces say it all: THE MOTHER LODE. The boys -- with FLASHLIGHTS -- turn a corner -- hurry down the hall. The boys BREAK A CLASSROOM DOOR WINDOW and enter. We're looking down at the boys, SURROUNDED by hundreds of documents, boxes, photographs, 16MM film cannisters and cassette tapes. Charles threads the film. Joe holds up a 20-year-old PHOTO of MEN IN A LAB. Among them is 50-year-old WOODWARD. Cary puts a CASSETTE into a tape deck, hits PLAY. We see inside a HANGAR, where dozens of SCIENTISTS examine LARGE, BUS-SIZED pieces of jagged and unearthly material. Scientist explaining something to a group of SENIOR OFFICERS. Among them, a 32-year-old NELEC. Film JUMP CUTS to a HUGE REINFORCED LAB CAGE. Inside, sitting almost in a ball, IS THE MASSIVE CREATURE. Another JUMP CUT as a SOLDIER offers a bucket of FOOD to the alien -- IT'S WOODWARD.",
    "135": "He is chairing the Congress. Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the auditorium. A man made for the spotlight, a man loving the spotlight. At last he moves back to his place on the platform. Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation. Others crowd around him. And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform. He is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah. Featuring Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands. And again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. He raises his hands, stilling them again. Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. He is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it. Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause. Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them. But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility. Again Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his sleeve. This is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium. He puts his glasses on and faces the convention. On the platform, the whispered politics go on. On the floor of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things. Nehru has turned, having caught that last remark. And now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too. Jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly. He takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform. A cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly. On the platform, the leaders join in perfunctorily. We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways. Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel. An open touring car struggling along the bumpy trail. Nehru drives, four friends as young as he with him, all dressed in the same expensive, British manner. Nehru is looking a little harassed, from the ragging he is taking and from the ride. The ashram is only half-finished, the ground unworked, the buildings only partially completed and the whole looking like some primitive frontier outpost. They are finally brought to a halt by a goat that is tethered right across the path.",
    "1350": "A soldier hurries off. Joe in the lead - they turn and look back -- a massive shot of the neighborhood under fire -- houses getting BLOWN TO SHIT in collateral damage. An EXPLOSION HITS TOO CLOSE -- the boys SCREAM as they run BETWEEN HOUSES -- and WE TRACK WITH THEM -- four boys racing through a neighborhood under siege -- power GOES OUT -- and some explosions are much closer than others -- another BIG HIT and they go to a back door of a house -- and go inside. They run in for cover -- they're silhouetted in this dark space by the EXPLOSION LIGHT emanating from the windows. They're all out of breath in a strange KITCHEN. Another CRAZY LOUD AND BRIGHT EXPLOSION -- the light fixtures sway. Charles grabs a coke on the counter. Another fucking LOUD BLAST -- sound of GLASS BREAKING -- and the creature ROARING -- And there it is, in silhouette, moving past the bay window -- Joe realizes: where the creature is, so are the blasts. Joe runs -- the others follow. But as they get to the living room a HUGE EXPLOSION BLOWS OUT A WALL! They all go down -- but Martin is in agony all of a sudden -- his leg RIPPED by concrete. But there's blood and Martin is in real pain. Charles wants the tie around the curtains, still hanging on the wall that now has a HOLE in it; MILITARY VEHICLES can be seen driving past outside. Joe hands Charles the thick fabric tie -- which Charles fashion into a tourniquet, wraps it around Martin's leg, tight. Charles looks at Martin -- can't argue. Charles nods -- Joe looks to Cary. Martin screams. Joe and Cary run through the semi-demolished neighborhood, many houses shattered, some cars obliterated. The only lone figures in town. Joe and Cary stop, out of breath, at the graves. Joe and Cary run through the graveyard and over to the. They're out of breath -- they try ONE garage door, windows CAKED WITH DIRT. The SECOND door. Dirt-caked windows. The third is a barn door -- they try it: locked. The two begin KICKING the door together -- on three -- one -- two -- CRASH! Again and again, until finally the door KICKS OPEN -- and they almost FALL INSIDE -- and thank goodness they didn't -- because -- and now we're looking STRAIGHT DOWN FROM INSIDE THE SHED -- the entire floor of the shed has been DUG OUT -- DROPPING FORTY FEET STRAIGHT DOWN, dirt PILED, caked along the sides of the structure. The boys catch their breath. Cary opens his backpack, whips out a Fourth of July SPARKLER.",
    "1351": "Jack drives fast in a Jeep that roars past, with Louis sitting beside him. It's awkward but not angry. Finally, Louis is vulnerable, scared, and sad. Jack looks at him for a moment, then back to the road, giving a small nod of forgiveness and gratitude. Louis wants to cry again but just accepts it. Joe begins climbing down a rope and lands on the bottom of a hole, which is dark as hell. He looks up to see Cary climbing down into the hole, with the barn roof looming above him. Now Cry lands too. There are three possible ways to go, and Joe's mind races about which way to go. They begin their walk into the dirt tunnel, which is a tall oval. They are so far away that the screen is mostly black, with a small speck of sparkly light. They come to an area littered with the stuff of a living room and look up to see another hole leading down, dug straight through a house. They continue, coming to an intersection where a new tunnel branches off. There's dim light from up ahead where the tunnel bends, and the rumbling/mechanical sound is louder now. Joe and Cary slowly move forward, seeing something off-camera that scares and amazes them all at once. They cross to the other side, where Cary bumps into a hanging Sheriff Pruitt. Cary is about to scream, but Joe puts a hand on his mouth and leads him away from Pruitt. Makeshift hanging bulbs provide some light; a number of other tunnels are visible from here, too. Joe and Cary look at the space in disbelief. Then Joe sees something that makes him grab at Cary's shirt. Cary looks through the mass of metal and machinery and sees a human leg. Joe and Cary would scream if they didn't need to stay quiet, speaking in a panicked whisper. Joe moves away from Cary to get a better view of the other side of the machinery and there he sees, in an inset section of the rock-wall, three human bodies hanging. Tight on Joe as he sees, among them, Alice. His heart pounds, his resolve quadruples. Cary sees her too. Stay with Cary, who opens his backpack, starts pulling out his amazing array of explosives, glancing up to make sure he's out of the creature's view. Move fast with Joe as he races, a lit sparkler giving him his light, the mechanical rumbling all but gone now. Joe runs, looking for another way into the creature's massive space, he finally finds another intersection, turns into it, and disappears down the tunnel. A lighter is used to light something, which is then dropped into a nearly-dug hole where it burns on the dirt floor, lighting up a tunnel at the bottom. The thing falls far enough to tell them it's too far to jump.",
    "1352": "Cary's made a long, insane pile of FIRECRACKERS -- he uses an OPEN M-80 and begins laying a SQUIGGLY, LONG LINE OF GUN POWDER back, away from the firecrackers -- away from the entrance to the creature's CONTRAPTION space. The SPARKLER DIES as LIGHT BEGINS TO REVEAL JOE, who slows -- peers around the dirt tunnel bend -- he is now on the OTHER SIDE of the space. He sees the creature -- then looks across to the lifeless body of Alice. Cary's done laying out the charges -- he pulls out his lighter -- FFFT! FFFT! The damn thing won't light. FFT! FFT! No go -- he keeps trying. Joe watches as the creature FINISHES WITH ITS MEAL AND HEADS. Cary frantically trying the lighter -- FFT! FFT! FFT. She's CATCHING HER BREATH, nodding, looking at him, amazed. She GRABS HIM AND HUGS HIM TIGHT, teary and grateful -- during which -- quietly. But she breaks out of the hug and grabs his shirt, intense. TINA, a 24-year-old, disoriented woman with curlers in her hair, wakes up. Joe and Alice have helped down one FAMILIAR FACE: SHERIFF PRUITT. They're out of breath, but their survival instinct has kicked in. Joe and Alice follow. They run into a tunnel. He takes off. Sparkler lighting the way, we're with Joe and Alice -- Pruitt and Tina behind them. Terrifying as the foursome sprint in the opposite direction! After RUNNING HARD for a beat: They haul ass, but after a long moment TINA IS GRABBED AWAY INTO THE DARKNESS!!! HER SCREAMS CONTINUE behind them -- They run and run and run, but then BOOM: they hit a DEAD END. A DIRT WALL. Out of breath, they turn -- but dare not go back toward the horrifying blackness. The only SOUND the sparkler, their erratic breathing and the. AND THE THING LOOKS AT HIM. REALLY LOOKS AT HIM. AND AFTER A LONG, SCARY BEAT, THE CREATURE SETS HIM DOWN. Joe backs up as the creature TURNS FAST AND SPEEDS AWAY. FORMED -- but here, as he is being hugged by his father, Joe LOOKS DOWN: SOMETHING IN HIS POCKET Is MOVING -- he considers it, confused for a moment -- but he reaches in and pulls it out. HIS MOTHER'S NECKLACE -- and he holds the chain, but the LOCKET PULLS TOWARD THE WATER TOWER -- wanting to go. Joe knows what this means. AND THIS IS WHEN WE GO INTO SLOW MOTION -- FROM HERE UNTIL THE END. After a long beat, Joe HOLDS THE NECKLACE UP, toward the tower -- the thing PULLING. TEARS in Joe's eyes as he looks up at it -- not wanting to let go, but knowing he must.",
    "1353": "Joe and Charles enter. Charles grabs a roll. Joe nods as Jack forces a smile and closes the bathroom door. HOLD ON JOE. Stunned and heartsick. Joe and his father, in civvies, sit beside each other at the counter. Jack pulls out a PAMPHLET, and places it on the table. Joe looks at the pamphlet for HEWITT SPORTS CAMP. Images of happy, smiling, healthy ATHLETIC KIDS. Joe looks back at the pamphlet -- his other hand coming up from under the table -- and Jack sees that Joe is HOLDING HIS MOTHER'S LOCKET. Jack wants to cry again. He wants to throw that locket away, out of sight. But he just turns away. Joe stares at the pamphlet. TIGHT ON QUASIMODO; a plastic, painted AURORA model. RACK FOCUS to the paintbrush that comes into frame -- FOLLOW IT TO JOE, holding the brush, at his desk, making a model. A boy's room recently devoid of a mother's oversight; a mess. COMIC BOOKS and other PLASTIC MODELS, all built and painted by Joe. CARS and CREATURES and a TRAIN. All the boys look. Their faces BRIGHTEN. Headlights. The boys stand as the car STOPS beside them -- IT'S THE YELLOW BUICK. But now, sitting in the driver's seat is 14-year-old ALICE DAINARD. She sees Joe. Looking away, she's pissed. All the boys in silent wait. She considers, annoyed. Shakes her head. The boys EXCITEDLY SCRAMBLE into the car. The Buick crosses the nighttime horizon, leaving the small town, driving through a rural landscape. Cary messes with the radio. Alice looks at him in the rear view. Their eyes hold a beat. She takes the Twizzler he offers and looks back to the road. Joe walks past Alice, who watches him. Martin sits alone with his copy of the pages, quietly reading and memorizing his lines. And she looks at him. Almost as if she were looking for something. Joe stops stippling. The tension is almost too much for him to bear. He indicates the sponge: it's for the make-up. She does. Joe starts applying the make-up to her eyelids. There's something provocative for Joe, being so close to Alice, with her eyes closed. Alice has been made up, wears a coat with purse. Martin, in his tie, faces her. They both look over their script pages as Charles adjusts the camera. Joe, observing, holds the boom mike (a condenser mike taped to a broom handle), Preston wears an overcoat. POP! Everyone JUMPS -- Charles turns -- Cary, laughing, has just exploded a firecracker. Martin and Alice now perform as their characters, DETECTIVE JOHN HATHAWAY and MRS. REBECCA HATHAWAY. Preston walks past them, acting in the background. We're TIGHT ON JOE NOW, watching Alice.",
    "1354": "Slowly amazed at the unexpected depth and truth she brings to this role. And holy shit, Alice actually starts to cry as she performs her lines. Charles watches -- in awe -- he's suddenly, giddily transported. But it's JOE who, as he stares, becomes galvanized; any vague interest in Alice has just set. Martin is thrown by the passion and heart of her performance. And in the heat of it, Alice looks at Charles, unsure. As Charles runs to Alice, takes her script pages. They're set to film toward Alice, the approaching train in her background -- Charles puts on the headphones. And they're shooting. Joe looks back at the headlights -- and sees something very odd: the distant vehicle TURNS ONTO THE TRACKS. PUSH IN ON JOE, unsettled -- as the train CROSSES THEM NOW -- Joe looks back toward Alice -- a BLAST OF AIR, shockingly LOUD. Alice and Martin continue to yell their lines -- Charles is almost LAUGHING at how good this looks -- but Joe LOOKS DESPERATELY BACK toward the headlights -- the train LIGHTING. And Joe finally swings the mike down and YELLS. They run off. Just the odd, dying CHUGS and SCREECH-SCREECH- SCREECH of TRAIN WHEELS running out of momentum, HISSES of STEAM, the unnatural bending of steel. In the DUST, JOE lies frightened on the ground, eyes tightly shut. His mind races, his heart pounds -- and then: A LOUD METAL BANG! Joe stands up fast, faces a MOUNTAIN of twisted STEEL -- UPSIDE-DOWN TRAIN CARS PILED FRIGHTENINGLY around him. Just another few feet and he would've been crushed. But what was that sound? Something metal? Then again: SLAM! Joe BACKS UP, afraid -- it was almost a LABORED GROAN -- MECHANICAL or ANIMAL?! A crazy SCREECH, another BANG, then AGAIN and AGAIN!!! We see Joe TIGHTLY GRIPPING HIS NECKLACE LOCKET IN HIS HAND -- THEN: CRASH! -- AWFUL-LOUD -- and a TWISTED TEN-FOOT SQUARE. -- Joe covers his head as the metal STABS THE GROUND, twenty feet away: a TRAIN SLIDING DOOR. Joe turns to see it -- stunned -- then back to the direction of the NOISE -- but it is GONE. TIGHT ON CHARLES' CAMERA -- on its side, FINISHING UP A. Joe MOVES FORWARD -- up to camera -- behind him, Cary appears, smiling. This kid enjoyed the crash. Joe WHIPS AROUND -- standing in the dusty mess is ALICE -- shaken, but absolutely alive. Joe just BEAMS. But JOE SUDDENLY KNOWS -- he moves to the blood -- reaches below the wheels -- the others watch, freaked out. Joe pulls out his CRUSHED MAKE-UP KIT. He brightens. Joe looks -- they all move to Preston (except Cary, who heads off): CRATES have spilled from a nearby split car; many shattered, revealing THOUSANDS OF SMALL WHITE-METAL CUBES which now litter the ground.",
    "1355": "Joe kneels, picks one up. Behind them, having walked up the ANGLED SIDES of overturned train cars, Cary calls out. They move up the mass of metal, revealing a VAST VIEW OF THE WRECK. It seems to stretch on forever. He points. Thrown fifty yards from the main wreckage is THE PICK-UP TRUCK. SHEARED IN HALF UPON IMPACT and lying in the overgrown grass. BOOM UP from behind the SHATTERED PICK-UP as the kids approach from the wreckage. PUSH IN ON THEM as they arrive at the truck and STOP; what they see makes Joe's heart pound -- they're stunned -- all of them. They just stop. WE SEE NOW: it's DR. WOODWARD -- 75, seat-belted, bloody and unconscious, stuck inside the crushed wreckage. Alice moves closer, scared and sad for him. But he's apparently dead; when she nudges him, he LEANS, his arm drops limp from the steering wheel, where he was HOLDING A PAPER, that has now fallen onto the ground. Joe picks it up. UNFOLDS IT: it's an OLD MAP -- thin, off-white paper. They hold it up, the map now backlit and obscuring Woodward. We see MARKER WRITING ON IT -- a BLACK LINE, from Nevada to Dayton -- and NUMBERS written along the way. But a SHADOW has appeared: A TREMBLING HAND -- before they can react, it RIPS THE MAP AWAY -- THEY ALL SCREAM AS OLD DR. WOODWARD IS REVEALED, BLOODY EYES OPEN, in a DAZE. They're all speechless for a moment. Finally, too loudly. We're on Joe's stunned face -- but DISTANT VOICES make him turn his head: hundreds of yards away, through the wreck. The rest turn to look -- their minds are racing, all of them. The kids start moving away. Charles arrives on the platform, grabs his camera. Alice hurries past, hunting for her keys in that big purse -- she eyes the FLASHLIGHT MEN getting closer. Joe grabs his make-up kit -- another duffel -- runs for the car, past a whining Charles. As the FLASHLIGHT MEN APPROACH, Joe runs and gets in the front seat, the other boys in back -- Alice SLAMS the car into REVERSE, SCREECH-BACKS UP, narrowly avoids debris, then RIDES OFF -- the FLASHLIGHT MEN arrive -- SOLDIERS -- their adrenaline pumping. One man who WALKS UP TO THE CAMERA, eyeing the vanishing car with intense suspicion: COLONEL NELEC. He then looks to the ground in front of him. CLOSE ON A FRESH, EMPTY YELLOW SUPER 8 FILM BOX. Nelec steps to it, picks it up. Looks at it. Then back up at the disappearing car. We PUSH IN ON HIS BURNING EYES AND. RRRRRRRROOOOOOOOOAAAAAARRRRRRRR! The Buick speeds past. Overlapping mayhem, but Charles obsesses over his camera.",
    "1357": "MILITARY TRUCKS, TENTS and SOLDIERS. HELICOPTERS buzz in the distant sky. Joe moves over to Alice, who looks out at the crash. CLOSE ON JOE as he arrives beside Alice, who looks out at the train, haunted. Joe stops reloading the gun, looks out, gets lost as well. Martin has arrives there too. Preston too. Joe moves the camera back to Alice -- he looks through the lens -- uses the ZOOM -- and WE SEE JOE'S POV -- the CRASH, ZOOMED IN -- he PANS from ONE CAR TO ANOTHER. Alice watches Joe, who peers into the camera for a long beat, finally standing up, looking out at the crash. The kids sit at a table at the window. The CAR LOT is across the street. They're talking excitedly but quietly. A WAITRESS is there, delivering more FOOD. Cary smiles at Alice. This lands for Joe -- for all of them -- as we CUT TO. The massive train wreck that goes on for a mile. Hundreds of MILITARY work to clean up fast. A truck DRIVES PAST CAMERA, taking us to Jack and Nelec, who WALK together amid the debris. Jack looks at Nelec -- not quite believing him. Jack is with Sheriff Pruitt, who stands, distracted, picking up reports from his desk, on his way out. Pruitt walks off. Jack, unsettled, watches him go. FINGERS TAPPING -- they're fingers on a COUNTER, a WALKMAN sitting beside them. BOOM UP to 23-year-old BREEN, who digs the BLONDIE he's listening to. He is alone in the station store. Behind him, 60-year-old SHERIFF PRUITT enters. The sheriff throws a candy bar at him. Breen pulls off the headphones. He exits the store. Charles is suddenly there, with Cary. Gnarly! Charles and Cary head off, planning the explosions. Alice looks at him knowingly. Alice considers this -- then, after a beat, starts doing her best zombie. Joe smiles, `cause it's pretty good. And Alice slowly leans in toward him -- is this performance? Or is this something else--? And she PUTS HER MOUTH ON HIS NECK IN A FAKE BITE, which makes Joe go still -- a shiver down his spine -- he's never felt anything like this in his life. And when she pulls back, her performance over, she's smiling. We're NEAR THE GAS PUMPS, LOW TO THE GROUND -- DOLLY as Jack, EDIE and MR. BLAKELY come out here.

    "1360": "Nelec moves to the door, he remains facing camera, his back to Woodward, as Overmyer moves to the bed. Push in on Nelec's face, understanding his true nature. Joe sleeps, power still out. Then, a knock. He wakes up. Another knock. His window. He moves to it. Opens it. Joe is half asleep, but also stunned. Very quietly. And Alice climbs in. Joe sits on the floor. Alice does too. It's odd and silent for a moment. Joe stares, amazed at her. And the power returns -- Joe's clock light goes on behind him -- but more chilling, the projector comes back on; the silent home movie of his mother plays. Joe crawls to the projector to stop it -- but. Alice moves closer to the screen. Joe sits behind her. She watches the film. Can't take her eyes away. A tear drops down Alice's face, though Joe can't see that. Finally, quietly. Watching his mother, Joe is quietly stunned. Just then, the Super 8 movie ends: the film flipflipflips. Joe turns off the projector -- but a sound remains. A sort of shudder-hum. Then they look: the shuddering is coming from the cube he took from the crash site, sitting on his desk. Joe and Alice move to it. The cube vibrates, almost imperceptibly. Joe opens a drawer, grabs a paintbrush -- he touches the cube -- the thing shudders on its own. They are amazed. They get low -- eyes at desk level -- the shuddering increases in pitch and volume -- he reaches out to touch it with his finger, but suddenly the cube bullets away -- five-inch hole in the wall! She screams -- they both fall to the floor, stunned -- push in on Joe, his heart pounding. He moves to the wall -- looks through the hole: in the distance, trees and the town water tower. Alice enters the dark house quietly. She steps carefully toward her room, when. A tense beat, her mind races. Breathe, Alice, just breathe. This kills her -- but she does: she leaves the house. Alice, crying, gets on her bike and rides off -- a distant fiery glow past the factory and over the hills. The front door opens -- Louis comes out and yells, miserable. But she's far gone -- Louis' mind races -- he runs to his Buick -- starts it up -- pulls out fast and goes after her. Alice pedals hard, she wants to escape everywhere. A block behind her, screech: a car turns onto the road. Her father's car -- she makes a turn. We're with Louis as he drives -- clearly drunk. Alice makes a daring stop -- turns back up the hill, pedals hard, crying and hyperventilating.",

She tries to deep throat it. Pete loves it. Pete and Debbie drive back from Laguna. They could not look happier or more refreshed. They hold hands and smile at each other. They pull up to their house, shut off the car and sit for a beat, knowing they're about to head back into the stress of the real world, not wanting their peaceful, loving time to end. Sadie walks outside. Jodi follows her. Charlotte is crying really hard. Charlotte sits on the table. Pete and Debbie are talking to DR. SEDUKU, a foreign doctor. Dr. Seduku has both an accent and a lisp. Pete cycles with the crew. Debbie looks around the house for Pete. Debbie sees Pete on the bed, his legs up in the air. He still has his bike top on but is naked from the waist down. He is trying to look at his back end. He is holding a mirror and an iPhone. Pete has his naked legs hiked up over his head. Debbie takes a very quick glance inside. Debbie talks to Jodi while they fold clothes and watch Desi. Debbie walks over to Desi. Desi picks a shirt. Desi begins to take all her clothes off in front of Debbie. Debbie squeezes Desi's breasts. Pete talks is in his office on the phone with his REALTOR. Sadie and her friend WENDY run around the yard with Charlotte and the triplets. Larry and Debbie greet the kids when they enter the kitchen. Larry picks up one of the triplets. Charlotte leaves with the triplets. Larry takes some of the food she's throwing out. Wendy exits. Sadie runs off. Pete enters from the hallway. He sees Larry and turns around before anyone notices him. Pete and Debbie are in bed. Pete is reading Sadie's iChats on her confiscated iPad out loud to Debbie. They hear a door slam. Debbie gasps. Debbie starts looking through the iPad. Pete's iPhone chimes. He sees a message from Ronnie from work. He looks over at Debbie who is oblivious. Pete paces. Pete is driving. Sadie and Charlotte sing show tunes loudly and happily. Pete is very upset about the record not selling. Debbie is talking to their ACCOUNTANT. Pete enters and walks into Ronnie's office. Ronnie is drawing on a blackboard behind his desk. Pete walks out of Ronnie's office and into the main office space. Ronnie follows. Debbie sits in Dr. Pelligrino's office. Debbie drives. We cannot tell what she is feeling. Then after a few beats, a joyous smile appears across her face.",
    "137": "Again the darkness of the ill-lit station and the angle of the camera limit our vision. The sergeant is on the low sloping roof of the station. The captain turns briskly to two of his detail. He turns his head slowly, his mouth agape at His point of view. The whole of the obscurely lit platform is covered thick with waiting crowds. They engulf the station house, back and front, and on the other side of the train more people are packed all along its length, and beyond them along the narrow street that stretches through the little collection of houses adjoining the station, every rooftop is covered -- men, women with babes in arms, children. He has stepped down from the train. Shukla guides him, Ba and Charlie a step or two behind. Gandhi moves through the silent crowd, his hands in the pranam, bowing a little to either side. As he advances, the crowd parts -- it is almost eerily silent. As their clothes indicate, the area is Muslim, so some salaam (a touch of the hand to the forehead) and a few tentatively make the pranam back to Gandhi as he moves through them. Most of the faces are gaunt and lean. And suddenly there is a commotion and the sound of boots on the concrete platform, and the English captain shoves his way through to confront Gandhi down the little aisle that was being made for him. The sergeant and part of the detail and behind the captain. The captain stares. Then he looks around at the crowd, suspiciously, a touch of inner fear, then back to Gandhi. There is a flicker of recognition, but uncertain. Another glance at the crowd, this time with an air of outraged authority. It has the cold assurance of a lawyer, and the Captain is a little shaken by it. He glances at Charlie who stands behind Gandhi now, and it makes him all the more uncertain. He tries to make it severe, but it is a comedown. It is firm and there is an edge of assertiveness to it that the Captain doesn't like, but Gandhi's unrelenting stare unnerves him. He glances at Charlie again. Again, the empty severity of weakness. He looks around, then turns and marches off briskly shoving his way through the crowd. Where all was silence before there is now the hum of excitement. Already he has scored a victory -- and as he moves forward again, making the pranam, they return it with flushed greetings. The early light of the sun illumines the dwelling. We feature a man in middle age, but one who looks ill and drawn (Meha). He lies on a straw mat.",
    "1370": "Sadie sits alone watching Lost on an iPad. Debbie rests next to Charlotte in bed. Pete is sleeping on the couch. Pete sits at the counter. Debbie and the kids are at the breakfast table. Pete is driving Sadie and Charlotte to school. Pete is eating an egg sandwich and manically singing along. Pete walks Charlotte in. He gives her a kiss then walks back towards his car. On the way he bumps into Joseph and his mom. Pete thinks for a moment, not sure how to handle this. He pokes her shoulder. Debbie is talking to Jodi, who is crying. Debbie's phone buzzes. Pete and Debbie are sitting across from VICE PRINCIPAL LAVIANI. In another seat is Joseph's mother, Catherine. Debbie tries to hide a smile. Pete and Debbie leave the school together, surpressing smiles. They get in separate cars and drive off. Debbie is making dinner. Pete and Charlotte sit at the table. She walks off. Sadie does her homework on her bed. Charlotte brings in Sadie's electronics and puts them down in a pile beside her. Charlotte walks away and starts to slide the door closed behind her. Debbie is sitting on the couch. Pete paces around the room. They hug. The shades are closed and the room is dark. Sadie watches the end of the last episode of Lost on a laptop. Pete enters. Debbie is speaking with Barb as they set up the kitchen for a barbecue for Pete's fortieth birthday. Desi jumps in the pool in a small bikini. She is playing in the water with the kids. Angle on Barb and Debbie. Angle on Barry and Pete. Angle on Barb and Debbie. Barry and Pete turn toward their wives, smile and wave. Pete greets guests, including Graham and Grandma Molly. Pete and Ronnie are talking in the backyard. Debbie walks over with Jason. They leave Ronnie and Jason alone. The guys spot Desi swimming in the pool. Debbie and Pete open the front door. Standing there is Oliver. He gives a nervous smile. Debbie looks at him and tries to be nice, but we feel her effort. She opens the door wider. They do not hug. He hands him a bottle. The party is in full swing. Pete, Debbie, Oliver, Barry and Barb are getting food from the buffet. Barb and Barry are trying to help keep the conversation going. Larry arrives, with Claire and the triplets. Claire is holding two of them, while Larry carries one. Larry lifts one of the triplets up and down by the arms, simulating an elevator. Larry puts Jack down and he runs off. Claire runs off. Sadie, Charlotte and Desi walk over. He gives Desi a hug.",
    "1371": "Oliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver follows. Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous. She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each other and come to the surface. Desi swims away. Larry is talking to Oliver. Oliver smiles, amused. Jason and Ronnie are talking to Desi. Debbie, Pete, Larry, Oliver, Barb and Barry are eating. Ronnie, Jason, and Desi talk. Oliver gets up to leave. Oliver walks out. The party is tense. Debbie looks over and sees that Oliver never actually left. He stands in the back looking uncomfortable, quietly singing. She's shocked he's still there. Debbie smokes a cigarette at the side of the house. Sadie appears. Debbie turns, caught. She walks away towards the house. Sadie follows. Sadie storms through the front door after Debbie. Debbie keeps walking down the hall. Sadie follows her. Barb is in the kitchen with Pete and Charlotte. Debbie turns the corner to find Pete standing in front of the fridge, stress eating. Debbie storms off back towards the foyer. Larry pops out from the living room, stopping Debbie in the foyer. Claire and the triplets are right behind him. Pete throws his cupcake against the wall. Larry and Claire walk away as Pete storms in. Oliver passes Pete and turns to Debbie as Pete walks away. Debbie is stunned. Debbie follows him out the door and onto the front porch. She closes the door behind them. Debbie looks at him for a moment. Larry opens the door and peeks out. We reveal that everyone at the party (except Pete) is still standing in the foyer. From the side of the house we see Pete storming by on his bike, wearing his street clothes and a helmet. Pete exits his home riding his bike. He is very angry. He rides with great emotion like he is trying to get all the frustration out of his body. Pete rides his bike onto San Vicente Boulevard. Pete rides down the street. A CAR passes by him. When it does a fifteen-year-old TEENAGER sticks his head out the window and yells to scare Pete. Pete almost falls. Debbie and Barb are cleaning up. They look out the window to see Oliver picking up glasses and putting them in a bin. Sadie walks in with Joseph. Sadie walks off. Joseph follows. A car honks when traffic clogs up behind him. A car makes a right turn, and Pete almost rides right into it. He pulls up alongside Jason's van. Desi is riding with Jason. They speed off. Oliver and the kids are playing with an iPhone. Debbie walks outside. Debbie exits.",
    "1373": "Harry, Ron and Hermione are seated on a train. Cho Chan walks up to the trolley. Harry and Cho look at each other and smile. Ron sees he hasn't enough money. Hermione sees Harry rubbing his head. Suddenly they are fired on. Arthur and others approach. The lady appears at their door. We see four flying horses flying through the air pulling a carriage coming in to land at Hogwarts. A large ship emerges from under the water and approaches too. The crowds cheer. A man runs up the aisle limping in a comical way, he whispers something to Dumbledore and leaves in the same fashion. A group of girls dressed in blue dance up the aisle and release butterflies into the air. They bow and everyone applauds. A series of older boys walk up the aisle brandishing bo staffs, twirling them around and periodically stabbing them into the ground with a spark effect. The boys breathe some fire. They embrace. The man seated next to Hagrid yelps. Hagrid has stabbed a fork into his hand. A strange man stands in the doorway, he casts some magic upwards and seals the roof. Peace is restored. This character enters the room and begins walking. He see Harry through his mechanical eye. He limps, breathing heavily as he goes. The crowd is unsettled, people are booing. Dumbledore casts magic over a box which melds into a goblet containing a blue flame. We see a suspicious character enter the room where the goblet is still burning and close the door behind him. He writes his name on the board. Mad-Eye throws the chalk in anger. Mad-Eye pops open a jar with a spider in it. He uses his wand to send it around the class. The class is unsettled. Draco laughs. Mad-Eye sends the spider onto Draco's face. Mad-Eye has the spider over a bucket of water, it's wriggling. Neville Longbottom stands. Mad-Eye begins torturing the spider with magic, it squeals. Mad-Eye stops. Neville is disturbed. Mad-Eye picks up the spider which is still making a noise. Hermione shakes her head. He casts a spell and the spider disintegrates. He approaches Harry's desk and takes a drink. They see a boy on the stairs facing the window. Mad-Eye approaches Neville and pats him on the shoulder. Neville nods. Older students are placing their names into the flame and others are applauding, Cedric is one of them. The twins come up cheering. They jump inside the age line, and cheer. They put their names in the flame and do a high-five. The flame fires up and they're flung across the room onto the floor. When they get up they have full heads of grey hair and beards.",
    "1377": "Harry frees Ron. Cedric and Cho emerge, the crowd cheers. Viktor and Hermione next, the crowd chants 'Krum, Krum, Krum'. The Beauxbatons girls look worried. Harry looks over and sees the blonde girl that Fleur was unable to rescue. He loosens her rope too and starts heading for the surface with the both of them. He's attacked and gets held down, he pushes Ron and the girl towards the surface. Ron and the girl come up, they are coughing but safe. They're helped out of the water by a girl from Beauxbatons. Underwater Harry casts a spell which propels him towards the surface, he flies out and lands on the decking where the crowd are. Fleur kisses Harry on the face. Fleur kisses him too. Hermione kisses Harry on the head. Cedric and his friends cheer. As they're walking away from the lake Harry's friends are cheering him. Barty Crouch is waiting for Harry. Mad-Eye approaches them. Barty walks away from him. Harry holds his head in pain. On the ground he sees Barty Crouch laying lifeless. Mad-Eye points to the door. Harry enters. Harry is left alone in the room. He puts his hand in the snackbowl and takes a handful. It turns into a small creature which nips at his hand. The man seated next to Dumbledore speaks. Dumbledore and the man shake hands. Their handshake goes through Harry's body, he appears to be some kind of ghost with no presence. Proceedings begin, a cage is raised from inside the floor. Igor protests loudly. Barty hits the gavel repeatedly. Barty Crouch junior begins to run. Mad-Eye zaps him with magic, he falls into the center of the court. The crowd is in uproar. Guards seize Barty junior. Dumbledore puts up his wand and pulls a quivering string of magic out from his head. The door opens and they see Harry. He looks at them. Igor leaves. Severus closes the door in Harry's face. The champions emerge. The crowd cheer on hearing his name. The Bulgarian crowd go nuts. The cannon goes off. Mr Filch shrugs comically. Dumbledore groans. Harry and Cedric enter the maze through different entrances. The entrance closes up behind Harry. Heavy mist sets in, we pan out to see the maze is many stories tall. Cedric is walking along, the maze walls begin to close in on him. He makes a run for it. Fleur is running around scared, she is attacked and knocked down. Viktor comes along and sees she's unconscious on the ground, he walks on. Harry sees Fleur being swallowed into the undergrowth. He's too late she's disappeared. He sends up a red spark into the air. A heavy wind starts blowing, walls are closing in, Harry runs.",
    "1379": "The tent blooms softly with light, briefly illuminating a bedside photograph of James and Lily Potter, then goes dark. The blankets bloom once again when, down the hall, a toilet flushes. Instantly, the shadow stiffens, the blankets dim, and the tent flattens. Just as the bedroom door opens, revealing Uncle Vernon. He peers inside, eyes flashing suspiciously, then withdraws. The tent rises. As the blankets blaze, we cut inside, find a skinny boy with a crow's nest of black hair, thick glasses sitting crookedly atop his nose: Harry Potter. Open before him is Violeta Stitch's Extreme Incantations. Once again, he speaks. A blinding blast of light flashes from the second story window of Number Four. The light in the hallway snaps on, Harry's tent droops once more and, seconds later, Harry's door eases open. Uncle Vernon peers in and switches on the light. Slowly, he closes the door. Uncle Vernon eyes the parchment in Harry's hand suspiciously. Just then Dudley, sitting comatose before the TV, emits a hollow, brain-dead chuckle. Marge flashes a thick fan of pound notes. Dudley blinks, waddles forward, and extends his plump palm obediently. Harry looks on, then sees Ripper snuffling about his ankle. As Harry clears the dishes, Uncle Vernon brings out a bottle of brandy. Hearing this, Harry frowns, glances at Uncle Vernon, who glares darkly at him. Aunt Marge pauses on her wine, eyes narrowing on Harry. Pop! The glass in Aunt Marge's hand explodes. Harry stares at the shattered glass in surprise. Aunt Marge starts to reply, when -- zing! -- a button on her dress sails into the air. Thread snaps. Aunt Marge's eyes widen. Her cheeks billow. Her whole body billows. And she begins to inflate like a monstrous balloon. To his horror, Uncle Vernon himself begins to rise. Aunt Marge looks fearfully into his eyes. He lets go. Falls to his knees. And watches Aunt Marge float away. Harry crashes inside, takes his trunk, then puts his heel to a loose floorboard and removes his wand from its hiding place. Turning, he grabs the photograph of his parents. Boom! Boom! Boom! Harry tows the trunk down the stairs. Finds Uncle Vernon waiting for him. Uncle Vernon eyes Harry's wand nervously, then grins with knowing cruelty. As Harry storms out with his trunk, we dolly to the street with him. High in the sky, a plump dot rises. Harry walks and walks and walks, then stops. Glances about. An empty playground. Swings creaking gently on rusted chains. A tiny carousel, kissed gently by the wind, turning slowly. Harry drops the trunk. Sits. Harry, still as a statue. In the trees above, leaves tremble. Harry turns, studies the swaying swings, the carousel.",
    "138": "Gandhi sits cross-legged, listening. It is the kind of listening that opens the heart. Behind him a mass of villagers sits stoically, outside the dwelling, waiting while their case is heard. Meha tries to speak unemotionally but under Gandhi's sympathetic gaze his despair keeps cracking through. Near to breakdown, he gestures around the empty house. He cannot go on. Meha nods. Gandhi looks around the crude dwelling, almost nothing remains. We see two young men, one seventeen perhaps, the other older, and a girl, sixteen. And finally Meha's wife, sitting near Ba, the two women listening together but Meha's wife looks like a woman who has given up, her hair is dead and hardly combed, her sari dirty. Gandhi nods. The words are said bleakly, not to raise false hopes. He glances at Meha's wife. Water comes to her eyes, and she lowers her head. Ba puts her hands on her shoulders and clasps her to her, and the woman breaks, and sobs and sobs. Gandhi rides on an open howdah on an elephant, his mind locked in sober reflection. Shukla shares the howdah with him, but does not dare break Gandhi's black mood. It contains more anger than we have seen him display to anyone but Ba. A ball is hit. The camera pulls back to reveal a lush, verdant pitch, white-garbed players, English, a few ladies dressed in First World War fashion watching under parasols near the clubhouse and in the shade of trees with a few officers and civil servants, while Indian servants discreetly serve cool drinks. The batsman has hit a four and we see him run down the pitch with his partner until the four is certain, then. The wicket keeper makes a rude, facetious gesture, but as the batsman turns to settle in his crease again. He has looked up. A car is pulling hurriedly in near the clubhouse, an officer in it, and people are streaming toward it. A major is standing on the back seat. An Indian corporal drives. The captain looks at his clerical collar, his English face, his determination. He looks down at Gandhi and shakes his head. And now we see Gandhi in full shot for the first time. He is wearing only a white loincloth, the shawl over his shoulders and sandals -- the costume he will wear for the rest of his life. Charlie studies him a moment, and being Charlie, he understands. He grins, and it elicits a little grin from Gandhi. And Gandhi laughs. And again Gandhi laughs. Charlie turns to the guard. The police guard hesitates, and then unlocks the cell. Charlie enters and sits on a little wooden stool opposite Gandhi, his long legs awkwardly filling most of the space between them.",
    "1381": "As Ron and Harry exchange a curious glance, the BELL continues to CHIME -- DING! DING! -- and at this point, the TIME REVERSAL ends and the room is Empty, except for Harry and Hermione. As Hermione unloops the necklace, Harry glances around in confusion. Hermione ignores the question, eyes the CLOCK on the wall. Hermione grabs Harry's arm, slams through the door. Harry and Hermione come to a mad, huffing halt. She holds up a hand, silencing him. Annoyed, Harry follows her gaze and BLINKS in DISBELIEF. He sees himself, along with Hermione and Ron, about to confront Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle near the monoliths. Dumbfounded, Harry turns. Hermione holds up the HOURGLASS. A soft SMACK is HEARD. They turn, see Malfoy land on the seat of his pants in the Sundial Garden, rub his kisser. Hermione pulls Harry under the bridge. Seconds later, FOOTSTEPS CLAMOR over their heads. Seconds later, Harry emerges, marvels at the sight of himself and Hermione, and Ron heading down the slope to Hagrid's hut. His eyes shift to the pumpkin patch. Harry nods, then looks toward the hut. Inside, Hagrid is handing Scabbers to Ron. As he starts to rise, Hermione grabs him, speaks fiercely. Hermione turns, watches Fudge and the others drawing closer. She frowns, glances into the hut. Just then on the ground beside her Hermione notices a JAGGED STAR-SHAPED STONE. Instantly, she grabs it, rises, and hurls it through the OPEN WINDOW. SMASH! The sound of a GLASS JAR SHATTERING is heard within the hut. Hermione ignores him, swiftly whistling a second stone through the window and -- CONK! -- off the back of Harry's head. Crows begin to drop atop the roof. Fudge's party arrives, RAPS on the door. Harry and Hermione watch themselves start up the slope. The coast clear, they slip out of the trees. As Harry vaults into the patch, the CROWS STIR, CAWING at his ankles, pecking at his feet. Buckbeak refuses to move. Harry and Hermione shoo Buckbeak along, disappear into the forest, just as Dumbledore concludes his reverie. Harry and Hermione -- their view unobstructed by the LOW STAND OF TREES this time -- watch the Executioner approach the pumpkin patch. Quickly, the confusion in his masked eyes turns to anger. The Executioner lifts his blade and -- with a brutal fury -- plunges it into the flesh of a PUMPKIN with a SICKENING CHOP. The CROWS SCATTER to the skies. Harry and Hermione race through the trees as Buckbeak lopes easily behind. SUBJECTIVE POV, GLIDING THROUGH a thicket of trees, TO the forest's edge, the trees thinning, REVEALING the Whomping Willow THRASHING. Hermione disappears down the hole, then a FIGURE approaches the tree, Lupin.",
    "1384": "Then Fudge turns. Harry glances warily from the steaming TUREEN of GREEN to Tom, who works a grimy thumb into his gum, frees a walnut sliver. Fudge smiles nervously. Harry eyes the STACK of BOOKS. One is bound by a ROPE. THROUGH the window: the rooftops of London. A TRAIN PASSES and CAMERA PULLS BACK, REVEALS Harry, standing with Hedwig. He turns, eyes his schoolbooks. He studies the GROWLING TOME -- The Monster Book of Monsters -- then gives the rope a tug. Instantly the book LEAPS to the floor, pages flying, bookcovers SNAPPING. Harry gives chase, then the book turns, begins NIPPING viciously at his shoes. Harry vaults atop the bed, watches the book disappear underneath, then grabs a pillow. Seconds later, the book scuttles into view and Harry POUNCES -- FLUMPH! The BOOK ROARS angrily, muffled beneath the pillow. A YOUNG WITCH in maid's robes pushes a cart down the hall. Harry exits his room as the witch KNOCKS on a door. As she opens the door, she's greeted by a THUNDEROUS ROAR and a RUSH of WIND. Something SMALL and FAST dashes by Harry's feet. Looking, he spies a rather ragged-looking RAT (SCABBERS), pursued by a decidedly UGLY ORANGE CAT (CROOKSHANKS). As Harry moves down the stairs, VOICES come from below. As Harry reaches bottom, he finds RON WEASLEY protectively cradling Scabbers, while HERMIONE GRANDER does her best to restrain a HISSING Crookshanks. Then, sensing another presence in the room, both turn. In the accompanying PHOTO, the entire WEASLEY FAMILY stands before the GREAT PYRAMIDS, waving. Smack in the middle is Ron, Scabbers perched on his shoulder. Mrs. Weasley takes Harry's face in her hands, smiles. Harry's eyes drift to the fugitive poster. Mr. Weasley hesitates, unable to continue. Mr. Weasley hesitates yet again. She points. Just then, the COMPARTMENT RATTLES. Lanterns flicker. The train LURCHES, begins to SLOW. Harry rises, slides open the door, peers into the corridor. HARRY'S POV -- All along the carriage, HEADS look out curiously. Then -- the train JERKS -- the car SWAYS -- and the LAMPS running along the ceiling FLICKER and die. A thin WISP of STEAM escapes Ron's mouth. Ron, a dark silhouette against the window, wipes a patch of condensation from the window. Suddenly the CAR SWAYS violently. from the stick in the hands of R.J. Lupin comes out a SHIVERING LIGHT, his face looks tired and gray, but his eyes are alert, Wary. Hermione's troubled face hovers above him. Sits up. Ron -- pale, nervous -- extends his hand. Harry's glasses. As he leaves, Harry turns to Ron and Hermione. She shakes her head. Harry looks to the window and we PUSH IN ON his REFLECTION.",
    "1385": "It becomes a glimmering puddle and omitted. Splash! a carriage wheel shatters the glassy surface as we tilt up, catch a procession of horseless carriages, carrying students toward the glimmering castle. Gradually, the sweet sound of a choir rises on the air, a flash of lightning bleaches the night sky and we cut to Great Hall. The camera as it glides toward the windows of the Great Hall, toward the candelit silhouettes glimmering within, passing through the glass. At the High Table, Lupin sits with Severus Snape, Minerva McGonagall, Rubeus Hagrid and Albus Dumbledore. We track along the faces of the choir, singing to the strains of a harpsichord, and land on a quintet of toads (one of which -- Trevor -- belongs to Neville Longbottom, who looks on with pride). As the choir's song concludes, Dumbledore rises, beaming over the sea of black hats. Amid scattered applause, Harry, Ron, Hermione clap. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stare at each other -- stunned -- then applaud vigorously. Hagrid turns ruby red, rises, and nearly topples the staff table, sending water goblets weaving. At the Slytherin table, Draco Malfoy, flanked by the ever-present Crabbe and Goyle, catches Harry's eye, feigns a dead faint. Students exit the Great Hall, scale the Marble Staircase. Harry, Ron and Hermione arrive at the seventh floor landing and approach the Fat Lady in the portrait. Ron spins. Frowns at Hermione. Professor Trelawney takes the cup, peers inside, and grasps. All turn, see Lavender bent over her textbook. Harry peers into his cup. The tea leaves shift. The trio emerge from the bridge and make their way toward Hagrid's hut. Students gather around Hagrid as Harry, Ron and Hermione arrive. Draco, Crabbe, and Goyle stand with the Slytherins. There seems no consensus on this, but the students stare in wary wonder nonetheless. As Hagrid coaxes the beast to the center of the paddock, Ron stares uneasily. The entire class steps back, leaving Harry in front. Unsure, Harry nods anyway. Steps forward. And bows. Buckbeak's head cocks, eagle eyes studying Harry cannily. Harry starts to step back, when. Buckbeak ducks his beak. Hagrid sighs, relieved. Tentatively, Harry reaches out, lays his hand on Buckbeak's fierce beak. The class claps. Harry smiles. Hagrid lifts Harry high, drops him onto Buckbeak's back, and before Harry's settled, slaps Buckbeak's hindquarters. In a flash, Buckbeak's steely talons slash down. Malfoy freezes. Looks down at the blood blossoming on his robes. Shrieks. Instantly, Harry dashes forward. Buckbeak whips around, raises its talons and -- seeing Harry -- lowers them. Ducks its beak. Breathes. Harry, Ron and Hermione watch from the Gryffindor table. They turn. Seamus and the other Gryffindors are huddled over a copy of The Daily Prophet.",
    "14": "Lester stands at the bar. A bartender pours him a drink. The bartender complies. Lester takes his drink and turns to face the center of the room. Carolyn is talking to Buddy and Christy. She's on: smiling, animated, LAUGHING too loud at their jokes. Lester shakes his head. Ricky approaches him, wearing a waiter's uniform, carrying a tray of empty glasses. Lester looks away, scans the crowd, then downs the rest of his drink in one gulp. Ricky just stands there, watching him. Finally Lester turns back to Ricky: what does this kid want. Lester's surprised, but instantly intrigued. Carolyn and Buddy are deep in conversation. Christy has wandered off. Carolyn is nervous; Buddy seems amused. They look at each other for a beat, then look away. This situation is loaded and they both know it. Ricky and Lester stand next to a dumpster behind the service entrance to the hotel, smoking a JOINT. Suddenly, the service entrance opens, and a large CATERING BOSS in a cheap suit peers out at them. Ricky hides the joint. He goes back inside. Lester looks at Ricky, who shrugs. Carolyn is standing in the open service entrance. Lester quickly hides the joint behind his back. And she goes back inside. Jane and Angela are watching MTV. Jane switches off the TV. She starts toward the kitchen. Lester enters and opens the refrigerator. He turns, and is instantly transfixed by: Angela leans against the counter, twirling her hair. She starts toward him. She reaches inside the refrigerator to grab a bottle. EXTREME CLOSE UP on her hand as it briefly touches his shoulder in SLOW MOTION. As she does, she moves to place her other hand casually on Lester's shoulder. He sees it coming. Everything SLOWS DOWN, and all sound FADES. CLOSE on Lester: his eyes narrow slightly, then: He cups her face in his hands and kisses her. She seems shocked, but doesn't resist as he pulls her toward him with surprising strength. He breaks the kiss, looking at her in awe, then he reaches up and touches his lips. His eyes widen as he pulls a ROSE PETAL from his mouth right before we. Jane glances at Angela, irritated. Angela is back against the counter, drinking the root beer. Carolyn enters from the dining room. He can't believe what he's hearing. Lester, still in his suit, stands outside Jane's room, his ear up against the door. He knows this persona well, only it's never pissed him off as much as it does right now. And he kisses her--a soft, warm kiss that speaks unmistakably of sex--then turns to the others and grins. Carolyn's smile is frozen on her face. He crosses off.",

Godse moves his right hand rapidly from the stance of prayer to his jacket, in an instant -- it holds a gun, and he fires point blank at Gandhi -- loud, startling -- once, twice, thrice. Gandhi's white shawl is stained with blood as he falls. Amid the screams and sounds of chaos we dissolve through to. Soldier's feet moving in the slow step, half-step, step of the requiem march. The huge funeral procession -- crowds such as have never been seen on the screen massed along the route. People everywhere, clinging to monuments, lamp standards, trees -- and as the camera pulls back from the funeral cortege it reveals more and more. We only hear a strange, rhythmic shuffling, pierced by an occasional wail of grief. We see the soldiers and sailors lining the route, their hands locked together in one seemingly endless chain. We see the two hundred men of the Army, Navy and Air Force drawing the Army weapon-carrier that bears the body of Gandhi. And finally we see Gandhi lying on the weapon-carrier, surrounded by flowers, a tiny figure in this ocean of grief and reverence. Commentators from all over the world are covering the ceremony. We concentrate on one, let us say the most distinguished American broadcaster of the time, Edward R. As the cortege continues on its way, we get shots of the marching soldiers, of the faces of Sikhs, and Tamils, Anglo-Indians, Moslems from the north, Marathas from the south, blue-eyed Parsees, dark-skinned Keralans. We see the throng, following the weapon-carrier bier of Gandhi as it slowly inches its way along the Kings way. Mountbatten, tall, handsome, bemedalled, walks at the head of dignitaries from many lands. and behind them a broad mass of Indians. The camera picks out those who ride on the weapon-carrier with Gandhi's body. the stout, blunt, but now shattered Patel, Gandhi's son, Devadas, the strong, almost fierce face of Maulana Azad, now angry at the Gods themselves. and finally Pandit Nehru -- a face with the strength of a hero, the sensitivity of a poet, and now wounded like the son of a loving father. The porter has glanced down the corridor, where from his point of view we can just glimpse the European talking with the conductor. He looks up suddenly then turns back quickly to his work. Gandhi glances at the door to see what has frightened him so. The European and the conductor push open the door and stride in. Gandhi is incredulous that he is being addressed in such a manner.",
    "141": "Sir George is staring out of the window, vexed, bristling but defensive. He picks up one of the papers irritatedly, the London Daily Chronicle. Sir George looks at him and sighs heavily. Sir Edward stares back, then drops the paper back on his desk. Sir George looks from him to Sir Edward. Sir George looks at the document on the secretary's desk. The secretary turns it slowly so it is facing him. Sir George looks at it like a snake. The secretary picks up a pen and offers it. A second, then Sir George takes the pen and signs angrily. Sir Edward is at the liquor cabinet. He turns, offering Sir George a whiskey in a finely cut glass of crystal. Gandhi grins, dismissing the formality. Again Gandhi grins at the extravagance. A polite little laugh; Jinnah introduces him. Gandhi makes the pranam, studying him with interest after that comment. Azad gives a gentle salaam. Gandhi turns. He stands, awaiting Gandhi's attention. All the others have been dressed in European clothes. The handsome Europeanized Nehru now wears an Indian tunic -- much like the one that Gandhi once wore. For a moment Gandhi studies the costume, then a broad smile. He looks at Gandhi. Again the temper of it produces a little silence. He moves to a servant who stands, holding a large tray with a silver service of tea. Of them all, Nehru's manner is the most naturally patrician and Jinnah watches him with a somewhat envious awareness of it. His stand has produced a little shock of surprise. Holding his tea, he turns to Gandhi with a little smile. They all look at him with some surprise. As he speaks, he rises and walks to the servant. They all stare at him, startled by his words and the fervor with which he speaks to them. He holds their gaze, then turns to the immobile servant and with a little smile, takes the tray from him and places it on the table next to him. As it sinks in, Gandhi pours some tea then looks up at them with a pleading warmth -- first to Jinnah. It impresses each one of them. But for all his impact, they still take the measure of him with caution. Patel is the first to recognize the implications. The idea has caught hold. Lord Chelmsford turns expectantly. His firmness doesn't restore Kinnoch's normal aplomb. He holds the telegrams forward. He glances at the general. That takes the wind out of all of them. Grimly, Lord Chelmsford looks out across the palace's ordered lawns and gardens. A prison door opens. Gandhi, in prison clothes, is led along a small corridor to a room. The door is held open by a prison guard.",
    "142": "Nehru waits for Gandhi. He rises when Gandhi enters. The guard signals Gandhi to a chair across a small wooden table from Nehru. The guard closes the door, but remains in the room. Nehru's face is a map of concern, but he manages a small smile of greeting. Gandhi, who also looks worn, rises his eyebrows whimsically at the use of that name. Gandhi sighs, and their faces and minds go to more somber matters. Gandhi has listened to it all with a growing sense of despair. The golden dome of the Temple fills the screen, shimmering. The sound of a car, and marching feet. The camera pulls back from the dome, revealing the rooftops, the trees and then suddenly, center of frame, the face of General Dyer -- blunt, cold, isolated in a cocoon of vengeful military righteousness. He is traveling slowly, steadily in an armored car at the head of fifty armed sepoys -- Gurkhas and Baluchis -- immaculate, precise, awesome. Behind them a staff car with Dyer's English ADC and a British police officer. It is a relentless, determined procession, filling the dusty street with a sense of menace and foreboding. A large public garden, enclosed by a thick, old, crumbling wall. A large crowd is gathered around a speaker on a platform at one side of the park. It is political, but the crowd is mixed. We see Muslims and Hindus, many of them Sikhs, old men, little children, women with babes in arms. We close in on the speaker -- a Muslim. He clutches a copy of Gandhi's journal. General Dyer, his armored car, his sepoys, moving toward the gate. Dyer looks ahead calmly. The Gate of the Bagh. A rickety double gate in the high crumbling wall. Nearer, a few vendors, loiterers and children. At the sound of the armored car and marching feet, a few turn in curiosity. The armored car grinds forward. It won't go through the gates, one fender scraping against the gate post. Dyer gives a quiet order, the car backs away. Dyer jumps down lightly -- a man in splendid condition. He walks through the gate and stands quietly in the at-ease position, hands clasping his swagger stick behind his back. Looking off at the speaker -- medium shot. Medium close -- the sepoys and Dyer. He issues his commands in a quiet and unemotional voice, as though they were on maneuvers. A ripple of panic now, everyone pressing back, but still they cannot credit what they see. Only one or two have the presence of mind to push clear and seek shelter. Close shot Dyer, still calm. Flash shot along the line of sepoys; the rifles jerk and bang.",
    "145": "They look at each other with a kind of fear a rampant crowd can excite in those who must hold it. The small train station near the ashram. Kallenbach stands by a new (early 1920s) Ford touring car, watching as a train pulls into the station. As people start to jump off the train he moves forward. Despite the Indian tunic he now wears he cannot help but look and act like the incisive, patrician lawyer he is under the skin. As he moves through the crowded platform. Kallenbach is smiling too. He reaches for the bags again. In the chaos of the Third Class we see Maulana Azad coming out of a section of the coach. He is carrying a baby wrapped in rags. The child's mother with two little ones hanging on her has followed him out. Azad hands the woman the baby and she obviously thanks him. He makes a little salaam to her and moves through the confusion of the platform toward the camera. Resume Patel and Kallenbach. Patel grins. Like most witty men, he loves wit in others. Patel groans. They turn back to the train and just as they do, the tall Indian woman in the red sari tips a porter, taking one small bag from him and turns: Mirabehn (Madeleine Slade) is tall, quite pretty and extremely English despite the sari. The minute she turns, she stops on seeing the now startled Kallenbach. The camera is on a row of sandals by the door -- Patel's, Azad's, Desai's, Gandhi's. It pans to the room. Gandhi sitting facing Patel and Azad, Desai in the background, making notes of the discussion. Gandhi is carding fiber to thread as they talk. Mirabehn, seated like the others, is almost in the circle, sitting near Ba, and listening like her. Ba's spinning never stops. Gandhi looks up at Azad, Azad shakes his head solemnly. But he does not go on. It has a terrible sobriety. Azad shakes his head. Gandhi reaches out and touches his hand. He holds Azad's eyes, giving strength. Then he turns to Mirabehn, made more aware of her by Azad's reference. For a moment he looks at her sari. Gandhi smiles approvingly. Then a shadow. Mirabehn beams. Mirabehn nods and looks resignedly at Ba. Ba is spinning. She smiles. Mirabehn looks at her, accepting the warmth behind the teasing. It is the beginning of an enduring friendship. A small town. Featuring the faces of six Indian police constables as a torch light parade passes them. There are enough of them in their group to be watching the marchers with a challenging disdain. The marchers are men in loin- clothes and tunics; they brandish torn and ripped English cloth and shout in unison.",
    "146": "Another angle. Some of the marchers turn at the shout. A few of the tail-enders watching, some running clear of the police, some being beaten. Two police have a man on the ground. One policeman looks up. Patel leans with one arm on a table, his mood as devastated as Gandhi's; he is looking at an Indian paper on the table by his hand. It is a New York Times and we just glimpse the picture of the severed head lying in the smoldering ashes. And now we see Nehru and Azad in the background too. And Desai. Jinnah as usual in a finely cut European suit, the others are dressed in tunics of homespun as they will be to the end. They turn to him -- a sense of surprise, but they don't really believe he means the statement. He looks at him. Patel looks up hopelessly at Jinnah. Azad keeps his eyes fixed on Gandhi, sensing, fearing what is going to happen. He looks at Gandhi with a mounting sense of annoyance. Gandhi is listening, but still withdrawn into himself. Jinnah turns away in anger. Patel sighs. Nehru feels helpless but he continues to try. Gandhi stares into nothing -- mulling that. Finally. Nehru stares at him -- surprised. And Nehru ignores the thought too, because like Azad his mind is already on the real danger. Gandhi looks up at him -- a resigned fatalism. Mirabehn walks across the grounds toward Gandhi's bungalow. She carries a small tray with a pitcher and a glass. We see a few people working in the background, and a mass of people camped near the entrance, some sprawled, some sitting, some standing -- all waiting. The steps of Gandhi's bungalow. A doctor in a white tunic sits on the porch, reading. On a small table beside him we a stethoscope and the equipment to measure blood pressure. He looks up at Mirabehn as she mounts the steps, and nods. Mirabehn reaches the doorway and is suddenly brought up. In the shadows, Ba sits by Gandhi's mat bed. She is holding him as he heaves in a spasm of dry retching, his face to the wall. When he is finished, he lies almost limp in her arms and she gently lowers him to the mat. She strokes his head. Mirabehn stiffens herself. She is not yet devotee and nurse. She removes her sandals and walks across the room. She strokes his sweating head again, touches his shoulder and gets up. For a moment the two women hold each other's gaze, then Ba smiles weakly, and leans her head into the taller Mirabehn's shoulder. Then Ba straightens, and leaves without looking back. Mirabehn bends and sits by Gandhi's side.",
    "149": "Ba and Gandhi are near to meeting now. Ba takes the last step, so that they are face to face. For a moment their eyes hold -- the many dreams, and hopes and pain -- the love of many years. Walker watches, his own face taut with emotion, now too entranced by the ceremony, by the depth of layered emotions in Gandhi and Ba's voices and eyes to take any notes. And Gandhi slowly lifts his hand. Walker and Collins both touched, the overtly cynical American obviously even more than the likeable Englishman. Gandhi turns to them. A tiny, beautiful city rising steeply out of the Arabian Sea with tall, thick-walled buildings, half-fortresses, half- homes, their white walls tinted amber and gold now by the early light of the sun. Gandhi, sitting on a promontory watching the sunrise in solemn meditation. He becomes aware of the sound of footsteps and he turns to see Walker approaching, a little knapsack over his shoulder. Gandhi smiles. Walker comes to his side, looking out over the bay and city, truly impressed. Walker looks down at him. Gandhi scowls up in the early light. They both watch the waves beat on the shore a moment, the changing hues of the sunrise on the whites of Porbandar. He looks out to sea, and we intercut his face with Walker's, the sea, and the town itself as the sun turns it white. Walker studies him as this profound man reaches, in his middle years, a profound insight. Gandhi staring out to sea, his mind locked in reflection, and suddenly his head lifts, his eyes become alert, he is caught by some excitement which he weighs for a moment, then he stands, his manner suddenly tingling with optimism. Walker stares at him, then at what Gandhi seems to be looking at. The waves lapping the shore below them. Walker turns back to Gandhi, puzzled. But there is no mistaking the sudden glow in Gandhi's face. Gandhi looks at him, a teasing smile. The grin broadens, and then he starts briskly down the promontory. Walker scrambles up after him. Gulls fly over them, squawking in the growing light. He turns from the sea to Walker, his eyes confident, elated, then he continues on down the promontory. Still baffled, Walker glances at the sea, at him, then hurries after. The waves running against the shore. He is looking in astonishment at his principal secretary. His ADC, a general, a brigadier, a senior police officer are with him. Like him they hold the same offices, but are a new team. Irwin looks at him, still trying to penetrate the significance of the act. The senior police officer helps.",
    "151": "He's taken out the ticket but there is a bit of bluster in his attitude and it is cut off by a cold rebuff from the European. He gestures to the back of the train. Gandhi is nonplussed and beginning to feel a little less sure of himself. The porter, wanting to avoid trouble, reaches for Gandhi's suitcases. He reaches into this waistcoat and produces a card which he presents to the conductor. Gandhi is still puzzled by his belligerence, but is beginning to react to it, this time with a touch of irony. The Porter stares -- amazed. He turns and walks out of the compartment. We are in a large Victorian parlor in a well-to-do home. Facing Gandhi are Khan, a tall, impressive Indian. Singh, slighter and older than Khan, but wiry and looking capable of physical as well as intellectual strength, and Khan's twenty-year-old son, Tyeb Mohammed. It is said with a dignity and strength that makes the statement all the more bewildering. Gandhi looks around helplessly. We see Mr. Baker, a wealthy white lawyer, whose home this is, poking at the fire, slightly amused at Gandhi's Na vet. Gandhi is holding a British legal document; he lifts it pointedly. Gandhi looks at Mr. Baker almost in disbelief. Mr. Baker smothers a smile. Gandhi looks at Khan incredulously. He smiles, but his eyes show that it is no joke. Gandhi glances from one to the other them -- absorbing the inconceivable. And then almost before our eyes his innocence of the world fuses with his anger at the injustice of it all. Its tone is chilling, and Gandhi's firmness is shaken a little. The sturdy Khan is studying him with a look of wry interest. Gandhi glances at Tyeb Mohammed and Baker, then stiffens, plainly frightened by the challenge, but just as plainly determined to take it. A wire basket has been placed on supports over the fire. Before them, a small crowd, mostly Indian (Hindus, Sikhs, Muslims), but with a few Whites drawn by curiosity. Gandhi whispers, trying to ignore the crowd. We see the English reporter waiting skeptically. Near him, trying to be inconspicuous on the edge of the small crowd, are five policemen (one sergeant and four constables). A horse-drawn paddy wagon is drawn up beside them. We see five or six women in saris standing together. We feature Gandhi's wife, Ba, standing at the front of the women. She possesses a surprising delicacy of feature, with large expressive eyes and a beautiful mouth -- but at this moment she is ill at ease and uncertain, forcing herself to do that which she would rather not. Gandhi wets his lips nervously. He glances with a little apprehension at the police, then takes his notes from his pocket and moves to the front of the fire.",
    "152": "A little band of drummers and flute players suddenly begins to play. The crowd starts to jump up to see, and the flower petals begin to float in the sky. Gandhi and the procession of marchers and ashramites stride down the dusty road toward them. A newsreel truck and crew ride along about two-thirds of the way back. A car of cameramen and reporters tails at the end. He looks at Walker, walking along a few paces behind him, at the side of the procession. He is wiping sweat from his face. Gandhi smiles and turns back. He shakes his head. And grinning at it, he passes by the policemen and into the cheers of the crowd. As the procession trails into the village, we see several villagers, knapsacks or bundles strung over their shoulders, run around the police and join the end of the procession. Gandhi in the center of the wildly cheering crowd, the camera pulling back and back. And the shot becomes black and white, and we hear the music of Movietone News. And with that we get the Movietone Music tag and as the film fades, the lights go up on. A couple of civil servants move about to raise the window shades while Lord Irwin stares at the blank screen set up in his office. The general, the brigadier, the senior police officer, Irwin's ADC and the principal secretary are all present. The two men who ran the projector are quietly dismantling it. Finally, Irwin turns to the senior police officer, who fidgets, but answers the implied questions. Irwin sighs. Irwin nods. For the first time he is truly angry. His face falls. Men, women and children are making little paper packets of salt from piles heaped along long tables. A group of policemen barge into the room, knocking tables and salt and paper in every direction with their lathis, seizing some of the volunteers for arrest. In the chaos an old man calmly picks up a piece of paper from the floor, a handful of salt, and folds another packet. Nehru is on the back of a big open truck that is stationary in the street. The truck is loaded with boxes that contain salt packets and Nehru and eight or nine others are selling them to people who flock about the truck. The sound of horses. Nehru lifts his head. Mounted Indian police are coming down either side of the street, a wave of foot police running forward down the center. Some of the people run, others deliberately stand fast. The mounted police converge on the truck. Nehru is grabbed, and hurled so that he half falls, half leaps to the street. One of the men with him is knocked along the ground by a policeman.",
    "155": "Bourke-White, who has been moving and crouching to shoot him and the light, sags back against the wall, relaxing at last. She has a smile as penetrating and warming as his. Gandhi grins and glances toward his dhoti, meaning he doesn't wear many clothes. Bourke-White bursts into an appreciative radiance, already she has assessed him, and been won. Gandhi walks along, Bourke-White loping along beside him, a little distance away, listening, but searching too for an angle, a moment that is right. She has Gandhi in the foreground, a soldier on the wall above and behind him. Gandhi shrugs but suffers it. We feature him, low, from her point of view, as he walks on, the soldier pacing on the wall in the background. She clicks. A spinning wheel works rapidly. Gandhi is at the wheel and he is smiling off at Bourke-White, who is trying ineptly to imitate him on another spinning wheel. The garden they are in has gone to seed a bit, but with latticed fretwork in the walls dappling sunlight on the grass and shrubs it is still beautiful. She's grinning at her own frustration and she keeps trying, but there's no doubt she means it. Gandhi's smile broadens. And they both laugh. A guard on the wall distantly looks at them wonderingly. He pivots around, moving beside her, and slowly demonstrates the process, taking her hands, guiding her. Bourke-White watches him as much as the wheel. And he smiles a little wisely at her. His tone is not altogether patient. She looks at him in surprise and he sighs tolerantly. Bourke-White accepts it at face value. She opens another line of inquiry. Ba pauses. Again Ba smiles. She shrugs, the implication is it was a long time ago. She looks at them soberly and then they all burst into laughter like girls. Military move quietly but urgently in and out around the main entrance. Two military ambulances are drawn up nearby. A British major comes down the steps quickly. He is almost at the bottom when a British army doctor starts to go up them. The major signals him to one side. They talk quietly and confidentially. The major looks defeated and depressed by the news. Ba lies on a mat, a pillow beneath her head, her eyes closed, her breathing short. Mirabehn sits next to her, rubbing a hand up and down her arm. Gandhi sits a little distance away, staring at the floor and into nothingness. Pyarelal sits inconspicuously behind him. Azad and Patel come to the doorway, Patel makes the pranam toward Ba and holds it as he obviously prays. Azad has bowed his head and he too is clearly making some prayer for her.",
    "157": "An Indian regimental band strikes up martial music. A detachment of Indian Royal Air Force comes to attention at the shouted command of their NCO. An elaborately dressed military aide opens the door and Lord Louis Mountbatten, resplendent in naval uniform, steps out onto the platform. He pauses and renders a salute. Nehru, Lady Mountbatten and dignitaries are present. English and Indians watch as Mountbatten approaches a group of microphones identified as NBC, CBS, BBC, etc. He grins in his youthful, beguiling manner and makes the pranam to the cheering crowd. It is cut off by the sound of a door being opened, close. Jinnah stands by one of the great pillars of the immense portico. It is a break in their Independence Conference, and as he lights a cigarette, a weary Gandhi approaches him with Azad. Jinnah's anger is clearly too deep to be left at the conference table. He slaps his lighter shut and addresses Gandhi in hushed but fiercely felt words. Nehru and Patel are approaching from the conference room, both of them looking worn and angry too. Jinnah raises his voice deliberately so Nehru will hear. Jinnah sneers at the idea, though he cools a little. Gandhi is staring at Jinnah trying to fathom the source of his anger and fear. He turns to see that Mountbatten has been standing in the open door to the conference room, as torn as Gandhi by the conflict, feeling it best controlled in formal discussion. Gandhi nods, and reluctantly the adversaries move back to the conference room. Gandhi is last through the door. Featuring Godse waving a black flag and shouting. We have pulled back and we see a whole gathering of Hindu youths near the entrance to the ashram. The youths -- and Kallenbach -- look back toward the ashram. Nehru has stepped out onto the porch and he glares at the youths. It is his presence that has silenced them. Gandhi is rising from the floor, where his spinning wheel sits. He stops, halfway up, listening, then, a weary sigh. Mirabehn is spinning across the room. She lifts her head as a signal to someone out of shot. Gandhi's two grand nieces, Manu and Abha, who help Mirabehn now that Ba is gone, rise quickly at Mirabehn's signal, Manu to help with his shawl, Abha to hold his sandals so that he can slip into them. It's cross -- he's worried about other things. Mirabehn just smiles at it. Gandhi looks down at Abha, and taps her sharply on the top of the head. She nods obediently, the flicker of a smile around her mouth, youthful, irrepressible. The beauty of it almost saddens Gandhi. He taps her again -- gently -- and goes out.",
    "159": "Patel reacts to that -- surprise, apprehension. Patel and Azad are there and Pyarelal of course, and with them now the giant figure of Abdul Ghaffar Khan, the first time we have seen him among Gandhi's intimate group. It is an empty and despairing echo of Gandhi's words. He has turned and seen Gandhi standing slowly. It has almost stopped him. He is moving toward the door. It stops them all. Gandhi turns, looks at him bleakly. There are fires, the sounds of spasmodic gunfire, of looting, screams, the roar of police vehicles and occasional sirens. The camera zooms in on a poor quarter of artisan dwellings in narrow streets. Outside one of the houses is a car, an army jeep, policemen, a few soldiers and a group of people. It seems a little island of calm in a sea of wild chaos. On the roof of the house, a figure moves into the light. He peers down at the dark, rioting streets. Azad, Tahib, a Muslim whose house this is, Mirabehn and Pyarelal are with him along Abdul Ghaffar Khan. A police commissioner moves to Gandhi's side, demanding his attention. A surging gang of youths, many carrying torches, and far outnumbering the little group of police and soldiers, are shouting up at the roof. We see three or four black flags and stains of blood on many of them. A few hold knives still wet with blood. It is a comment too grave for glibness, and Gandhi is obviously struck by the pain of it. He pauses for a moment, staring down at the youth. Nehru lowers his head again; it is like another burden on a man who already has too many. He grips his temples. Nehru thinks on it solemnly, then nods yes. The sounds of rioting and looting on nearby streets, but here a mass of people are gathered. Many youths with black flags. It runs up the side of the building and is lined with waiting people. Azad clears someone aside and ushers Nehru and Patel under the canopy awning. Nehru pauses as he lowers his head. Gandhi lies curled awkwardly on his side of the cot. He is writing, Pyarelal taking the pages as he finishes, both ignoring all the people, the sounds of gunfire and distant shouting, but he looks tired and tightens his jaw occasionally in pain. A doctor sits near the foot of the cot, Abdul Ghaffar Khan beyond him. Near the other edge of the canopied area, Mirabehn sits with Bourke-White. They are whispering quietly, but Mirabehn has stopped on seeing Nehru and she smiles a relieved greeting. She knows Gandhi's feeling for him. Bourke-White stares at him and Patel for a second and then her hand goes slowly, almost reflexively, for her camera.",
    "16": "Carolyn switches on the bedside light. She sinks into a chair, stunned. It's clear he knows where she's most vulnerable. He sees this, and likes it; it feels good to win for a change. He curls up under the covers contentedly. Close on Lester, smiling. We're flying high above the neighborhood. Below us we see the two Jims, jogging. We approach them steadily. We're now at street level, following the two Jims. Still running, the Jims turn back in perfect unison, as Lester runs into frame, wearing a baggy sweatshirt and a pair of faded old sweatpants. The Jims slow down until he catches up, then the three men run together in the early morning light. The Colonel stands, scowling, as Ricky comes out of the house, holding the urine sample in front of him. The Colonel is washing his Ford Explorer, squatting to scrub the bumper, when something catches his eye: Lester and the Jims jog down the street. Lester breaks off from the two Jims and jogs up to Ricky and the Colonel, out of breath. He grabs hold of his knees and bends over, panting. He laughs, and extends his hand to the Colonel. He salutes the Colonel good-naturedly, grinning. An awkward beat. He heads into the house. Lester waves at the Colonel, then follows him. The Colonel watches them go, his eyes dark. Ricky enters, followed by Lester. He gives the urine specimen to Lester, then locks the door. Lester picks up a CD case from a shelf and examines it. Ricky crosses to a bureau and opens a drawer. He takes clothing out and piles it on his bed. Ricky, having emptied the drawer, now removes a false bottom, revealing rows of marijuana, tightly packed in zip-loc bags. Lester smiles. This kid's cool. Carolyn, carrying a basket of fresh cut roses, passes by the garage window. Carolyn stops and sniffs the air, frowning. She peers through the window. Lester, in a t-shirt and gym shorts, lies on a new weight bench, doing bench presses with shiny new barbells. The garage is in the process of becoming Lester's sanctuary. Lester finishes his last rep, straining, then puts the weights in their rack and sits up. Lester looks up, squinting at: The door raises to reveal Carolyn, silhouetted against the bright sunlight outside, pointing a remote at us. Lester leans back on the bench and grabs the weights. And she's gone. Brad is seated behind his desk, reading a document. Lester sits across from him, smiling. Brad laughs. Brad stops laughing. Brad leans back in his chair, studying Lester. Exhilarated, Lester walks down a corridor, his belongings in a box on his shoulder. He's happier than he's been in years.",
    "165": "He turns and waves to the parlor window. The three boys are there -- all bigger -- and Ba holds a new addition; they all wave. And Gandhi turns back, and starts down the long, hilly street. He gestures Charlie on and starts walking. Charlie nods uncertainly. He looks back at the cab in confusion, then signals the driver to follow and hurries on to match strides with Gandhi's brisk pace. They have come to a turning, nearer to town, the area poorer, run-down. Ahead of them three youths (twenty, twenty-one) in working clothes, carrying lunch boxes, lean indolently against a building directly in their path. They react to the sight of Gandhi -- fun. Then stride the pavement menacingly. One of them tosses aside his cigarette. Gandhi restrains him and shakes his head. He starts to move forward. Charlie hesitates, then follows nervously, more nervous for Gandhi than himself. They are getting closer. The youths laughing, whispering. One youth has flicked his cigarette -- hard. It lands at Gandhi's feet. He pauses, looking at the youth. He starts forward again, he is almost on the youths -- clearly frightened, but. And he reaches forth to haul Gandhi from the pavement, but. A woman is leaning out of an upstairs window, looking down at the fracas disconcertedly. It is the first youth's mother and her presence reduces the pitch of his hostility considerably. A snickering response from the other youths -- but they are embarrassed by the questioning disapproval of Colin's mother's attitude. Gandhi steps back on the pavement, addressing the first youth. And he steps around him, Charlie trailing, as the first youth stares at them sullenly. As they stride on, Charlie glancing back. Gandhi laughs as they turn the corner. A busy street in the center of the town. Gandhi and Charlie come around the corner into it. He has paused before an office and a young girl (Sonja) has come from it to speak to him about something of urgency, but she hovers, not interrupting. And now he turns to Sonja. Sonja's tone is loaded with foreboding. Gandhi absorbs the news stiffly. A strong masculine hand scrawls a signature across a document. Beneath the signature we see the boldly printed identification: Jan Christian Smuts. A cameraman records the moment with a flash photo. General Smuts, whose presence is equal to his office, addresses someone out of shot as a male secretary removes the document. The reporter who stands opposite him is Walker, much, much younger, almost boyish compared to the way we saw him at the funeral. Smuts has risen. He knows how to concede with grace. The gaze is firm, strong, cynical. The sides are half up, but it is dusty and hot.",
    "174": "As Chili and Karen enter the restaurant, Chili checks out the bar, sees they aren't there, then looks up at the railing. He keeps his eyes up there as he says. Chili moves to the staircase, now sees the Bear in his Hawaiian shirt standing a few steps from the top. Chili slowly moves his gaze up through hibiscus until he's looking at the man's bearded face. Chili continues up the stairs to where Bo Catlett stands beside the table. Chili unbuttons his coat. Chili gets within three steps of the guy and stops, but doesn't look up, keeps his eyes fixed on the man's gut. Bo walks past Chili, goes down the stairs. Karen watches now as Bo Catlett puts a hand in his coat packet, steps right up to Chili. Karen looks at him. Even Karen is looking at him differently now as they slide into the booth with a now shocked, rapidly sobering Harry. Karen and Chili look at each other as Harry finishes his drink. Harry looks at the two of them, differently now. Chili looks at Karen, smiles, shakes his head. Harry looks at him. Harry's smile goes away. Chili smiles at her. Hooked. Martin is leaning forward. Martin leans forward. Bo Catlett exchanges a look with the Bear. Then, Bo Catlett signals the waiter. Karen, Martin, and Chili walk out to the driveway. Chili follows Martin over to the minivan, opens the door for him. Bo Catlett and Harry are laughing as Harry, very drunk now finishes another drink. Harry looks at Bo, can't believe what's happening to his life, thinks a moment, then. Harry shakes his head, looks around the restaurant. Bo and the Bear exchange look. Another glance at the Bear. And they all look. Harry looks at Bo, can't believe what's happening to his life, thinks a moment, then. Harry hangs up at the other end. Phone to his ear, Harry downs another drink, sits up. As Bones bursts out of the john and grabs the phone. This gets Bones' attention. Bones stares at the phone. He sits there a moment, also staring at the phone. Bones thinks about it a moment, then tosses the book aside. Chili stands there while Curtis opens Chili's wallet and looks at the driver's license while Dunbar in the plaid shirt pulls the Lakers T-shirt out of the athletic bag, feels around inside. Chili watches Curtis pick up the note with the Newark Flight number and arrival time written on it. Chili glances about, makes sure no one's around, then pulls the key for the 'right' locker out from a crack in the pavement, near the stairwell. Now there's a BIG GUY IN A PLAID WOOL SHIRT next to him, the same guy we saw when Bo Catlett was here. And Christ, ANOTHER GUY now, this one down the aisle, talking on his hand radio.",
    "176": "He steps on Harry's neck with his shoe, pinning him to the floor. Harry can't speak; his jaw is broken. He looks sad lying there pinned beneath Ray Bones' shoe, wondering how it all went so wrong. Harry, a crumpled heap, looks up and we see his bloody pummeled face as Ray Bones quickly crosses the room. Bones pulls a 9mm from his coat pocket and aims it down at Harry's face. Bones aims the gun at him. Ray Bones looks over as Ronnie Wingate strolls into the office. Harry actually looks glad to see him. Ronnie opens his jacket so that Ray Bones can see the .357 Ronnie's got tucked into his belt. Bones looks at the gun, looks up at Ronnie standing there, hands on his hips, holding his jacket open. Bones raises his own gun. Harry looks pleadingly at Ray Bones. Harry rolls over on to his side. Beer in hand, Chili sits in a chaise longue by the pool. Karen watches him a moment from the doorway. He looks over. She comes over, sits down. Chili looks at Karen a moment. Feeling him staring, she keeps her eyes on the sunset, and tries to change the subject. He looks at her, puts his drink down. And he leans over and kisses her. Karen and Chili lie in bed together. She looks at him. She leans over and kisses him. Chili and Karen both jerk upright. As Doris leads Karen and Chili towards the triage area. Karen and Chili exchange a look as they follow her into. Doris smiles as two UNIFORMED COPS walk past. Where Harry lies in bed in a pain-killer stupor. Both of his eyes are black. His face is swollen and purple. They all look over as a RESIDENT walks over trailed by several. Doris winks at one of the young med students as the resident then turns to her, Karen, Chili. They step back as the Resident pulls the curtain shut, blocking their view of Harry. Standing beside some giant mutant maggot or something. Bo Catlett looks at the Bear, then smiles at Farrah. Bear watches uncomfortably as Farrah sits down with Bo. Bo looks up at the Bear. And he winks at Farrah. Bo Catlett keeps his mouth close to her ear. He opens the door for her. Chili's minivan is parked out front. As the valet drives off with Chili's minivan, a CAB pulls up and Harry - his hands bandaged, his neck in a massive brace - gets out. Harry waves them off points to himself as he mumbles through his wired jaw. He then pushes past them and limps up the steps. All eyes are on Harry as they're led to a table.",
    "180": "Laurie comes back downstairs. She takes a key out of her purse and again steps to the window. She steps to the front door. She puts the key to the Doyle house in her pocket. Laurie locks the Doyle house and walks away out into the street. MOVING SHOT toward the Wallace house, dark and ominous. The wind whips her clothes and hair. She moves down the street, shivering in the chill wind. Bob's car sits there on the street. She picks up her speed, now up the sidewalk. The house looms closer and closer. CAMERA MOVES UP to the front of the Wallace house. Laurie walks up to the front porch. She KNOCKS on the door and RINGS the doorbell. She stands there a moment, listening, as if to hear some sound of life from the inside. She waits. Laurie thinks a moment, then looks to the street. She steps off the porch and walks around to the side of the house, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. She turns and walks through the breezeway between the house and garage around to the back door. Laurie pulls open the door and steps into the house. Laurie stands there a moment staring into the blackness. The kitchen is dark. Laurie searches for the wall light. She looks again into the darkness. Another SOUND from upstairs, a DRAGGING across the floor. The dragging sound STOPS ABRUPTLY. Laurie moves to the head of the staircase. Slowly Laurie starts up the staircase. SLOWLY TRACKING up the staircase as she slowly moves up the stairs. She reaches the top and stops. At the end of the hall is the bedroom door. From around the edges of the door is the faintest ORANGE. She moves for the door, CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS through the darkened bedroom of the Wallace house. She reaches the door. The door swings open. A Jack-O-Lantern casts and eerie glow around the room. There is SOMEONE lying on the bed but from this position Laurie can't see. She moves forward toward the bed. There on the bed is ANNIE! Her face is a chalky white and there is a huge red gash across her throat. She stares at the bed and then SCREAMS at the top of her lungs. Laurie jumps back to the door. Strung up to the light fixture on the ceiling, dangling there in the middle of the room, is Bob, eyes open and staring. Laurie shrinks back into a dark corner. SUDDENLY A DOOR NEXT TO HER SLOWLY OPENS. There is LYNDA standing there, propped up by a chair, staring at her with glazed, dead eyes. Laurie backs out of the bedroom. Her mouth is open in speechless horror.",
    "185": "Laurie glances back at the bushes behind them. The two girls stop in front of Annie's house, another small suburban home. Annie walks up to her door. For a moment Laurie looks around cautiously before searching down the sidewalk again. CAMERA TRACKING WITH HER. Again she turns around and glances back down the street. Suddenly, Laurie walks RIGHT INTO A MAN standing on the sidewalk in front of her. She SCREAMS and drops her books. It is LEE BRACKETT, Annie's father. He is a tall man in a county sheriff's uniform. Laurie bundles her books and hurries up the street. Brackett walks down the sidewalk to his house. Laurie walks up on the front porch of her house. She pauses a moment and glances down the street. Several CHILDREN in costumes are going door to door collecting their treats. She slams the receiver down. Almost immediately, the phone RINGS again. Laurie looks at it. She picks it up. CAMERA BEGINS on the trees that line the residential street, twisting and writhing in the dusk wind. She carries a totebag with schoolbooks and knitting needles stuck inside, and a large pumpkin. The sun is a pale glow behind the trees. SLOWLY CAMERA BOOMS DOWN to Laurie waiting outside her house by the street. Laurie turns her gaze down the street. More CHILDREN in costumes walk from house to house, some with MOTHERS and SISTERS, trick or treating. The wind blows their costumes, billowing them outward. She watches the trick or treater as a car swings around the corner and pull up in front of her. WIDE SHOT of an old graveyard on a windy hillside. CAMERA BOOMS DOWN as a car pull up on the small road in f.g. Sam Loomis gets out, along with TAYLOR, the graveyard owner. He glances at a small notepad. The two men begin walking along the graveyard, winding around headstones and flowers. Taylor stops cold. He points to a plot right in front of them. Taylor gives Loomis a quizzical look. Loomis stares. THE HEADSTONE IS MISSING, uprooted from the ground. Loomis shakes his head and looks across the graveyard. Taylor checks his notebook, then counts the rows and plots. Behind them, through the rear-view mirror, we see LOOMIS' STATION WAGON pull out of an alley and follow along. Annie points up ahead and quickly hides the joint. Annie's car drives through the main square of Haddonfield. Following behind is the station wagon. Two police cars are parked in the street in front of Nichols Hardware Store. Annie's car stops at the police cars. They quickly roll down the windows and begin wildly clearing out the marijuana smoke. Lee Brackett strolls out to the car and leans down to the window.",
    "187": "Then he steps closer to the object. Brackett bends down to it. Both men look down off screen at the animal. He stands back up and looks at Loomis. Brackett gets a disgusted expression and steps away. Brackett looks back at the dead animal. They glance at each other. Loomis walks over to the spot where the sister was sitting. Loomis turns and glances at the window. Brackett just looks at him a moment. Brackett turns and walks out of the bedroom. He slowly walks toward it. For a moment Loomis stares at the rain gutter in the broken window. CAMERA SLOWLY TRACKS IN toward the window. Loomis stops by the window. Brackett draws his gun and the two men step inside. Laurie sits with Tommy Doyle on the couch reading him a story. Tommy has his Halloween costume on and a big bag of candy on the floor. Tommy pulls out a stack of comic books from underneath the couch. Laurie glances through the stack of comic books. Laurie goes to answer it. She picks up the receiver in the den. LESTER, a large, ferocious-looking German shepherd, trots happily into the kitchen, spies Annie and walks over to her. Lester GROWLS at her menacingly. There is a dining room and living room with a big bay window that looks out into the street. It is a large home with a staircase that leads to the bedrooms upstairs. Tommy rushes out of the den. Tommy dashes up to the front window and looks out. We see the man as he passes under a streetlight on his way. Tommy runs to the window in the den and points. Laurie walks over with the phone and looks. The shape moves to see inside a window of the Wallaces house. Annie stands by the kitchen stove making popcorn. The shape stands close to CAMERA watching Annie make popcorn. Annie starts to pour the butter over the popcorn but instead pours it on herself. Annie hangs up. She quickly takes off her blouse and blue jeans. She stands in the kitchen with only her panties on. She pulls a box of cornstarch out of the closet and sprinkles it out on the stains of butter. The shape moves closer to the kitchen window and knocks over a potted plant. It CRASHES noisily against the side of the house. Annie is startled by the crash. A hanging plant swings in the wind. She looks outside the window. The shape leans up close to the kitchen window, looking inside. From the darkness of the back yard Lester springs forward into CAMERA, SNARLING and BARKING viciously. The shape darts away from the kitchen window, the dog SNAPPING right after him.",
    "19": "She puts two hands lightly on his waist to move him out of the way. He gulps at the contact since no one else ever touches him but covers his self-consciousness. She barks a mirthless though hearty laugh. If we could read Melvin which we can't, we'd see him unsettled by the date talk. The two waitresses signal their protests. Melvin walks back into the restaurant proper. He hangs near their table. His discomfort builds in this limbo. The Woman starts to protest. There is in Carol's attitude toward Melvin some ingredient of self-satisfaction -- that she is the only one in the place who can handle him. She starts to clear the table. Some crazy street-freak has slipped under her perfect guard and momentarily devastated her. Melvin senses that he's gone way too far. A beat and then Melvin nods, hardly breathing -- backing down. She walks away. Melvin watches her, biting his lower lip. She is underneath a YOUNGER, cuter MAN on the living room sofa. Each time startling herself with her own noise and trying to reign it in. The Young Man stops and looks at her. Pulling herself together she goes off down the hallway. She takes them off when she sees Carol, then hears the cough. Carol now goes into her son's room. The room is a monument to horrible, sleepless nights. Two drugstore de-humidifying filters, a nebulizer (breathing contraption) a waste basket. A night stand filled with medicine, a blood pressure kit. Along with some stacks of seven-year-old toys and a small TV wedged into the tiny space. Carol feels his head. Then he coughs -- trying to suppress it. She brings up a waste basket as he throws up. She comforts him. He apologizes. As she re-enters. He is taking a cigarette from a pack. He palms the cigarette. Resumes making out. His hand squeezes her breast. Then he stops and looks at his hand. She looks down and sees a bit of throw-up he picked up while feeling her and then notices him looking at her with extreme distaste. She barks a laugh to cover her embarrassment but speaks the truth. Seeing the Hustlers. He leads the way back toward the studio. Chatting away unaware that Vincent is disrobing as he follows him and eyeing the expensive apartment. And he turns and sees the naked model. Vincent moves back to retrieve his clothes. Vincent is striking blatantly sexual poses to the increasingly uneasy Simon. Vincent has instinctively put Simon on the defensive. Vincent's slack-jawed expression changes. He feels an intellectual tingle to be having this conversation. There's a joy in him at this moment -- a bit of purity. Carol and LESLIE, another waitress, are waiting for their order at the cappuccino bar.",
    "193": "Uncle Billy picks it up. Potter is seated behind his desk, his goon alongside him. Standing in front of the desk is a distinguished-looking man, obviously the president of the bank. He is mopping his brow with his handkerchief. George bangs the receiver down and turns to meet Uncle Billy's anxious look. He realizes George has hung up, and clicks the phone furiously. An ominous SOUND of angry voices comes from the other room. George and Uncle Billy exit from George's office. More people have crowded around the counter. Their muttering stops and they stand silent and grim. There is panic in their faces. As George speaks, sirens are heard passing in the street below. The crowd turn to the windows, then back to George. Mary and Ernie have come into the room during this scene. Mary stands watching silently. A man (Randall) comes in and makes his way up to Tom. He starts out. A few other people start for the door. CAMERA PANS WITH George as he vaults over the counter quickly, speaking to the people. The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still, listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them. During this scene Mary has come up behind the counter. Suddenly, as the people once more start moving toward the door, she holds up a roll of bills and calls out. George jumps over the counter and takes the money from Mary. Mary turns and slips out through the crowd, followed by Ernie. George hands the two hundred and forty-two dollars to Tom, and speaks to Ed, the next in line. Uncle Billy takes out his wallet and takes out all the cash he's got. George, Uncle Billy and Cousin Tilly are behind the counter, watching the minute hand of a clock on the wall as George counts off the seconds. Cousin Eustace is ready to close the door. Cousin Eustace slams and locks the door, and scurries around the counter to join the others. Uncle Billy is taking a drink out of his bottle. The four of them parade through the office; George puts the two dollars in the safe. George rushes into his office to look out the window. George hurries into scene. An old-fashioned, run-down house, unpainted and warped by the weather. It once had class but has not been lived in for years. This is the house that George and Mary will live in from now on. The rain is pouring down. A faint glow of light shines out from bottom windows. He stops to make sure it is the right number before going up the steps. Bert and man working in rain, sorting through travel posters.",
    "194": "A sharp whistle is heard. Ernie is leaning from the window. Bert and the man are putting up travel posters to cover up the broken windows. Ernie looks out through the curtain covering the broken glass of the front door. Ernie opens the door, revealing himself as a homemade butler. This has been accomplished by rolling up his pants and putting on an old coachman's hat. George enters. They rush into each other's arms and hold each other in ecstasy. They remain embraced. They finish their song, and Ernie kisses Bert on the forehead. Bert slams Ernie's hat on his head. The Martini family is moving. Martini and George, assisted by three of the Martini children, are carrying out the last of the furniture. The family consists of Martini, his wife and four kids of various ages, from two to ten. George and Mary are helping the Martinis move. About a dozen neighbors crowd around. Mary gets in the front seat of the car, with the baby in her arms. The family goat gets in the back seat with the three kids. In front of one of the miserable shacks that line the street are two vehicles. One of them is George Bailey's rickety car, and the other is an even more rickety truck piled high with household goods. The rickety caravan starts off down the street, to the cheers of the neighbors. The kids enter, with screams of delight. New lawns here and there, and young trees. It has the promise when built up of being a pleasant little middle class section. George and Mary are on the porch of the new house, with the Martinis lined up before them. Sam Wainwright is standing in front of his big black town car. Sam is the epitome of successful, up-and-coming businessman. His wife, in the car, is a very attractive, sophisticated-looking lady, dripping with furs and jewels. Sam is watching George across the street. Mrs. Martini crosses herself. The Martinis cross themselves, shaking hands all around. Potter seated in his wheelchair at his desk, with his goon beside him. His rent collector, Reineman, is talking, pointing to maps spread out on the desk. A buzzer is heard, and Potter snaps on the dictaphone on his desk. Reineman exits. He flips the switch on the dictaphone. George and Mary are talking to Sam Wainwright in front of the latter's car. His wife, Jane, is now out of the car. There is handshaking all around as Sam and Jane get into their car. The big black limousine glides away, leaving George standing with his arm around Mary, gazing broodingly after it. They slowly walk over to George's old car and look at it silently.",
    "197": "Potter is now behind his desk. He spreads the newspaper out in front of him, muttering as he does so. He sees the envelope, looks inside at the money. Then, to his goon, indicating the office door. Potter opens the door just a little, and peers through into the bank. He starts thumping his pockets, with increasing panic, and looks in the waste paper basket on the floor. Uncle Billy looks around for the money envelope. He looks puzzled, thinks hard, then a look of concern creeps into his eyes. He finally rushes through the door and out into the street. The goon wheels him back to his desk. He is deep in thought, with a crafty expression on his face. Uncle Billy running across the street in the direction of the Building and Loan. George coming from room where he has just left the bank examiner. He sees Violet Bick standing there. He hears a noise, and sees Uncle Billy entering the office. Uncle Billy comes hurrying in. Uncle Billy picks up the phone and speaks distractedly, without knowing what he is saying. He hangs up agitatedly, muttering to himself as he goes into his own office. Cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace look after him, dumbfounded. George has just finished writing something, and is slipping the paper into an envelope. She looks at him, then says a strange thing. She reaches up and kisses him on the cheek, leaving lipstick. George opens the door for her. As George and Violet come through the door, they are being watched by Cousin Tilly, Cousin Eustace and the bank examiner, who is still waiting to go to work on the books. Violet sees the lipstick on George's cheek, and dabs at it with her handkerchief. She exits. As George opens the door he sees Uncle Billy frantically looking for the missing envelope. The office is in a mess, drawers are opened, and papers scattered on the floor and on the desk. George stops short, suddenly aware of the tragic old eyes looking up at him. Uncle Billy gestures nervously for George to come in. He does so and closes the door. Cousin Tilly is at her switchboard, and Cousin Eustace standing beside her. Suddenly the door opens and George comes striding out. He goes directly to the safe and starts searching, but doesn't find the money. Then he goes to the cash drawer in the counter, and looks through it. Carter is still waiting in the doorway to his office. Cousin Eustace runs over to George. Uncle Billy and George are retracing the former's steps through the snow, looking everywhere for the missing money. They pause for a moment on the sidewalk.",
    "198": "They continue on down the street on their search. Potter is peering through the slats of the Venetian blind, watching them as they go. George and Uncle Billy continue their search. A shabby, old-fashioned, gas-lit room which has been turned almost inside out and upside down in an effort to locate the missing money. George grabs him by the lapels and shakes him. George jerks him to his feet and shakes him. Uncle Billy stands before him like a frisked criminal, all his pockets hanging out, empty. He throws Uncle Billy down into his chair, and still shouts at him. George's eyes and manner are almost maniacal. George turns and heads for the door, kicking viciously at a waste basket on the floor as he goes. Drawers of an old secretary have been pulled out and are on the floor. Uncle Billy starts sobbing hysterically. Uncle Billy is seated behind the desk, his head on his hands. Uncle Billy remains sobbing at the table, his head in his arms. There is a Christmas tree all decorated near the fireplace. Mary turns and sees George enter the hall, a slight powdering of snow on his head and shoulders. George sneezes violently. Mary stares at him, aware that something unusual has happened. George slumps into an armchair and lifts Tommy onto his lap. Mary is helping Pete decorate the Christmas tree. During this scene, George has been sitting in the chair, hugging Tommy to him, and crying quietly. Mary realizes that something is seriously wrong, and breaks off. Janie is thumping away at the piano. Mary leads him out toward the kitchen. They exit with Tommy hanging onto George's coat-tails, and pulling at him. As they go toward kitchen, CAMERA PANS WITH them. Tommy leaves, and Mary turns to the stove. They come through the door. George paces about the kitchen, worried. George goes toward doorway. Mary looks after him, puzzled and concerned, then comes over to Pete. The knob on the banister comes off in his hand, and for a moment he has an impulse to hurl it into the living room. Then, he replaces the knob, and goes on up the stairs. The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm over and over. Zuzu, aged six, is sitting up in her bed, the lamp burning beside her. She is holding her prize flower. George tiptoes in. Then, as he sees she's awake, he comes over, sitting on the edge of her bed. She starts to get out of bed. She shakes her head and presses the flower to her. A few petals fall off. She picks them up. She hands him the fallen petals and the flower.",
    "2": "We follow it as the wind carries it in a circle around us, sometimes whipping it about violently, or, without warning, sending it soaring skyward, then letting it float gracefully down to the ground. Jane and Ricky sit on the bed, watching his WIDE-SCREEN TV. Now Jane is watching him. After a moment, Jane takes his hand. His eyes scan hers, curious to see how she reacts to this. Then she leans in and kisses him softly on the lips. Lester sits at the table in sloppy clothes, eating his dinner voraciously and drinking beer from a bottle. Across from him, Carolyn picks at her food, watching him with contempt. Jane stares at both her parents, apprehensive. Jane does so, surprised and intimidated by the power in his voice. Lester gets up, crosses to the other side of the table to get a PLATE OF ASPARAGUS, then sits again as he serves himself. Lester hurls the plate of asparagus against the wall with such force it SHATTERS, frightening Carolyn and Jane. He goes back to eating his meal, as if nothing unusual has happened. Jane just stares at the plate in front of her. Jane is sitting on her bed. There is a KNOCK at the door. Jane rolls her eyes, crosses to the door and lets Carolyn in. She stares at Jane, then starts to cry. Carolyn suddenly SLAPS Jane, hard. Embarrassed, she quickly leaves. Jane looks in a mirror and rubs her cheek, then crosses to the window and looks out. We're across from Ricky's room, looking in. He stands at the window with his DIGICAM, videotaping us. We're behind Ricky as he videotapes Jane in her window. She waves. Ricky just keeps videotaping. A beat, then she starts to take off her shirt. She has now removed her shirt. She stands there in her bra, then reaches behind her back to unhook the bra. We ZOOM toward her as she takes off her bra clumsily. On the WIDE-SCREEN TV behind him, we see Jane standing in her window as she looks across at him. She stands there with her breasts exposed, trying to look defiant, but she's achingly vulnerable. Suddenly, the door is thrown open and the Colonel enters, incensed. Startled, Ricky turns around. As soon as his eyes meet his father's, he knows what's up. Ricky scrambles to dodge his father, but the Colonel is too fast; he punches Ricky in the face, knocking him to the floor. From her window, Jane watches, pulling the drapes in front of her. Ricky's lip is bleeding, but he maintains a steady gaze at his father during this violence. In the WINDOW across from us, the Colonel proceeds to give Ricky a serious beating, punching his face.",
    "20": "Leslie is telling the story of the traumatic audition which may have turned her life. As they pass Melvin she does not break stride, nor give him notice. Though she is aware of him -- resentfully so -- hard not to be since he is giving a moment to moment commentary on her every action. Melvin stops -- she passes behind him to deliver an uncharacteristic rabbit punch. Melvin just looks at her. She exits. The greenhouse studio is a busy sanctuary, as Simon puts the finishing touches on his painting of Vincent. Vincent quickly and expertly picks a CD to meet his immediate needs and puts it on -- dying a little at every second of silence during the transition. He gestures Vincent to take it down. A beat and then a strange figure crosses between the CAMERA and the scene -- gone before we can examine him further. Where it is not clear that a robbery is in progress -- Vincent's two friends from the street sweeping all objects into large sacks -- one of them, Doug, pauses to look past the terrace to the studio. And he uses the hat rack first as a spear, then as a club, as the brief savage attack begins. The three attackers leave. As he starts to go toward Simon and then scurries back in fear. A single BARK from VERDELL. A mass of OFFICIAL PEOPLE clutter the hall as a gurney is whisked down to the elevator. Melvin is standing against the wall near his door a cop, RAY, interviewing him. Frank standing upset, anxious, holding a dog bowl, a leash and VERDELL, who is more upset making pathetic little CRYING. As we FOCUS BRIEFLY ON Verdell. Frank is talking to the Sweet-Faced Woman. A short laugh makes us realize that Melvin has witnessed and enjoyed Frank's hostile mutterings. VERDELL starts WHIMPERING as a pissed Frank approaches his mugger. Frank pushes open the door to Melvin's apartment and places Verdell inside. We STAY with the dog during the O.S. VERDELL STOPS -- gives Melvin wide berth -- slinking along the far wall. Melvin finds Verdell's fear of him a bit calming. Melvin breaks two eggs over a large pile of prime chopped meat, sticks raw pieces of bacon into it and exits the room. Ignoring Verdell he sits at the piano and his one key repeatedly. His recent past making him suspect this feast is a trick. Verdell looks over with surprise and pleasure. Verdell shifts his body so he is eating from the bowl with his tail to Melvin. Frank on the phone. As Jackie enters. He turns toward her. Simon's face is something of a horror. The sight is a jolt.",
    "200": "George is seated at the bar he has had a great deal to drink, far more than he's accustomed to. During this, CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to George. George is mumbling. Nick, the bartender, is watching him solicitously. Martini comes over to his side. George shakes his head. Seated on the other side of George is a burly individual, drinking a glass of beer. Without any warning, the burly man throws a vicious punch at George, who goes down and out. Martini, Nick and several others rush to pick him up. Mr. Welch reaches in his pocket for money. Nick and Martini shove Welch out the door, then run back to help George to his feet. George's mouth is cut and bleeding. He starts for the door. Nick and Martini try to stop him, but he shrugs them off. George opens the door and exits to the street. George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow, suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house. George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door of the car, trying to shut it. The noise brings the owner of the house running out. The front lights are broken and the fender is ripped. George stands unsteadily near the car, shaken by the accident. George stands dully looking at the damage. The owner comes up, looking at his tree. He leans over to examine the damages. George staggers off down the street, paying no attention to the man. George is crossing the approach to the bridge when a truck swings around the corner and nearly hits him. The truck turns onto the bridge, and George takes a narrow catwalk at the railing. George has stopped by the railing at the center of the bridge. The snow is now falling hard. CAMERA SHOOTING DOWN from George's angle TO the water, dotted with floating ice, passing under the bridge. He stares down at the water, desperate, trying to make up his mind to act. He leans over looking at the water, fascinated, glances furtively around him, hunches himself as though about to jump. From above George a body hurtles past and lands in the water with a loud splash. George looks down, horrified. George quickly takes off his coat and dives over the railing into the water. George comes up, sees the man flailing about in the water, and CAMERA PANS WITH him as he swims toward the man. The toll house keeper, hearing the cries for help, comes running out on the bridge with a flashlight, which he shines on the two figures struggling in the water below. George reaches him, grabs hold of him, and starts swimming for shore.",
    "204": "We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. Gower's drugstore is now a pawnbroker's establishment, and so on. The motion picture theatre has become a burlesque house. George stops before what used to be the offices of the Building and Loan. A crowd of people are watching the police, who are raiding the place, and dragging out a number of screaming women, whom they throw into a patrol wagon. George talks to one of the cops. George sees the struggling figure of Violet Bick, arrayed as a tart, being dragged into the patrol wagon. The cop shoves George to one side. He looks around and sees Ernie's taxi cruising slowly by. Ernie stops the cab, and George enters it. Ernie turns to driving, but he's worried about his passenger. As he passes the burlesque house he sees Bert the cop standing beside his police car. Attracting his attention, he motions to Bert to follow him, indicating he has a nut in the back. Bert gets into his car and follows. The taxi pulls up to the curb and stops. The cab is parked. George gets out and looks at the house. George is stopped momentarily by the appearance of the house. Windows are broken, the porch sags, one section of the roof has fallen, doors and shutters hang askew on their hinges. Like a doomed man, George approaches the house. The police car has pulled up beside the cab, and Bert and Ernie stand watching George's actions. Ernie switches on the spotlight on his cab, and turns the beam toward the old house. The interior of the house is lit up here and there, ghostlike, by Ernie's spotlight. In a voice that sounds like a cry for help, George yells out. Clarence suddenly appears leaning against a wall. Bert is standing in the entrance, with his gun in his hand. He rushes toward Bert. Ernie is a few feet behind him, ready to run. Bert tries to lead George away by the arm, but George struggles with him, trying to explain. Bert raises his gun to hit George on the head. As he does so, Clarence darts in and fixes his teeth in Bert's wrist, forcing him to let George go. George dashes out of the house and down the street, as Bert grapples with Clarence, and they fall to the ground, wrestling. We see Bert kneeling, trying to put handcuffs on Clarence. Suddenly Clarence disappears from under Bert's hands. Bert gets up, amazed by his vanishing. He runs out of the scene. George runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the door.",
    "205": "The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs. Bailey, but she has changed amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In her eyes, once kindly and understanding, there is now cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows him. It is a cruel blow to George. She starts to close the door, but George stops her. She slams the door shut in George's face. George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk, until his face fills the screen. His features are distorted by the emotional chaos within him. They walk out of scene. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used to be. The two walk into the cemetery. George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at his heels. George jumps up. George grabs Clarence by the coat collar and shakes him. George lets Clarence go, and runs off. Clarence falls to the ground, where he rubs his neck. Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see George watching her from the sidewalk. Mary is very different no buoyancy in her walk, none of Mary's abandon and love of life. Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed, elbows close to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self- satisfied and efficient. George, as he watches her. She looks up, surprised, but, not recognizing him, continues on. George and Mary, on the sidewalk. Mary starts to run away from him, and he follows, desperately. He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on her. She struggles to free herself. Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door she comes to, the Blue Moon Bar. Mary comes running in, screaming. George comes in, practically insane. It is crowded. The place goes into an uproar. Some of the men grab and hold on to him. Many of the people are the same who were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary lets out a final scream, then faints into the arms of a couple of women at the bar. Just as George breaks through the door, Bert arrives in his police car. He gets out and heads for the door, to run into George as he comes out. He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the button, knocking him down, then continues running down the street yelling for Clarence. Bert gets up, takes out his gun and fires several shots after the fleeing figure. Bert gets into the police car, and, siren screaming, sets off in pursuit of George. The same part of the bridge where George was standing before Clarence jumped in.",
    "208": "A young man is looking over an assortment of luggage. As the camera moves up closer to him, he turns and we get our first glimpse of George as a young man. Suddenly, in action, as George stands with his arms outstretched in illustration, the picture freezes and becomes a still. Over this hold-frame shot we hear the voices from Heaven. The arrested closeup of George springs to life again. He brings a large suitcase up from under the counter. The place is practically the same except that it is now full of school kids having sodas, etc. A juke box and many little tables have been added. There are now three kids jerking sodas. He is behind the counter when George comes in. Gower's face lights up when he sees George. Gower is a different man now sober, shaven and good-humored. George suddenly sees the old cigar lighter on the counter. He closes his eyes and makes a wish. As he snaps the lighter the flame springs up. Pan shot as George crosses the street, Uncle Billy, cousin Tilly and Cousin Eustace are leaning out of the second floor window of the Building and Loan offices. Bert opens the door of the cab and puts George's suitcase inside. As George is about to enter the cab, he stops suddenly as he sees Violet (now obviously a little sex machine) come toward him. Her walk and figure would stop anybody. She reacts to this. She gives him a sultry look. As Violet goes by, George and Bert raise their heads above the top of the cab. Ernie sticks his head out from the driver's seat. On Violet's back as she goes. As she crosses the street, an elderly man turns to look at her and is almost hit by a car that pulls up with screeching brakes. Bert looks at his watch, then takes another look at Violet's retreating figure. Pop Bailey is seated at the dinner table. There are sounds of terrific banging and scuffling upstairs. Mrs. Bailey and Annie, the cook, look up toward the vibrating ceiling. Annie pounds on the ceiling with a broom. Pop is smiling and poking his plate. Mrs. Bailey is calling up the stairs. She goes up the stairs. A commotion is heard on the stairs, the boys imitating fanfare music. Down they come, holding their mother high between them on their hands. They bring her into the dining room and deposit her gracefully into Pop's lap. Pop kisses her. Mother gives Pop a quick hug, then turns with all the wrath she can muster on the two boys. Annie crosses the room, holding her broom. Harry reaches out for her. As he pushes her through the kitchen door, he slaps her fanny.",
    "21": "Jackie breaks into tears. They share a helpless half-laugh -- then Frank appears in the doorway. She starts to hand him a large mirror from her purse -- then thinks better of it. But he holds out his hand and she gives him the mirror. Simon holds the mirror poised for a moment of discovery, then he takes a breath -- like someone about to dive underwater. He starts to look. First a small, mumbled pep talk to himself. He quickly brings his hand up and looks at the mirror. An establishing shot featuring Verdell tied up in front. Carol looks totally beat as she sets down a cup of coffee. Melvin is craning periodically to keep an eye of his dog. She reaches for the plate of uneaten bacon -- he goes nuts. She is jolted by the insensitivity of his interruption, but he doesn't notice, turning, almost chatty. Melvin nods -- a bit frustrated about not being able to finish his dog story. He pockets the remaining bacon. As Melvin walks Verdell back home, we notice, perhaps a beat before Melvin, a remarkably event. Verdell is avoiding the cracks in the sidewalk. Melvin slows -- observes the dog mirroring his behavior. Again carefully placing his paws to avoid a crack in the sidewalk. Melvin laughs out loud -- puts on plastic gloves hurriedly so he can lift the dog to eye level. Melvin whaling away at his computer, reading to himself with great satisfaction as he goes. Verdell sits at his chair, fascinated by the speed of his master's fingers on the keyboard. He reads his writing aloud to the dog. As he looks over at the dog, Verdell trots over and, without realizing it, Melvin smiles at him to Frank's surprise. Verdell looks up at him. Melvin walks to the door. He turns the lock. Then checks that they are locked. Anguished, until now he breaks briefly, the dog looking on. Melvin opens the door -- looks at the scarred Simon in a wheelchair and shudders. A beat of silence as Melvin thinks whether to comply. Simon pats his leg -- trying unsuccessfully to get Verdell to approach him. Instead the dog goes to the door and scratches at it. Jackie starts to pick the dog up. Melvin bursts in on the psychiatrist and emits one word. Melvin shakes his head -- as if things weren't bad enough he must go through a careful exercise noting every new element before he's at all comfortable. More patients in the almost-crowded waiting room. Melvin passes through -- visibly drawn and upset. He stops. Eyes on them. They look stricken. He exits. Cheryl, a heavy-set waitress, reluctantly moves to his table -- unseen by Melvin as he takes out his utensils and arranges them.",
    "214": "The hobos stare. Everett gives an ingratiating smile as, behind him, the second convict starts to haul himself into the boxcar, the third convict still keeping pace outside. The convict running outside the boxcar door stumbles and disappears and the middle convict is yanked out immediately after. Everett, just finishing his speech, flips forward in turn, smashes his chin onto the floor and is sucked out the open doorway, his clawing fingernails leaving parallel grooves on the boxcar floorboards. The hobos impassively watch. The three men tumble, clanking, down the track embankment. Squush - they come to a rest in swampland at the bottom. They shake their heads clear, then rise to their feet in the muck and watch the train recede. Its fading clatter leaves the baying of hounds. Everett looks desperately about. Both men look interrogatively to Delmar. He looks from Pete to Everett, and nods agreeably. Everett makes a sudden hushing gesture and all listen. The men turn in unison to look up the track. A small, distant form is moving slowly up the track toward them. As it draws closer it resolves into a human-propelled flatcar. An ancient black man rhythmically pumps its long seesaw handle. The three convicts look out at the swampland which begins to show movement, the bowing grass trampled by men and dogs. The flatcar draws even and slows. The three men clamber aboard and the old man resumes pumping. The three convicts, faces upturned, listen raptly to the blind prophet. The cloudy eyes of the old man stare sightlessly down the track as the seesaw handle rises and falls through frame. The old man pumps - reek-a reek-a reek-a - as all contemplate his words. Bang! A rifle shot kicks up dust in front of the men. The front of the farm house shows only a harshly shaded front porch and a dark screen door. The screen door swings open and a child emerges on to the porch and steps down into the sunlight, holding a gun almost bigger than he is. The grimy-faced boy, about eight years old, wears tattered overalls. He pokes his rifle at the three men, who raise their hands. Wash Hogwallop, a sour-looking bald man, sits near a rusted bathtub in a yard littered with ancient car parts and farm implements overgrown with weeds. He is whittling artlessly at a stick. He glances up as the three convicts clank around the corner, then returns to his whittling. The four men and little boy sit around the kitchen table eating stew. A Sears Roebuck catalogue on the boy's chair brings him to table height. Wash glances at the little boy. The three men slurp their stew. He sniffs dubiously at his spoon.",
    "215": "The ranks of hooded men, chanting in a high hillbilly wail, intersect and shuffle like a marching band at halftime. At length they stop in perfect formation, still chanting, to face the Imperial Wizard, who stands in front of the burning cross dressed in a red satin robe and hood trimmed with gold. An aisle leads through the middle of the formation to the burning cross, before which a gibbet has been erected. The backmost row has stopped, facing away, only a few yards from the bushes that hide Delmar, Pete and Everett. As the chanting continues, two Klansmen lead a black man, whom they grasp by either arm, up the aisle toward the gibbet. It is indeed Tommy Johnson. Over in the bushes Everett, Delmar and Pete are straightening up and adjusting their appropriated robes and hoods, having disposed of the color guard. A huge roar - and now the ranks resume their chanting. The color guard hustles up the aisle to draw up behind the two men leading Tommy to the gibbet. Everett hisses. Tommy looks back over his shoulder. Everett is oblivious to the big man approaching from behind. Whoosh - arriving Big Dan whips the hood from Everett's head. Everett is exposed - in blackface. The chanting abruptly stops. The crowd is stunned. Big Dan whips off the other two hoods - Delmar and Pete, in blackface. Everett, Pete, Tommy and Delmar, bearing the Confederate flag, are retreating across the neutral ground separating the mob of Klansmen from the burning cross. The mob pursues in full cry. When the intruders reach the foot of the cross, Delmar turns. He javelins the flagpole up and out toward the pursuing crowd. Homer Stokes is mortified. The crowd gasps and watches, heads tilted back, in silence. The only sound is the fluttering flag. Homer Stokes' eyes rise, hesitate and start to fall as the flag reaches its zenith and starts to descend. We boom down with the hurtling flag toward a sea of upturned white hoods. Dead in the middle is bareheaded Dan Teague. His arms are tensed out at his sides like a waiting kick-off returner. He squints up with his one good eye, judging distance and trajectory. From somewhere we hear a loud BOINK, as of a wire popping. The flag flutters. The crowd is silent. Big Dan sets and. WHAP! He snaps his hands up and together. He has caught the flagpole. The flag has not touched the ground. The crowd cheers. Big Dan looks around, beaming acknowledgement of the cheers. From somewhere, another BOINK. As Big Dan's look reaches front again, his smile fades. His eye tracks up - up- CREEEEEEK! The fiery cross is twisting and starting to fall.",
    "218": "The rumble is building. The rumble erupts into a deafening roar. A wall of water is crashing through the hollow. It engulfs everything and everybody. The cabin itself is ripped away; the Soggy Bottom Boys are knocked off their feet and all is noise and confusion. A silent world. Everett tumbles in the current in natural slow motion. Suspended around him are scores of tins of Dapper Dan pomade. Other objects spin slowly by; framed sepia-tinted family portraits, tree limbs, a fishing pole, an outhouse door, a frying pan, a noose, an old banjo, the wild-eyed frantically paddling bloodhound, a tire with a rope tied around it. The churning torrent opens into a lowland to become a newly created river, fast-moving but no longer violent. After a beat of hold on the rippling waters, the surface is broken by the up-bob of a pine coffin. The coffin floats downstream for a beat and then Everett pops out of the water next to it, gasping for air, shaking his head clear of water, and moving his shoulders to finish freeing himself from the rope round his wrists. Pete and Delmar emerge nearby, gasping for air. The men hang onto the coffin, which bears them downstream. Dazed, they look around. The inundated valley shows only the occasional roof- or treetop poking out of the newly formed river. Everett waxes smug. His voice trails off as he notices something. A cottonhouse in the middle of the river is submerged to its eaves. A cow has taken refuge on its roof. It stands staring at Everett, who returns the stare. He shakes off the vision and clears his throat. Tommy has indeed just surfaced downstream, clinging to a half-submerged piece of furniture. The furniture beneath him begins to rotate in the current and, to keep his head above water, Tommy climbs in place like a hamster on a wheel. Everett and Penny walk arm in arm, the seven Wharvey gals behind. The girls sing 'Angel Band' as the grown-ups talk. He fumbles in his pocket. Everett shakes his head. Indignation quickens her pace. Everett keeps up, and the two are pulling forward out of frame. We are now on the Wharvey gals who follow in a ragged bunch, still singing. From somewhere distant, through the song, we can just hear a rhythmic clack of metal on metal. The second-to-last girl is the oldest; she holds a piece of string along which we travel, still listening to Penny and Everett, off. The string is given a tug and the little girl waddles out of frame. A train track is thus revealed in the distance. The blind seer pumps the car along the distant track, singing harmony under the Wharvey gals' receding voices.",
    "222": "He suddenly notices a herd of cattle grazing at the roadside and murmurs. He swings the tommy gun over with a whoop. One of the cows drops and the rest stampede toward the road. Energized, Nelson resumes bellowing. In bovine ignorance of the conventions of high-speed police pursuit, some of the cows have wandered up onto the road. The lead police car broadsides one. George Nelson, cackling wildly, fires into the air as his car recedes. The car is speeding into town, dodging and weaving through light traffic as George fires into the air - perhaps a means of clearing a path, perhaps an expression of high spirits. The car screeches to a halt and George hops out, and the three convicts emerge to follow him. Jowls shaking in a full run, George Nelson bursts through the door of the bank, followed by the three men. He fires into the ceiling and leaps up onto a table. He leaps down, fires into the air again, and sweeps a young woman standing in line into a full V-J dip, kissing her on the lips. Delmar nudges Everett. He whips open his suitcoat to reveal a half-dozen sticks of dynamite. He sends a burst into the ceiling, and heads for the door as customers murmur. George whirls. The customers stare mutely back. The customers shuffle their feet and glance uncomfortably about. Delmar lays a hand on George's shoulder and tries to steer him toward the door. George responds, barely audible and without brightening. Everett and Pete exchange significant looks. He digs into a pocket and tosses his car keys to a dumbfounded Delmar. George has turned woodenly and walks away, leaving the campfire's flickering circle of light. Delmar stares at Everett, who looks appraisingly at George's retreating back. Pete scrambles to pick up the loose money. A stakebed truck approaches along the road bordering the field. It is festooned with Stokes banners showing the candidate holding high a broom. Pickers perform in the bed of the truck, along with a dancer doing a two-step as he pushes a broom. A midget in overalls waves his arms, as if conducting the music. He switches off the microphone as the song, a duet of 'I'll Fly Away', scratchily issues from a monitor. He turns his attention back to a well-dressed man sitting nearby. The three men walk down a flat delta road, the sun shimmering off the rough pavement. The three men stand in the middle distance, waiting. In the foreground two little black boys are walking home, each carrying a block of ice. A spinning 78 on a green felt turntable. The crude black label identifies it as 'Man of Constant Sorrow' by the Soggy Bottom Boys.",
    "232": "A mess. Szpilman goes into the kitchen. From a bread tin he takes a small, flat greaseproof paper parcel and unwraps it. He continues to try to cut the bread, when there's a loud hammering on the front door. Szpilman stiffens. The hammering continues as Szpilman stumbles into the room, looks around, confused, not knowing what to do. From the other side of the door female voices, words indistinct, and then. He is galvanised into action, puts on a crumpled jacket, grabs his tattered coat and scarf, collects up a few of his things, stuffs them into a paper bag. The hammering stops. Szpilman cautiously approaches the door, listens, then opens it quietly and slips out. He slips out of the flat, goes to the stairs and stops dead. KITTY, young and fierce, stands on the stairs, blocking his way. Szpilman hesitates; she shouts more loudly. On various floors, doors open, tenants put their heads out to see what's going on. Summoning all his strength, Szpilman makes a dash for it, pushing past Kitty. Szpilman clatters down the stairs, reaches the ground-floor landing. Another woman tries to bar his way but he pushes past her and out of the house. Heavy snow. Szpilman stumbles into the street and runs. He darts down a side street. Szpilman lurches into the narrow street. He stops, almost collapses, but manages to keep hold of himself. He leans up against a wall. He removes a shoe and takes out the scrap of paper Gebczynski gave him. He reads it. Szpilman drags himself along, trudging through snow and slush. He comes to a villa. He goes to the front door, rings the bell and waits. The door opens and Dorota stands there. She is pregnant. They stand for a moment staring at each other. Szpilman follows Dorota into the living room. Szpilman sits down slowly. Awkward silence. He gazes at her. She looks away. He nods. Brief silence. Again, the awkward silence. The door opens and Michal Dzikiewicz enters. He sees Szpilman and stops. He shakes hands with Szpilman. Szpilman, dizzy, leans on the table for support. He and Dorota look at him. Szpilman asleep on the sofa. The sound of a cello. He opens his eyes. Listens. He swings his legs off the sofa, stands, and crosses to a door. Quietly, he opens it a little. Szpilman and his POV - another room. Dorota, partially turned away from him, plays Bach on the cello. Szpilman watches her and listens. A padlock being unlocked. Then, a key is inserted into the Yale lock, turned, and the door opens. Michal and Szpilman on the landing, enter the flat. A large room, sparsely furnished but with an upright piano and a bed.",
    "234": "Last, three young Poles, carrying long objects wrapped in newspaper. One of the men looks at his watch, glances around, then suddenly kneels and puts the package he's carrying to his shoulder. The sound of rapid firing, which makes the newspaper at the end of the packet glow to reveal the barrel of a machine gun. His two companions have also put their packages to their shoulders and begin shooting, all aiming their fire at the Schutzpolizei building. The sentry is hit and falls in front of his box. As if these young men have given a signal, now from all over the city comes the sound of gunfire. The pedestrians have scattered except for the old man, gasping for breath, hobbling on his walking stick, who eventually manages to disappear inside a building. Rifle and machine-gun fire from the Schutzpolizei building. The firing intense. The three young Poles manoeuvre to the corner opposite the Schutzpolizei and toss grenades into the building. A battle raging. The Germans firing from the hospital. Grenades thrown, machine-gun fire exchanged. Szpilman watching from his window, looks in the opposite direction and sees smoke rising. When he turns back to look towards the T-junction, he sees a Panzerfaust anti-tank rocket firer poking out from a window in the next-door building but on the floor below. The Panzerfaust fires. The shell hits the hospital. The city in flames. Sound of firing becoming sporadic, less intense. Isolated explosions. Szpilman, lying on the bed, staring at the ceiling. The interior of the Schutzpolizei building burnt to cinders. A horse-drawn cab rounds a corner and clatters down the street. The horse-drawn cab clatters out of his sight. He is about to draw back when he sees, directly beneath him, a man and woman walking with their hands in the air. Then, a German soldier, pointing his rifle at their backs, appears. Suddenly, the man and woman begin to run. The man turns and disappears. The woman also turns, but the German soldier drops to one knee and fires. The woman clutches her stomach, drops slowly to her knees and collapses on the street in an awkward kneeling position, and that's how she remains. Szpilman watches, aghast. Then, he hears voices outside his door, shouts, footsteps, panic. He runs to his front door and listens. More clatter of footsteps. Footsteps descending stairs, more shouts. Szpilman just stares at him. He studies Szpilman for a moment, then with a nod orders him to follow. Szpilman picks up the tin and follows. Szpilman follows the German Captain through a double door, hanging off its hinges, into a room with a broken table in the centre, what once was the dining room.",
    "235": "The German Captain's boots echo as they come into a spacious room through another set of doors. Faint moonlight filters through the large windows, revealing fallen masonry and broken glass, a couple of chairs, and a grand piano in the corner. The German Captain points at the piano. Szpilman hesitates, then limps to the piano, puts down the tin, and opens the lid. He turns and drags one of the chairs over and sits. The German Captain stands and watches. Szpilman glances surreptitiously at his hands, and then he plays Chopin. The German Captain listens, expressionless. The pale moonlight shows him to be a handsome, elegant man. Szpilman finishes playing. The German Captain stares at Szpilman. After a moment, Szpilman nods. Szpilman just stares at him. Szpilman hesitates, takes the tin and then shuffles past the German Captain towards the door. Szpilman and the German Captain enter. The German Captain takes out a flashlight, sees the ladder in place, leading up to the loft. Szpilman climbs the ladder, squeezes into the loft and looks down at the German Captain, who shines his light on him. Szpilman shows him the tin. He goes quickly. Szpilman opens the package, finds bread and marmalade. Then he finds a tin-opener. Snow. The Germans are evacuating the villa. Men carry out boxes, filing cabinets, desks, papers and load them into trucks. He opens the trapdoor to see the German Captain in the attic, carrying a package. Szpilman faces the German Captain. He hands Szpilman the package. Szpilman opens it to find inside several loaves of bread. Szpilman shivers with cold. The German Captain takes off his coat and gives it to him. Freezing weather. Empty streets. Then the sound of recorded music, as a car, with a loudspeaker and a Polish national flag, comes into view, the Polish national anthem blaring out from the speaker. Szpilman, wearing the German Captain's coat and under the eiderdown, hears the strange sound of the music, which he recognises. He's astonished, puzzled. He comes to a decision and starts to leave. Cautiously, in his German military overcoat, Szpilman trots down the staircase into the empty hall. He goes to the front door, opens it a crack and cautiously goes out. Szpilman looks around, hearing the car loudspeaker indistinctly. She runs, yelling, towards the field kitchen. So does the man. Szpilman stands and stares, then sees one of the soldiers cock his rifle and fire at him. Szpilman runs, the firing continuing. Szpilman bolts into the doorway of a ruined building. He peers out to see Polish soldiers beginning to surround the ruined building, firing shots, lobbing in a grenade or two. The Polish soldiers: Two of the officers stand near the entrance, hearing Szpilman's shouts.",
    "236": "Silence, each locked in their own thoughts. Father, wearing the Star of David armband, walks slowly along, carrying a string bag containing potatoes and carrots, his eyes fixed on the pavement as if his thoughts are a million miles away. He passes two GERMAN OFFICERS. They stop. Father stops, turns fearfully and approaches the Germans. One German Officer cracks him hard across the face, catching his ear. Father reels, collects himself as best he can and starts to shuffle on. Father steps off the pavement and walks in the gutter. Father walks on. Szpilman composing at the piano. He plays, makes adjustments with a pencil to the manuscript, plays again. Halina enters with a newspaper. She hands him the paper. He looks at it. His expression darkens. A map of the proposed Jewish area: two distinct districts, one large, one smaller. She looks over his shoulder and reads. As she does so, the door of Henryk's room opens and he stands leaning in the doorway, watching, as if amused. Szpilman gazes at the map, horrified. He laughs but they're disturbed by a sound from another room, the sound of crying. They look at each other puzzled, then Halina opens a door and looks in. Szpilman and Henryk join her. Father is asleep but Mother is sitting on the bed, holding a purse, crying. Halina sits beside her, puts an arm round her. Mother opens the purse to reveal a crumpled note. She weeps. Halina tries to comfort her. Szpilman and Henryk watch. Hands on the piano keyboard. Podgy, hairy hands with dirty nails. They play an octave, harsh, toneless, with straight fingers. The hands belong to Mr Lipa, a dealer, early fifties. He sits at the piano, now examining the lacquer. Regina stands in the bow, watching him. Henryk is at the table, also watching intently. Szpilman sits apart, aloof, his back to the piano and to Mr Lipa. Henryk suddenly makes a lunge for him, grabs hold of him, a rough struggle takes place and during it Mother and Father appear at their bedroom door to watch, appalled. Henryk subsides, glowering at him. A great column of Jews of all ages make their way towards the area that will become the ghetto. On foot, on bicycles, on horse-drawn platforms, some pushing prams loaded with belongings. A great moving mass of humanity. They're watched on either side of the street by Poles. On a horse-drawn platform, the Szpilmans with their belongings. All wear armbands. Szpilman, Halina and Henryk walk beside the platform with Mother, Father and Regina seated on it. Szpilman catches sight of someone among the onlookers, smiles and pushes through the crowd to Dorota, close to tears.",
    "241": "They struggle desperately. They start to walk. They walk on. A wooden bridge has been constructed, linking the small ghetto to the large ghetto. Few people about, mostly beggars and children. Szpilman and Henryk climb the stairs of the bridge, but as they reach the bridge itself Henryk stumbles, sinks to his knees. Szpilman gets hold of him, tries to help him stand. Szpilman supports Henryk, helps him towards the back of the cafe. Henryk, finishing a bowl of soup and a piece of bread, sits at a worktop with Szpilman and Benek. The kitchen is small and busy with cooks, waiters, washers-up. A dense crowd of people crossing the bridge in both directions. Szpilman, shabby and unshaven, hurries along and meets Jehuda Zyskind coming towards him, accompanied by the small man, Majorek. Szpilman stops. They're buffeted by the crowd. In the street below them, cars, trams, pedestrians and German guards. The name 'Samuel Szpilman' being written on a certificate. The clatter of sewing machines. SCHULTZ, a fat, sweaty German is filling out the form at his desk. Majorek beside him, standing, chatting to him and having a quiet laugh. In the doorway, Szpilman and Father. The small office is on an upper level with a window looking down on the factory floor where Jewish men and women are hard at work on sewing machines making the terrible clatter. Schultz stamps the certificate, hands it to Majorek, who gives it to Father. A great mass of agitated people crossing only one way: from the small ghetto to the large ghetto, carrying their belongings. A German film crew records the scene. They struggle across the bridge. A truck backing up. The tail-gate is opened to reveal a huge load of furniture, linen, clothing, mirrors, carpets, bedclothes. Three Jews inside the van start to unload the stuff, dumping it in the yard. Other Jews stand ready to start sorting the load, among them the Szpilman family. Each has their allotted task: Szpilman and Henryk sort out carpets, Father mirrors, Regina linen, Halina and Mother, clothing. The sounds of trains not far off. They carry the stuff into the warehouse. Szpilman and the others bring their piles of things into the warehouse, which is crammed with similar objects, an Aladdin's cave. The activity continuous. A large room with an improvised partition of blankets to separate the men from the women. Three-tiered bunks. On the men's side, Father is on the upper bunk, Henryk on the lower. Then a volley of shots, German voices shouting. Szpilman slips off his bunk, hurries to the door, opens it and comes face to face with a German NCO and soldiers. The NCO cracks Szpilman across the face, turns and goes.",
    "242": "Szpilman retreats into the room, his nose bleeding. The women are watching from behind the blankets, but Mother hurries towards Szpilman. She wipes his nose. Still quite dark. The Szpilmans and about twenty others lined up under lights shining on them from a couple of German vehicles. The NCO goes along the line, making a selection, using his pistol to prod people into moving. When he gets to the Szpilmans he selects Henryk and Halina. Then, he turns to those who are left. The NCO turns his pistol on the young woman and shoots her through the head. He marches off while she lies on the ground with blood spurting out of her. The partition has been pulled aside. People, including the Szpilmans, are dressing or dressed, packing up their belongings. Sounds of shots, screams, shouts, a piercing whistle. Hot, fine summer's day. Jews, among them Szpilman, Mother, Regina and father, clutching their meagre belongings, walk towards wooden gates and come to a halt. Jewish policemen approach and order the people about, pushing and shoving them into line. The gates are opened. They shuffle forward. Szpilman, Mother, Regina and Father, with others, enter through one of the gates, which closes on them. They pause for a moment to take in their new surroundings. People walk up and down. A young man, beside her, whispers to her, but she does not seem to take in what he's saying. Her cries continue at intervals. The sound of trucks. Everyone looks towards the gates. More Jews are being unloaded from trucks and are marched through the gates. Mothers, children, old people, begging, most of them holding papers. The sun high, blazing. Szpilman is wandering around, occasionally greeting people. The place is crowded now, packed. Old people lying down, exhausted, impossible to tell whether some of them are alive or dead. Women carrying dehydrated children drag themselves from group to group. One WOMAN approaches Szpilman. Szpilman shakes his head sadly. The woman with child wanders off to another group. EHRLICH, haranguing Father. Another man, Grun, joins in. A loud cry from Mother. Regina and Szpilman also call and wave. Henryk and Halina struggle through to them. Halina falls into Mother's arms and they hug. Mother comforts her. Father smiles sadly. Szpilman stands and stares at her. The place is now packed to suffocation. People calling out names, trying to find each other. The wailing of women and the cries of children. The Szpilmans sit in the same place, with Henryk sitting a little apart and now reading a small book. Grun leans across to her. Halina looks at him in disbelief. Szpilman takes the book and reads the title page. The Szpilmans seated on the kerb.",
    "243": "Their attention is caught by a BOY who has a box of sweets on a string round his neck. And he's setting the sweets, pocketing money. Father calls to the Sweet Boy and beckons him over. They search their pockets and handbags, hand over to Father what change they can find. He, in turn, hands the money to the Sweet Boy, who hands over one caramel and goes on his way. Then, carefully takes out his penknife and with great care divides the caramel into six pans. He hands a part to each of the family. They all exchange a look, an acknowledgement of each other, almost like a toast, and then they chew, slowly, deliberately. The whistle of a locomotive. Sound of trucks rattling over the rails. At once, a sound of great agitation from the Jews in the compound. The locomotive pulling cattle and goods trucks comes into sight, rolling slowly towards the boundary of the Umschlagplatz and coming to a halt. A cordon of Jewish policeman and SS guards. Among the great throng of people, the Szpilmans trudge towards the train. Szpilman and Halina walking. A Jewish policeman grabs Szpilman by his collar and pulls him back out of the police cordon. The rest of the family have reached the next truck to be filled. A scuffle as Szpilman tries to resist. Another Jewish policeman shoves him. Szpilman stumbles, falls to the ground, in front of him the closed ranks of the Jewish policemen's backs. He stands, runs at the cordon, seeing between their heads, shoulders, Mother, Regina, Henryk and Halina clambering into the trucks. Father is looking around, bewildered. Father sees him, takes a step towards him, but stops, smiling helplessly. He raises his hand and waves, then turns and goes towards the trucks. Again, Szpilman flings himself at the policemen's shoulders. Heller turns on him. Szpilman stands for a moment, confused, terrified. Then he turns and starts to run. Szpilman drops to walking pace, makes for the gates. Workers are pushing carts piled with the bloated corpses that lay against the wall. Szpilman falls in with them and they pass through the gates. The doors of the trucks are closed. The train begins to move. Szpilman catches his breath by a building. An SS man and Jewish policeman emerge. The Jewish policeman is servile, crawling to the German. He points to the train. They laugh as they walk away. Szpilman turns and stumbles down the empty street. He begins to weep, loud, agonised sobs, and staggers on. Szpilman, lost, empty, aimless, tries to catch his breath in the aftermath of his tears. He wanders forlornly down the street, passing empty buildings with their doors open, windows smashed.",
    "244": "The boy and girl laugh, their laughter putting a pause in their back and forth. A WAITRESS comes by with a pot of coffee. The Waitress pours the Young Woman's coffee. The Young Man lights up another cigarette. He calls to the Waitress. Then looks to his girl. The Waitress comes by, pouring him some more. The Young Woman scans the restaurant with this new information. She sees all the PATRONS eating, lost in conversations. The BUSBOYS going through the motions, collecting dishes. A smile breaks out on the Young Woman's face. And with that, Pumpkin and Honey Bunny grab their weapons, stand up and rob the restaurant. In the front seat are two young fellas one white, one black both wearing cheap black suits with thin black ties under long green dusters. Jules is behind the wheel. They CLOSE the trunk. Vincent and Jules, their long matching overcoats practically dragging on the ground, walk through the courtyard of what looks like a hacienda-style Hollywood apartment building. We TRACK alongside. They enter the apartment building. Vincent and Jules walk through the reception area and wait for the elevator. The elevator arrives, the men step inside. The elevator doors open, Jules and Vincent exit. STEADICAM in front of Jules and Vincent as they make a beeline down the hall. Jules stops Vincent. Jules looks at him a long moment he's been set up. He starts walking down the hall. Vincent, smiling, walks a little bit behind. They move a little away from the door, facing each other, still whispering. Making a gun out of his finger and placing it to his head. Jules just looks at him. THREE YOUNG GUYS, obviously in over their heads, sit at a table with hamburgers, french fries and soda pops laid out. One of them flips the LOUD BOLT on the door, opening it to REVEAL Jules and Vincent in the hallway. The two men stroll inside. The three young caught-off-guard Guys are: MARVIN, the black young man, who opened the door, will, as the scene progresses, back into the corner. BRETT, a white, preppy-looking sort with a blow-dry haircut. Vincent and Jules take in the place, with their hands in their pockets. Jules is the one who does the talking. Jules grabs the burger and takes a bite of it. Vincent moves to the bed, reaches underneath it, pulling out a black snap briefcase. Vincent looks up at Jules. Closing the case. As Brett talks, Jules takes out his gun and SHOOTS Roger BLOWING him out of his chair. Vince smiles to himself. He's not crying or whimpering, but he's so full of fear, it's as if his body is imploding. Brett can't say a word.",
    "246": "Jules, Vincent, and Jimmie Dimmick, a young man in his late 20s dressed in a bathrobe, are present. Marsellus Wallace sits at his dining table in a big comfy robe, eating his large breakfast, while talking on the phone. Jules paces around in Jimmie's bedroom on the phone. The camera looks through the bedroom doorway of a hotel suite into the main area. A crap game is being played on a fancy crap table by gamblers in tuxedos and lucky ladies in fancy evening gowns. The Wolf has a small notepad that he jots details in. He hangs up. A silver Porsche whips the corner leading to Jimmie's home, in hyper drive. Jimmie opens the door. Standing in the doorway is the tuxedo-clad man. He looks down to his notebook, then up at Jimmie. In the dining room, Jules and Vincent stand up. The three men hang back as The Wolf examines the car. He studies the car in silence. Jimmie exists. The Wolf continues his examination. Jimmie hands The Wolf a cup of coffee. He takes a sip, then, pacing as he thinks, lays out for the three men the plan of action. The Wolf and Jimmie turn, heading for the bedroom, leaving Vincent and Jules standing in the kitchen. The Wolf stops and turns around. The Wolf takes a step toward him. The Wolf is on the phone. Jimmie comes over with a handful of linen. Both Jules and Vincent are inside the car cleaning it up. Vincent is in the front seat washing windows, while Jules is in the backseat, picking up little pieces of skull and gobs of brain. Both are twice as bloody as they were before. The interior of the car has been cleaned and lined with bedspreads and quilts. The Wolf circles the car examining it. Jules and Vincent stand aside, their clothes are literally a bloody mess, but they do have a sense of pride in what a good job they've done. Jimmie holds a plastic Hefty trash bag, while The Wolf holds a garden hose with one of those guns nozzles attached. They follow instructions given by Wolf. He hands the now-naked men a bar of soap. He hits the trigger, water shoots out, smacking both men. The two men, trembling, scrub themselves. The Wolf stops the hose, tossing it on the ground. Jimmie tosses them each a towel, which they rub furiously across their bodies. Jules and Vincent are in their tee-shirts and swim trunks. They look a million miles away from the black-suited, bad-asses we first met. The Wolf and Jimmie laugh. The garbage bag is tossed in the car trunk on top of Marvin. The Wolf slams it closed.",
    "25": "Showing the enormous length of time which transpires until finally a seriously clean Melvin emerges from the bathroom through a cloud of steam. As they enters. They exit. As the car goes right across the street to a shopping mall. Melvin walks to the doorway and stops suddenly. CAMERA REVEALS that the floor is intricately patterned so that passage for Melvin is impossible. Melvin watches her approach. They arrives at the table. He holds out her chair for her. Melvin has no idea he has insulted her. Sandbagged in extreme, she gets up -- actually ready to leave. He waves her down. She thinks and then nods. The waiter is across the room. Amazing that something in Melvin rises to the occasion -- so that he uncharacteristically looks at her directly -- then. Carol never expected the kind of praise which would so slip under her guard. She stumbles a bit -- flattered, momentarily moved and his for the taking. Carol moves to the chair next to him. She sits very close -- he tenses. Their faces are close -- she looks at him. Her face moving toward him as he is wide-eyed and afraid. She closes her eyes for the kiss. But now his head moves back and he receives her kiss. Carol smiles encouragement to him and herself. But she has already turned away and exits the restaurant. He finishes dialing. He is extremely tense, a lump in his throat as he is trying not to let the anxiety immobilize him. He hangs up. His parents want no part of him and he needs help. As Carol enters with some energy. Simon struggles with his shirt -- she helps him, inadvertently venting some anger as she does so. Simon laughs -- as she crosses to the bathroom and begins to prepare a bath. We are ON Simon settling in for sleep, when instinct or sounds or the faint glow of hope turns him so that he faces the bathroom and we have. Carol sitting at tub's edge a towel around her the towel falls and a better than perfect breast exposed and now as Simon looks at the bathing beauty she adjusts her hair. He leaves the bed. He takes the blotter from the desk set and a pen from his jacket pocket which hangs on the chair and with vigor and faint pain moves to the other side of the bed where he turns on the light and stares at Carol. Simon's pen moves across the blotter -- Carol sees him earnestly engrossed, a beat of indecision and then shyly but deliberately she lowers the towel. Melvin sits alone, nursing a drink. He's been talking to the bartender.",
    "253": "Butch peers around a wall, taking in the vital information. Butch walks out of the alley and is ready for anything. He crosses the street and enters his apartment courtyard. Butch is in the courtyard of his North Hollywood apartment building. Once again, everything appears normal the laundry room, the pool, his apartment door nothing appears disturbed. Butch climbs the stairs leading to his apartment, number 12. He steps outside the door and listens inside. Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it. His apartment hasn't been touched. He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. Then he goes to the bedroom. His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment neat, clean and anonymous. Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster. Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter. This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it. He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut. Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see. The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking. He STOMPS on the gas pedal. The little Honda SLAMS into Marsellus, sending him, the donuts and the coffee HITTING the pavement at thirty miles an hour. Butch CUTS into cross traffic and is BROAD-SIDED by a gold Camaro Z-28, BREAKING all the windows in the Honda and sending it up on the sidewalk. Butch sits dazed and confused in the crumpled mess of what at one time was Fabienne's Honda. Blood flows from his nostrils. A PEDESTRIAN pokes his head inside. Marsellus Wallace lies sprawled out in the street. GAWKERS gather around the body. This jerk's yelling makes Marsellus come to.",
    "256": "The weaving knee-level tracking shot is following a six-year-old boy in shorts and a dirty T-shirt as he tramps around the trailer, brandishing a big stick. The track weaves off him and onto Hi, who is bending down to pull a couple of beers from the refrigerator. He raises his voice to make himself heard over the din of all the children boiling around the room. Hi considers this. Hi looks down. He starts laughing, then catches himself. He laughs; Hi doesn't react. Hi looks over at the TV, which the bam-shouting six-year-old is banging with his stick. The kid in the cowboy hat is reaching up to slap Hi on the ass. He takes a sip of beer. Hi is looking at another child who is just finishing off the T in FART in crayon on the wall. Glen chuckles, looking at his errant child. The sound of shattering glass. Glen looks around. Dot faces Hi and Ed across a picnic table covered with grilled hamburgers, rolls, green jello mold, cooler, etc. One of the younger children sits in the middle of the table, occasionally taking a fistful of jello and flinging it at Hi. The two women don't seem to notice. Hi sits stock-still with a stony face. Dot shrieks. Hi shrugs, then flinches as a piece of jello hits his shoulder. Dot is looking offscreen. We are tracking on Hi and Glen as they walk side by side. Glen is sopping wet, wearing only swimming suit and wing-tipped shoes. His body is ghostly pale except for a V-area at his neck and his arms below the short-sleeve line, which are a bright angry red. Glen bursts out laughing; Hi walks on in silence. He roars with laughter and slaps Hi heartily on the back. As he chuckles sympathetically. Glen is eyeing him shrewdly. He stops walking. Hi stops also, looking at Glen, Still puzzled. Glen lays a companionable hand on his shoulder. He looks around as if to make sure they are not being overheard. His tone is confidential. Glen nods energetically. Through tightly clenched teeth. THWAK - Hi's fist swings into frame to connect solidly with Glen's jaw. Glen's feet leave the ground. He flies back and lands in a heap. Glen in the foreground, groggily rubbing his jaw; Hi approaching menacingly. With Hi still advancing, Glen starts to run. With Hi pursuing in the background. Glen is looking back over his shoulder to shout at Hi as he runs. CRASH! - Glen runs smack into a tree and drops like a sack of cement. Hi is driving, his jaw rigidly set, his temple throbbing. Nathan Jr. sits in a safety seat between him and Ed.",
    "26": "He sits there, just another Joe on a bar stool with his heart breaking. He's excited -- smiling. Carol holding a pose for Simon. He is holding a ballpoint over the back of a hotel desk blotter. His style cramped by his cast. He struggles with the cast, and then decides to struggle no more. Summoning remarkable strength, he rips a piece from the cast, freeing his hand. He roars ironically, a lion's roar of liberation. He is back at his center. The door opens. Simon enters. Melvin is having a room service breakfast. Carol follows him out. Her arms are filled with the hotel soaps, shampoos, etc. Melvin reacts. Carol looks at Melvin. Simon finishes dialing the phone. He hangs up, totally satisfied with himself and rips over to Carol and Melvin. Carol, a load has been lifted. Melvin stalks out. The car parked near a phone booth. Carol walks up to Simon in the car. She hands him a baseball cap. Melvin hangs up the phone. She shakes her head and walks off. The door opens, revealing them. Simon notices some of his paintings. Simon looking at Melvin with some sympathy. Melvin's two digital clocks are two minutes apart. He sits in a chair still fully dressed. A beat then we hear Simon's whispered voice. As Carol unpacks, she gives gifts to her mother and Spencer. But clearly something gnaws at her psyche. As he speeds him out. She's just broken up with him but she's being nicer than ever. We enter the room carrying Verdell who strains to be allowed closer to Melvin. Simon releases him. He moves for the door. Stops suddenly, jolted. Walks reluctantly into the apartment house. As Melvin looks at Carol's doorbell with great uncertainty. The windows open, reading one of Melvin's books. Hesitates. Looks at his watch. Carol in a cotton wrap-around dress/bathrobe. She walks to her wide open window and looks over. The convertible at the curb. She hesitates. As Melvin gives up and starts out. Turning as the sudden blast of being BUZZED into Carol's life sounds. He bolts for the door and enters. She opens the door. He reaches her side. He half turns to leave. That Beverly, standing near her door down the hallway, has heard at least this last part. Carol has not ever heard anything like that before. Melvin, of course, cannot leave well enough alone. She disappears into her room. She looks at him then. Melvin glances at the cracked pattern of Carol's kitchen linoleum and stalls at the door. They walk quietly. Melvin still walking with his usual attention to where he steps. Melvin walking and though we can see an improvement it is still decidedly strange as he conspicuously avoids stepping on the lines.",
    "260": "Hi is shaking his head. Gale chuckles. Hi is still shaking his head. The camera has floated in to a close shot of Hi, staring glumly at GALE. Following it, very close, we see only its rear wheel and fender and twin exhaust pipes, one on either side. Flame is boiling in each exhaust pipe as the hog roars. From behind the Biker's head as he rides through the night. Creeping in. We are tracking in toward the one window that is illuminated, with a feeble yellow light. In voice-over, Hi is composing a letter. Creeping in on Hi's hunched back, as he sits over the kitchen table writing the letter. The yellow lamp sitting on the table is the only light on in the trailer. Creeping in on GALE and EVELLE, sprawled on the sofa and easy chair respectively, sawing boards. Still creeping in. Creeping in on the pimply-faced Cashier, sitting asleep behind the counter, a dirty magazine lying face-down, open on his chest. Creeping in on Nathan Jr. in the living room, asleep in his ottoman armchair, lit only by the snow from the TV set he is facing, a half-full glass of milk on the coffee table next to him. His robe is disheveled; his eyeglasses have slid down his nose. Creeping in on Ed and Nathan Jr., asleep together in the double bed. Ed's arm is draped protectively over the sleeping infant. We start to hear the rumble of the motorcycle mix up again. Night sky. The motorcycle tire enters frame as the bike comes to a halt. The Biker plants a jackbooted foot in the foreground. The engine rumbles. We are craning up over the Biker's back to reveal what he is looking at: We are on a bluff overlooking the trailer park. In the window of one trailer below, a yellow light glows. Still creeping in. Roaring at the cut. Through it we can see the Biker sitting on the ground, legs stretched out in front of him, back resting against his parked motorcycle, arms folded across his chest. Perfectly motionless, he stares at the campfire. We are floating in toward him. As we come closer, eventually drawing in to a close shot of his face, we gradually realize something peculiar about his eyes: He seems to have none. Although his eyes are unblinkingly open we do not see eyeballs, but only fire - either a reflection of the campfire or something roaring - burning-inside. A jackbooted foot grinds it out. Leading into the showroom. The Biker's mail-and-chained fist pushes the door open. Behind the jackboots as they stroll through a showroom of unpainted furniture and bathroom fixtures. Swinging as he walks, the Biker's hand produces a fresh cheroot from no apparent source-either sleight-of-hand or magic.",
    "269": "He indicates Ed with a nod of the head. He clears his throat and turns to the door. His tone is harder again. He snaps off the lights. He has disappeared into the hall. Looking straight down at Hi, asleep in the trailer bedroom. We start to crane down. A beautiful dusk landscape. We are floating in over the field, abutting the prison, that Gale and Evelle popped out of. In the middle background of the extreme long shot two men are walking across the field. Still floating forward but now much closer to the two walking men. We see that they are Gale and Evelle. Both are still dyed blue. They are approaching the hole in the ground. Evelle is starting to climb into the hole. Evelle has disappeared and Gale starts climbing in. The front door has a holly wreath on it. Five three-year-olds in their pajamas are opening presents around a tree as Nathan and Florence look on. We have been isolating in on one of the children peeling the wrappings off a package marked to Nathan Jr. Inside is a shiny red plastic football. Pulled over on the state highway in the middle of the desert, a police motorcycle parked behind it. Glen is leaning out the driver's window of the car talking to the state trooper who stands facing him. Glen is grinning and talking with his hands cupped in front of him, as when he told Hi about the Pollack who almost stepped in the pile of shit. The trooper, in crash helmet and dark sunglasses, is listening tight-lipped and stone-faced as Glen finishes his story and slaps his knee. The trooper is clicking open his ballpoint pen and reaching his citation book from his breast pocket. It sits on a tee in the middle of a football field. A cleated foot boots the football out of frame. Looking up, arms out at his sides, waiting to receive the kicked ball. He catches the ball and starts running. He is skillfully eluding and stiff-arming tacklers. He reaches the end zone and triumphantly spikes the football. He whips off his helmet and we track in on the face of the rosy-cheeked high-school bruiser. Still craning down, now very close to the sleeping Hi. The man and woman are sitting on a sofa in the foreground with their backs to the camera. They are in the living room of Hi and Ed's trailer, which is suffused with a warm golden light. As they face the trailer's front door, all we see of the couple is the backs of their heads. They both have white hair, the woman's pulled into a bun. The old man wears a cardigan, the woman a shawl.",
    "272": "Nathan is leafing through the lingerie ads in the newspaper. Muttering. Florence enters. As he gets into the driver's seat. He hands her the infant, then hands her the copy of Dr. Spock's Baby and Child Care. Hi nods as he pulls away from the curb. Ed suddenly bursts out crying. As the lights are thrown on. The room is hung with streamers. Ed is entering with Nathan Jr. He reaches for the child. He takes the baby in both hands and holds him out at arm's length, pointing him at the various places of interest. The baby looks goggle-eyed at each one. Impatient with the nonsense. He is propping Nathan Jr. up in the corner of the couch. Hi sits at the other corner and Ed sits in a facing chair. Hi beams at Nathan Jr. Ed smiles at Nathan Jr. Nathan Jr. looks from one to the other, deadpan. They seem to be waiting for him to contribute to the conversation. Suddenly Hi slaps his knee. Ed is getting up. As she picks up the baby. He is frantically reaching for a Polaroid camera. She sits down on the couch with Nathan Jr. as Hi starts screwing the camera into a tripod. Absently, as he sets up the camera. As he peers through the lens. As she complies. Hi sits on the couch, holding the camera's cable release. He puts his arm around Ed and smiles at the offscreen camera. Ed nestles her head against Hi's shoulder. Through his teeth as he continues to grin at the offscreen camera. The two men are trotting out to a Mercury that sits untended at a gas island, a gas hose on automatic stuck in its tank. As Gale starts up the car Evelle yanks the hose out and drops it to the ground. Gale is already starting to peel out as Evelle gets in. Hi sits asleep on the sofa at the far end of the room, in a pool of lamp light. By the time we tighten on his face the knocking has become quite loud. He looks up, alarmed. The front door of the trailer. Someone is pounding insistently. He sits up and tenses. He looks around. and squinting at Hi. She hisses. As Ed turns back to the bedroom. As Ed enters and shuts the door. She listens hard at the door: Hi's footsteps cross the living room, the click of the door opening, silence. a burst of raucous male laughter. Gale roars with laughter. Ed smiles politely, then squints at Hi. Gale is admiring the baby. Hi and Ed look at each other uncomfortably. Hi clears his throat. Gale is staring at the streamers and decorations. Reading aloud. Hi and Ed respond simultaneously.",
    "277": "At this moment, his attention is drawn to something across the way. While Jeff is continuing his phone conversation, we see the object of his look. He looks up, expectantly. There is almost a touch of eagerness in his expression. Two pretty girls have appeared on the distant roof. They are smiling and talking, although we cannot hear their dialogue. Each wears a terrycloth robe. With their backs to the CAMERA, they take off the robes, slipping them down over their shoulders slowly. Then they spread the robes in front of them, and lie down on the roof, and out of sight. They at least have all of Jeff's attention. Jeff seems a little disappointed. Jeff's eyes become set upon something else in the neighborhood he sees. Jeff's attention is now drawn to another feature of his backyard entertainment. Jeff asks, eagerly and alertly. She gracefully moves across the room to the rhythm of the music and dance, toward the ice box. THE CAMERA IS NOW FOCUSED on the window of the small building where we earlier saw the girl behind the oscillating fan. Loud ballet music is pouring from her open window. She begins the first graceful movement of a modern ballet interpretation. With her feet still moving, she throws open the door, and then rhythmically moving back to the center of the room, gnaws the chicken bone, occasionally waving it in the air as part of the choreography. She now twirls over toward a table at the other side of the room on which is an open package of bread slices, some butter nearby. The girl, now dressed in dark and revealing leotard, and ballet slippers, has just turned away from a portable record player. With swaying body, she puts down the chicken leg, and gracefully and rhythmically butters a slice of bread. She picks up both bread and chicken leg and continues her interpretive dance, alternately munching the bread and butter and chicken leg. Jeff's eyes drop from the ballet dancer's room to the one underneath. She looks up in the direction of the music and in a calm routine fashion adjusts the volume of her hearing aid. She is a faded, refined type. It is a simple, but broken, melody as if someone was just learning to play the piano, or carefully composing a song. At this moment we hear the sounds of a piano playing. Jefferies glances out across to the other apartments as he sees. It irritates Jeff as he looks in the direction of the new music. On the second floor, a man has entered the living room from a hallway door. We see a three-storied, flat-roofed apartment house. He carries a large aluminum sample case common to salesmen.",
    "278": "He quickly turns his wheelchair around to the window until he is in profile. The salesman, having just raised the shades in the living room, is now looking out the window. His eyes move closer toward Jeff's apartment. Jeff in his chair, facing the window, Stella beside him. Jeff nearly knocks the startled Stella off her feet with his arm. He propels his chair backward quickly, and Stella moves to the side with surprising agility. They are both in shadow. Jeff keeps his eyes trained on the window. The salesman completes his searching glance at the neighborhood. Then something directly below his window catches his attention. He looks sharply downward, his body visibly tensing. Jeff, with a restraining hand to Stella, begins to edge his chair cautiously forward so that he can see what the salesman is looking at. The CAMERA PANS DOWN and we now see that the old lady with the hearing aid is leaning over the fence admonishing the dog. The salesman leans forward and grips the window sill as he watches the dog. THE CAMERA MOVES FORWARD, and as it reaches the edge of the window, PANS DOWN and shows us what the salesman is looking at. The little dog that was lowered in the basket is sniffing at the salesman's personal flower bed. Jeff's eyes move up quickly to look at the salesman. We can faintly hear her voice saying something to the effect that he'll get into trouble. The old lady is wearing a faded house-robe. The dog turns to glance at her and apparently taking heed, moves away. Jeff is amused at the dog incident. Behind him, Stella moves to the center of the room, saying. She begins putting her equipment back into her black bag. Jeff's eyes lift to the salesman's apartment, and the amusement drains from his face. He is carefully wiping out the interior with dust cloth. The salesman has his aluminum case on the table near the center of the room. Jeff continues to watch the salesman, his face showing a great concentration of thought. Jeff watching intently. Stella picks up her bag, stares at Jeff's back a moment, then starts for the door. Jeff swings half-way around in his chair just as Stella reaches the top of the steps. She turns around. Jeff points to a coat-stand near the door. She puts down her bag, reaches for the binoculars, takes them out the case. She comes down the stairs, brings them to him. Stella sniffs, then goes to the door, as she says. As Stella goes out the door, the CAMERA MOVES IN until Jeff's head, and the binoculars, are filling the screen. He immediately swings to the window, and lifts them to his eyes.",
    "279": "The salesman has completed his cleaning of the case. He is in the act of placing it on the floor. Jeff quickly lowers the binoculars and edges back a few inches. He watches a moment, then cautiously lifts the binoculars again. He turns and again glances out of the window. The man is now moving out of the living room, and the binoculars PAN him though to the small kitchen which is seen through a side window. The man starts to busy himself in this kitchen with his back to us, but the image is very unsatisfactory. Jeff lowers the binoculars and there is an expression of exasperation on his face. He throws the binoculars down, and then looks about him. He backs his chair up quickly toward the main cabinet on his left. He leans down, opens a cupboard door and takes out a long-focus lens. Then from a shelf above he takes a small Exacta camera. He quickly takes off the existing lens and puts on the telephoto lens in its place. He wheels himself back to the window and raises the camera to his eye. Through the view-finder of the camera, we are now brought into close proximity with the salesman in his little kitchen. His back is still to us. He half-turns and takes a used newspaper. He spreads it open, along the drainboard. From the sink he takes out a large butcher's knife, and a long, narrow saw. They disappear from sight as he lays them on the newspaper and proceeds to wrap them up. Having completed his job, he emerges from the kitchen carrying the newspaper-wrapped parcel. For a moment he is lost behind the wall that separates the kitchen recess from the living room. Jeff lowers the camera for a moment, and watches tensely. Suddenly he puts it up to his eye again. Half of a man's body is now seen in the living room. He sits down on a couch, with a display of fatigue. He is not carrying anything. Then the salesman turns and moves to the center of the room. He yawns and stretches out of sight at full length on the couch. Jeff lowers the camera. He watches the living room for a moment. Then his eye travels briefly back to the kitchen; then return to the living room. The thermometer outside of Jeff's window, registering 83 degrees. The CAMERA PANS OFF to the left until it comes to rest on the song-writer's studio. He is dressed only in bathing trunks, and is vigorously cleaning his rug with a carpet sweeper. In the middle of his sweeping, he stops, hurries a step or two to the piano. He plays a couple of notes with one hand, while he stands.",
    "282": "He is looking out of the window tensely, as the camera moves in, until he is in big profile. From Jeff's viewpoint, all the windows are dark. The salesman's apartment is dark as well. Suddenly a match flares, and we see the salesman light a cigar. The flame of the match illuminates his face for a moment. The camera is now facing Jeff. As he talks, in a low voice, he keeps his eyes on the salesman's apartment. Lisa also talks in a low, quiet voice. We get an impression of Sixth Avenue behind Lisa at the phone. Jeff is still looking toward the salesman's apartment. He puts the receiver down, and resumes his vigil. When it dies out, we see just the glow of the cigar burning. All we can see is the glow of the salesman's cigar. Jeff is seated by the window in his wheelchair. He is talking on the telephone while his eyes are still on the neighborhood. The camera pulls back slightly as Stella emerges from the kitchen. She is carrying a tray with breakfast on it. Stella squeezes past the right side of Jeff, and places the food tray on a windowseat in front of him. There is a touch of urgency in his voice. She peers out cautiously toward Thorwald's apartment for a moment. Then she squeezes back, moving to the sideboard against which leans a small table on an adjustable stand. Stella returns with the table, and sets it up so that it is across Jeff's lap. She gets the tray of food pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment. Then she places the breakfast on the tray table in front of Jeff. He has moved back a little to avoid getting the phone cable tangled in the food and dishes. He hangs up. Eggs, bacon, toast and coffee. She moves behind his chair, pausing to look toward Thorwald's apartment again. He looks at the breakfast, reaches for a knife and fork. Jeff is just lifting a piece of bacon to his lips when Stella speaks. He begins eating, appreciatively. The hand carrying the bacon to Jeff's mouth hesitates for a moment. Again the bacon stops before it reaches Jeff's mouth. He puts it down on the plate again, as his eyes move slightly toward the left. The hand holding the bacon moves back to the plate. Jeff just stares ahead. Thorwald's apartment. Thorwald's apartment. The shades up. We are now aware that the salesman is now in his living room, lying out of sight on the sofa, because the smoke from a newly lighted cigar is starting to ascend toward the ceiling of his room. The rope-tied trunk still sits in the bedroom.",
    "283": "Jeff's eyes, over the coffee cup, are staring intently at the backyard. His eyes stray in an upward direction as he puts down the coffee cup. Stella turns and walks into the kitchen. Jeff's eyes moves down again. Abstractedly his hand strays toward the piece of bacon. Jeff pushes the food away, and picks up the coffee cup instead. Miss Torso, in ballet outfit, is hanging up a small wash on a clothes line. She is doing her inevitable leg practice at the same time. It consists mostly of lingerie. Jeff seems to be getting a bit listless, or bored, by constantly watching Thorwald's apartment. His eyes sort of stray around the neighborhood, and end up looking toward. Shade down, business as usual. The newlywed's apartment. Jeff smiles affectionately, and starts to turn his eyes away; but something startles him, and he looks quickly back. The shade suddenly going up in the newlywed's apartment. The young husband leans his hands on the windowsill, and looks out. He looks around with some satisfaction. He is wearing only his pajama bottoms, because of the heat, and we see that he is a well-muscled, attractive young man. Jeff's head snaps toward the center of his window. Stella has appeared behind his wheelchair. Two men wearing tan coveralls are standing outside Thorwald's door. He leads the two man across the living room to the bedroom. One of them carries a clipboard. His hair is disheveled and he is unshaved. He opens it, and after a short exchange of dialogue, he admits the two men, leaving the door open behind them. Stella and Jeff watching intently. He is feeling down alongside his wheelchair for his binoculars. A close view shows the two man carrying the trunk across the living room toward the corridor. Jeff lowers the binoculars quickly. Jeff turns quickly over his shoulder to watch her. Stella moves toward the door quickly. As Stella goes out the door, she calls back. She is already going up the steps. The salesman speaks some words to the operator. Jeff lowers the binoculars a little, and takes a normal eye sight on the alleyway. In momentarily blocks out the side of our freight truck. By the time the two trucks part, we can only see the back half of the freight truck before it pulls out of sight. Pulling across to the far side of the street we see the hood and cab of a freight truck. Jeff quickly puts the glasses up. The binoculars are held for a moment until we see a puffing and blowing Stella arrive at the opening of the alleyway. By the time the binoculars are up, another truck has crossed from the left.",
    "287": "Having completed his call, Thorwald returns to the bedroom carrying the handbag. He goes to a pile of coats lying on the bed. He lifts the top two coats slightly, and slides the handbag under them and out of sight. There is the SOUND of footsteps coming down the corridor to Jeff's apartment. He lowers the camera lens, and turns his attention to his door. The door opens, and Lisa stands silhouetted in the entrance, black-lighted by the corridor lights. Jeff's head is turned toward her, his back more toward the neighborhood. It's an attractive picture. Jeff abruptly turns back to the window, as Lisa dashes into the picture behind him, and looks out. The lights are out in Thorwald's bedroom, and Thorwald is in the act of pouring himself out a drink in the living room. He comes to the window, glass in hand, and looks down into the garden, nonchalantly. He stops, turns to her quickly. Jeff turns back to the window. Then he turns, puts his unfinished drink down on a table, and goes to the door. Thorwald is standing at the window with his drink in his hand. He puts the light out in the living room and goes out the door. He walks briskly down the corridor. He picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the street intersection, as Lisa moves back to him. The CAMERA PULLS BACK as Lisa starts around the apartment turning on the lights. As she light increases, we see that she is wearing another extravagantly beautiful dress. She seems quite animated, moving gracefully, her skirt and hair swinging with her movement. Jeff turns around to face the room. As he talks, she seems to be thinking something over to herself. He starts pacing, trying to distill her thoughts. We see that she has brought an oversized handbag with her, which lies prominently on the table. Jeff watches her. THE CAMERA CLOSES IN, Lisa stops, faces him. THE CAMERA eases back. She comes over to Jeff. Her eyes sparkle, and her body is tense with concentration. He pulls her into his lap. She puts her arms around him. She is very happy, and kisses Jeff's cheek. Then Jeff moves back a little to look her straight in the eye. There's a pause. She cuts him off with a kiss. Lisa smothers him with another kiss. When she pulls back. She lets up. She smothers him with still another kiss. Then moves back. She laughs, gets up. Goes to the large handbag on the table. She comes to Jeff, sits in his lap again, displaying the inside of the case. It is a Mark Cross ladies 'attache' case. She has opened it, and surprisingly enough, it is a compact outfit of pajamas, slippers, toothbrush, toothpaste, and all the general necessities for a comfortable overnight stay.",
    "293": "Jeff and Stella turn toward the window. Jeff grabs the long-focus lens, lifts it up. Thorwald has the new alligator bag belonging to his wife, in his hand. He moves slowly across the bedroom, out of sight behind the door. In a moment he reappears, moving back to his packing. He puts the handbag into one of the suitcases -- the one which he has almost completed filling. He goes on with his packing. Jeff puts down the long-focus lens, and turns around toward the room. The two women watch him expectantly. Stella lifts her left hand, and looks fondly at her ring finger. Jeff looks at them aghast. Lisa moves for the phone book on the stand near the kitchen. Lisa hands him the book. Jeff looks for Thorwald's number in the directory. The two women smile. Jeff picks up the phone and dials Chelsea 2-7099. The women watch him tensely. Lisa looks toward Thorwald's apartment; then Stella; then Jeff. Thorwald's apartment. He comes out of the bedroom toward the phone. He wears a light summer coat and tie, despite the heat. He holds the receiver away from his ear a little, and the buzzer is heard sounding on filter. In the bedroom, everything is packed with the exception of one open suitcase. He approaches the phone hesitantly, undecided whether or not to answer it. Quickly Thorwald does pick it up. There is a pause as Thorwald gropes for an answer. Thorwald looks at the receiver a moment, then he slowly hangs up. He hangs up before Thorwald can reply. He stands at the phone thinking. Then he makes up his mind and starts for the door. After he goes out he tests the door to make certain it is locked. Jeff turns his wheelchair halfway around as Lisa and Stella start quickly for the door, the camera panning them across the room. They pause at the sound of Jeff's voice. Jeff calls after them. The door slams off and we hear the footsteps of the women dying down the corridor as Jeff picks up the long-focus lens and takes a sight on the alleyway. Thorwald goes past the alley opening. Jeff puts down the lens and wheels quickly to the wall cabinet. He finds a box of flash bulbs and a reflector. He puts them in his lap and returns to the window, putting the chair sideways. He leans out a little and looks down. Lisa is in the courtyard directly below Jeff's window. She has reached the stairway leading up and to the right. She looks, waves at Jeff as Stella comes up to her carrying a shovel. The two women hurry up the stairs toward the iron ladder they will use to climb the wall between Jeff's yard and that of Thorwald's.",
    "294": "Lisa has climbed over the wall and is helping Stella down into Thorwald's yard. Jeff picks up the phone and quickly dials. The buzzer sounds on filter, then the phone is lifted. A woman's voice is heard and Jeff seems a little puzzled at the sound of it. He squints out the window. Jeff's conversation continues over the action of the two women. Apparently no sight of Thorwald. He looks quickly toward the intersection and then right back to Lisa. The shovel is lying on the ground beside Lisa. Stella has abandoned the shovel and left the flowers and dirt strewn over the walk. Jeff, tense and wide-eyed, watches Lisa climb the fire escape. While Lisa starts up the fire escape, we see Stella running toward the wall in the foreground to climb over it. Lisa climbs the fire escape to the second floor and the outside of Thorwald's apartment. She tries, unsuccessfully, to get through the window which opens into the kitchen from the fire escape. And then, with some difficulty, stretches and succeeds in getting in through the living room window, which is open. She goes directly to the bedroom and we see her bending over one of the suitcases. Jeff quickly picks up the long-focus lens and trains it on the salesman's apartment. Lisa turns from the suitcase with the alligator handbag in her hand. There is an expression of triumph on her face. She opens it and her expression changes to dismay. She looks toward Jeff's apartment and, to communicate her dismay, she turns the handbag upside down. Empty. He lowers the long-focus lens and he is sweating with anxiety. He mutters, almost to himself. His eyes turn quickly to the alleyway and back again to Lisa. She moves quickly to the dresser and begins opening the drawers to check them. Lisa has dropped the bag on the bed and is now looking around the bedroom, looking for some place to start searching for the jewelry. She finds nothing. As Jeff watches tensely, the door bursts open behind him and Stella hurries into the apartment. Jeff swings toward Stella. He reaches for the phone. As he picks up the receiver, Stella pushes his hand down again. Stella looks out the window and her face registers shock. Jeff turns quickly to the window again, forgetting the phone for the moment. Jeff and Stella turn for a quick glimpse of the song-writer's apartment. At this moment, from the song-writer's apartment which has been quiet for a while, comes a new burst of melody. A quick flash of the song-writer's apartment, and his musical group gathered around the piano. Miss Lonely Hearts lifts her head to listen, and slowly lowers the pills and glass of water into her lap, her whole purpose arrested by the beauty of what she hears.",
    "297": "She carries a copy of the Herald Tribune, and still wears her hearing aid. She settles into a folding, canvas deck chair. She gets up, walks to the fence, and looks over. He kneels down, inspects them, touches them affectionately and with some pride. His anger seems to have left him, replaced by the kind of peace that flowers bring many people. He notices her, but doesn't speak. She begins gesturing to him how to take care of his flowers. He listens for a moment, then looks directly at her. The strong movements of his mouth show us that he objects vigorously to the annoyance of her comments. She moves away from the fence, started and a little shocked. Jeff is seated in the foreground, in a waist shot. Behind him, the entrance door to his apartment opens. STELLA McGAFFERY comes in. Stella pauses on the landing to watch Jeff. She is a husky, unhandsome, dark-haired woman who is dressed like a district nurse, with dark coat, dark felt hat, with a white uniform showing underneath the coat. As she comes down the stairs of the landing, holding on the wrought iron railing with one hand. She carries a small black bag. She puts her bag down on a table. She takes off her hat coat, and hangs them on a chair. It is worn, and looks as if it belongs more to a fighter than a nurse. Satisfied, she walks to Jeff. A look at his face shows he doesn't think much of it. She swings the wheelchair around abruptly to face her. She takes the thermometer out of its case, shakes it down. Looks at it. She talks as she works. As she leaves him holding the thermometer THE CAMERA PULLS BACK as she crosses to a divan. She takes a sheet from underneath, and covers the divan with it. Talking, all the time. He takes out the thermometer. Jeff has no answer. She opens the bag, takes out some medical supplies: a thermometer, a stop watch, a bottle of rubbing oil, a can of powder, a towel. Defeated, he puts the thermometer back into his mouth. Stella goes on with her work. THE CAMERA PANS HER over to him. She takes out the thermometer, looks at it. She gets down the thermometer. She helps him stand on one foot. Then she helps him off with his pajama top. He hops one step, then she lowers him, face down, on the divan. She gets a bottle of rubbing oil. The CAMERA is very low at one end of the divan. Jeff's head, half-buried in the sheet, is large in the fore-ground. Beyond him Stella looms large and powerful-looking.",
    "305": "Joe is behind his desk. Joe looks at Vic. Vic swallows some Remy. Joe walks back around his desk and sits in his chair. Vic gets out of his seat and hugs Eddie. Eddie bobs his head up and down. Mr. Blonde calmly sits down. Nice Guy Eddie is driving to the rendezvous talking on his portable car phone. Mr. White, Mr. Pink and Mr. Blonde surround him and proceed to beat the shit out of him. The three men are stomping the cop into the ground. They are completely disheveled, hair a mess, shirttails out. The robbers have the cop tied to a chair and are still WAILING on him. Eddie steps inside the warehouse. Nice Guy Eddie walks in and everybody jumps. Nice Guy sees Mr. Orange. Mr. White crosses to Mr. Blonde. Eddie, Mr. White and Mr. Pink walk out of the warehouse talking amongst themselves. He then slowly turns his head towards the cop. Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop. He SLAPS the cop's face. He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth. The cop moves around wildly. Freddy finishes his playing possum piss, and walks past the sheriffs over to the sink. He looks down and watches Freddy wash his hands. Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop. He opens a razor. He turns on the radio. Mr. Blonde just sings along with Stealer's Wheel. Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's face, holding the razor, singing along with the song. Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out. A SLASH across the face. Then he reaches out and CUTS OFF the cop's ear. Mr. Blonde holds the ear up to the cop to see. We follow Mr. Blonde as he walks out of the warehouse. He opens the trunk, pulls out a large can of gasoline. He walks back inside the warehouse carrying the can of gas. Mr. Blonde POURS the gasoline all over the cop, who's BEGGING him not to do this. Mr. Blonde LIGHTS up a match. The gun-shot Mr. Orange looks at the kid's GASHED face and the hole in the side of his head where his ear used to be. Marvin starts to weep. We see Mr. Orange, now known as FREDDY NEWENDYKE, wearing a high school letterman jacket, enter the coffee shop, spot Holdaway, and head his way. We see through the window of the restaurant Freddy slide into the booth to Holdaway. Holdaway is listening to Freddy. Holdaway just looks at his pupil for a moment, then smiles. Freddy paces back and forth, in and out of frame, rehearsing the anecdote. He's reading it pretty good, but he's still reading it from the page, and every once in a while he stumbles over his words.",
    "306": "Freddy enters frame from the same direction he exited in the previous scene, finishing his sentence. When we move to a wider shot we see Freddy performing his monologue to Holdaway in a parking lot. Freddy paces back and forth as he performs his story. Freddy, Joe, Nice Guy Eddie and Mr. White all sit around a table in a red-lighted smokey bar. Freddy standing in front of six Los Angeles County Sheriffs and one German Shepherd. All of their eyes are on Freddy. Everyone is frozen. Freeze frame shot of Freddy standing in front of the sheriffs. A slow 360 around Freddy in the men's room. CAMERA does a 360 around the men. The dog is barking. One sheriff yells at the dog. The dog quiets down. A couple of the sheriffs look over at Freddy off screen, but as Sheriff #2 talks, turn their attention to him. Sheriff #2 continues with his story. SHOT of Sheriffs talking. THE CAMERA PANS away from the sheriffs to Freddy, up against the urinal, playing possum, pretending to piss. THE CAMERA PANS with him. A sheriff is sitting on a sink. Freddy finishes washing his hands. He goes to dry them, but there's only those hand drying machines. Freddy turns on the drying machine. CLOSEUP - His HANDS, rubbing each other getting blown dry. Mr. Orange looking from left to right. Machine turns off. Freddy turns and walks out of the room. Joe lights a cigar. Freddy answers it, we FOLLOW the receiver up to his face. CLOSEUP - Nice Guy Eddie speaking into the car phone. Nice Guy places the receiver back in its cradle. The CAMERA follows Freddy as he hops around the apartment getting everything he needs. He puts on his jacket. He exits FRAME. From inside an unmarked car across the street, the TWO COPS watching Freddy see him walk out of his building and up to Eddie's parked car. Freddy gets into the car and it pulls into traffic. Nice Guy Eddie is behind the wheel. Mr. Pink is in the passenger seat. The car laughs. The car reacts to how horrible that would be. The car reacts badly. The car laughs. CAMERA TRACKS ACROSS men's faces. Joe points a finger. Everybody laughs. CAMERA leaves the team and goes to the blackboard with the layout of the jewelry store on it. We see the outside of the jewelry store. A car whips around the corner, into the alley. The doors BURST open, Mr. White hop out. The alley is empty. Freddy opens the side door. He RUNS to the end of the alley just as a police car comes into SIGHT. Mr. White loads his two .45 automatics.",
    "307": "Fatigue overwhelms him, but he continues writing. In the driveway, 7-year old Evan plays with CRICKETT, a frisky cocker spaniel puppy. Andrea, wearing a mechanic's jumpsuit, works impatiently on the carburetor of a Toyota Celica. Evan pets the dog as he watches his mother work. Evan impatiently watches Andrea turn the bolt. The carburetor will not set properly. Evan blows Andrea a kiss goodbye and runs into the school. As Andrea pulls away, MRS. BOSWELL, 35, taps the car window. The classroom is filled with screaming, running children. Mrs. Boswell enters the classroom with Andrea and immediately calls out to TOMMY, a tough seven-year old kid who swings a whiffle bat at LENNY, now seven, a sniffling, chubby kid. Evan is surprised to see his mother enter with Mrs. Boswell, but continues playing with Kayleigh, now seven, a quiet, sweet-looking girl. Mrs. Boswell leads Andrea over to the teacher's desk. Mrs. Boswell opens the bottom drawer of her desk and pulls out a drawing. Andrea turns to stone when she sees it. The drawing shows a child holding a bloody knife while standing on a heap of dead bodies. Some of the corpses have been cut open and the insides are surprisingly anatomically correct. Andrea sees Evan playing with Lenny, harmless as a bunny, and struggles to control her concern. Andrea is visibly shaken now. Andrea leads Evan into Dr. Redfield's office. Evan busily writes in his new black-marble mead comp book. Andrea, meanwhile, speaks into the phone as she pours Lucky Charms into a cereal bowl for Evan. Andrea hangs up the phone and walks into the next room. Andrea grabs the pocket book off the coffee table and heads back into the kitchen. She drops her purse in shock when she sees: Evan, in doorway, expressionless and holding a large BUTCHER KNIFE by his side. Evan sees her but remains expressionless. He seems stunned to find himself holding the knife and drops it. Andrea, still shaken, drops Evan off at the house of GEORGE MILLER, 35, a handsome athletic man with an infectious smile. He approaches the car and opens the door for Evan. Andrea writes nervously on a piece of paper as Evan gets out. Evan nods and sticks his arms straight up in the air. The rec-room/basement. Miller's camera lens and finally to Kayleigh, whose ashen face trembles slightly. Panic spreads across Evan's face. Dr. Redfield leads Evan inside. Evan takes a seat at a long rectangular table. His eyes are fixated on the door on the other side of the room. Finally, a dark figure can be seen through the opaque glass. JASON, thirty and haggard looking, enters the room. Evan's eyes fixate on the leg-restraints and handcuffs that hinder Jason's movement.",
    "308": "Lenny is strapped onto a metal bed, his arms and legs in tight leather restraints. Evan sighs and gives up. Evan is ignored by several Theta Chi pledges as he plops himself by a tree and hunts through his journal to find the entry from when he was seven and visited Jason at Sunnyvale. Seven-year old Evan comes to during the time he first met his father, Jason. Jason launches himself across the table, shackles and all, and grabs hold of Evan's throat. Evan's hands instinctively reach for his throat, then he realizes his surroundings. Evan eats in the same diner where Kayleigh used to work. As he eats, his arm sits in front of his plate, protectively. Guarding his food. Evan slowly walks up the driveway, which is now a dilapidated mess. Garbage litters the front lawn and paint chips rot off the sides of the house. In a blur, Evan grabs Mr. Miller's shirt and violently shoves him through the house and into a wall. Mr. Miller goes slack, his eyes wide with horror. Evan walks past some junkies and enters. Evan steps over some passed out bodies that litter the hallway of an incredibly seedy motel. He knocks on a door. Kayleigh, now haggard, strung-out junkie, opens the door and immediately the contempt for Evan grows in her eyes. She looks around, waves him in. The room is dirty and sparse, excepting charred-bottom spoons, yellowed cotton balls and brown-spotted squares of tin foil. His eyes begin to water. Kayleigh eyes the wallet. She opens Evan's wallet and leaves a twenty on the table. She gets up and puts on her coat. She tosses his wallet over her shoulder at him and leaves. Evan enters his familiar looking dorm and hears the familiar sounds of Thumper having sex with another naked GOTHIC CO-ED. On Evan's bed. Evan's temper flares and he picks up a chair and SMASHES it against a wall above Thumper's head. Thumper and the co-ed quickly cover themselves in the blankets and leave. Mrs. Halpern, startled, stares at the young kid skeptically as she absently continues toward the mailbox. Lenny comes running across the street to Evan's aid, and Tommy shrugs and follows after him. Tommy takes a running dive at Mrs. Halpern, perhaps a bit too hard, and sends her and the baby to the pavement, hurt, but no major injuries. Seeing things are safe, Evan backs away from the mail. The blast is deafening! Evan's body is hurled backwards dramatically. Evan comes to back in his dorm, the same posters are on the wall, the sheets are the same. Evan yawns, bringing his hand to his mouth, but there's no hand. We see countless and brief image flashes of Evan growing up from the age of thirteen with NO ARMS, and requiring a.",
    "310": "Finally Jason sits. He smiles warmly and speaks in over-enunciated tones. Rather than seeing his father across a table, he's looking up at a ceiling. Blocking his view of the ceiling is Jason, whose face is now monstrous with rage, and whose cuffed hands are wrapped around Evan's throat, choking the life out of him. Jason wrestles the baton from under his chin, hits an orderly in the kneecap and comes for Evan with the baton! Orderly #2 acts quickly, beating Jason with his baton. Andrea hugs Evan, now in shock. All eyes turn to Evan as he takes his lit cigarette, breaks off the filter and jams the fuse into the unlit end. Lenny paces back and forth next to the three-story mailbox, desperately trying to appear nonchalant. He pretends to notice his shoe's untied and bends down to tie it. From the woods, the other kids watch anxiously. Finally, Lenny throws the bomb in the mailbox. Then sprints like hell to the woods. Kayleigh shakes Lenny's inhaler and hands it to him when he gets back. Evan pats Lenny on the back. The four watch the mailbox in intense anticipation. Evan smiles with the cigarette pressed tightly between his lips and places his hands over Kayleigh's ears. She smiles back at him and presses his hands against her head. Tommy catches this and seems disturbed, and quickly turns back to -- The mailbox. He instantly loses his footing and falls to the ground. Lenny, falling on top of him. Evan gets up and starts running, then realizes he's not being followed. Kayleigh and Tommy are helping Lenny up and carrying him. Evan realizes that Lenny's completely dazed. Evan doubles back, grabs Lenny's arm and he and Tommy drag Lenny through the woods as fast as they can. Lenny's mother, Mrs. Kagan, frantically loads Lenny into an ambulance. Andrea turns to Evan, now trembling on the front stoop. Evan looks helpless. Evan lies on a couch. Andrea suppresses the tiniest of proud smiles. Evan's eyes suddenly roll back in his head. Evan moans and begins shaking. Evan moans and shakes on the couch. Blood begins to trickle from Evan's nose as a guttural sound is uttered from deep within him. Andrea moves to stop the blood flowing from Evan's nose. Kayleigh, repulsed, suddenly darts from the aisle and runs out. Evan follows. Evan follows her to a small alcove. She begins to cry. He reaches to comfort her. But she winces. Kayleigh pulls back her shirt collar to show an even larger, darker bruise. She looks into his eyes. They lean into each other for a TENDER KISS. They jerk back to see Tommy, shocked and betrayed, staring at them from across a small crowd.",
    "311": "Tommy rushes through the small crowd at Evan. Suddenly a foot reaches out and trips Tommy. Tommy falls to the floor and the crowd cackles at him. Tommy slowly gets up, locks eyes with Evan. Evan looks guilty, weakly shaking his head, it's not what you're thinking. Tommy suddenly lunges at the teen punk who must be at least a foot taller than he is. Tommy lands a flurry of punches before the teen punk can even defend himself, frequently taking opportunities to eyeball Evan. Evan, Kayleigh and even the punk's friends look on helplessly when two security guards seize Tommy. As Tommy is being dragged away, he turns to Evan, a sick smile on his face. Evan and Kayleigh look back, speechless. Andrea drives through the winding roads. Andrea's eyes tormented. Reveal she's driving Evan and Kayleigh home. Evan's up front and Kayleigh sits behind them. Everyone silent. Andrea, in her nurse uniform, exits the house to her car. Evan discreetly watches her leave through the window. Kayleigh and Evan walk down toward the house. As a station wagon rolls up the street, Evan and Kayleigh duck in nearby bushes. The station wagon finally heads into the driveway. Lenny looks back at the model airplane. Evan, Lenny and Kayleigh pass a junk pile in the woods. As Evan and Kayleigh absorb this in silence, they see a column of smoke billowing in the horizon. Evan and Kayleigh run toward the smoke. Lenny nervously follows behind. They exit the woods to find Tommy has stuffed a dog into a gunny sack which he douses with lighter fluid next to a campfire. Evan and Kayleigh rush toward the trapped, helpless dog. Tommy is ready for them. He drops the lighter fluid, picks up a wooden plank and swings! Evan ducks back at the last minute and Tommy accidentally connects with Kayleigh's head, knocking her unconscious. Tommy, enraged, fakes a high swing, then goes for Evan's knee cap. Bash! Evan doubles over in pain and falls to the ground, clutching his knee. Tommy moves to the fire, Crockett squirming inside the bag and picks up the lighter fluid. Evan painfully looks up from the ground and his eyes dart from the sight of Kayleigh, unconscious, to Crockett, trapped in the tied gunny sack. Tommy squeezes the bottle hard, creating a flaming fuse from the campfire to the fluid soaked dog. As the flames near Crockett, Evan, seething with rage, stands up with clenched fists and charges Tommy at full speed. His body contorts spastically like a fish on land, since he is now lying face down on the ground. Evan regains himself and sits up painfully. His face is badly bruised and he clutches his battered ribs.",
    "315": "She giggles and snuggles into him. He's grateful for her affection, but still looks uneasy. The PHONE RINGS and he automatically answers it. Evan smiles to himself. And hugs her tighter. The pledges of Theta Chi busily gather around Evan, their clothes covered in dirt, food and what might be vomit. Evan, now dressed like his usual self, bangs a wooden spoon on a metal salad bowl that a poor THETA CHI PLEDGE wears as a hat. As she takes a step toward the table -- FLOWER PETALS shower down on her. She looks up to see TWO MORE PLEDGES standing on ladders, delicately tossing pedals. Kayleigh looks overwhelmed as she sits down. Her hand reaches out to his and grabs it fiercely. And they lean into each other for a kiss so enchanted it might as well be their first ever -- Hunter bolts up the stairs, two at a time. Evan and Kayleigh exchange worried looks. Evan runs down the front lawn to his car, the Honda parked at the bottom of the hill. Evan's car has been trashed and is surrounded by broken glass. The seats and tires have been slashed, the hood has been mysteriously yanked off and the steering wheel sits on the roof. The most unnerving thing, however, is a SPIKED LEATHER DOG COLLAR hangs off the rearview mirror. By now a crowd has gathered. She stares at the collar. Evan leads Kayleigh into his bedroom and shuts the door. He then locks the door, reaches into his desk and finds a tiny canister of Pepper Spray. Evan sits in silence for a moment, contemplating this. Kayleigh and Evan walk through the all-but-deserted campus. Tommy rushes Evan and bashes him with the tire thumper in the shoulder and ribs. Evan goes down. As Tommy prepares to bash his brains in, Evan whips out the Pepper Spray and nails Tommy in the face. Tommy reels back in pain, covering his eyes with this free hand. Evan struggles to his feet and circles around Tommy, keeping a distance as he douses Tommy with Pepper Spray. Tommy blindly stumbles around, madly swinging the tire thumper. She runs to a blue streetlight on the quad. Evan kicks Tommy hard in the ribs. Evan raises the tire thumper for a final attack and swings down OFF CAMERA. Evan sees what he's done and drops the weapon, horrified. Kayleigh sees what Evan's done to her brother. SIRENS come racing to the quad. Evan looks away from Tommy's limp body. A SECURITY VEHICLE pulls through the ominous metal gates of the large state prison. The vehicle stops and Evan, along with nine other convicts, exit in leg and hand restraints. Evan, now wearing his standard issue inmate uniform, enters the General Population area of the prison.",
    "317": "Evan nervously approaches. Karl and Rick wait expectantly as Evan nervously enters. Evan looks up to see Carlos staring at him with reverence. Carlos simply stares at him, awestruck, and hands over a box of cigarettes. They continue to stare. Rick stands. Evan nods reluctantly and peacefully drops to his knees. Karl and Rick lower their pants to their ankles. Evan looks miserable, about to do the deed when -- CARLOS bulldozes past the Aryans into the room, slamming Karl into the wall and jamming a shank into Karl's crotch! Rick instantly charges Carlos, but trips on the pants around his ankles. Evan, anticipating Rick's fall, stomps Rick's face before snatching his journals from Karl's shelf. Evan frantically flips through them, hunting for something, as the other WHITE SUPREMACISTS charge the cell. Carlos drops Karl's writhing body to the floor and presses his girth against the cell door. Evan locates an entry and concentrates on the words just as the other supremacists force the door open -- Evan focuses on the words. WORDS from the entry begin to SHIMMER. REVERBERANT SOUNDS OF BARKING break the sound barrier and the image of Aryans storming the cell behind him become a FRENETIC BLUR. Evan, thirteen again, comes to in the woods. Kayleigh and Lenny, walking by his side, do a double take. Evan roots through the trash until he finds something: a razor sharp piece of metal about two feet long. Evan offers it to Lenny. Evan places the metal shard in Lenny's hand. Lenny slowly follows Evan as he bolts away. Evan groans on the ground, writhing. Evan's words hit home and Tommy's anger slowly dissipates. Tommy looks at the sack and begins to untie it. Lenny comes screaming from nowhere like a bat out of hell! With all of the force he can muster, he jams the metal shard all the way through Tommy's throat! Tommy clutches his throat, gagging in blood. Evan surveys the scene in shock. Lenny drops to the floor, Indian style, wipes the dirt in his hands and freezes up completely. Kayleigh wakes up and SCREAMS when she sees blood spurt from Tommy's throat. Lenny, silhouetted by the sky, seems to vibrate violently as if operating a jack-hammer. His original college dorm -. Dr. Redfield and Andrea exchange looks. Dr. Redfield points to the CAT-scan slides, specifically, to the outer lining of Evan's brain. Dr. Redfield stares ahead. Andrea stares at him blankly. Dr. Redfield nods, awed by Evan's effortless interpretation. Evan looks around to make certain he's not being watched, then uses the security card to open the door. He looks in every room of the wing until he finds. Evan unlocks the door and is moved by what he sees.",

Rick looks at the German calmly, takes the card out of his hand, and tears it up. At this moment UGARTE, a small, thin man with a nervous air, tries to squeeze through the doorway blocked by the German. He gets through and passes Rick. The German storms off, tossing the pieces of his card into the air behind him. Rick meets Ugarte on his way back to his table. If he were an American, Ugarte would look like a tout. Fearing to offend Rick, Ugarte laughs. Ugarte pulls out a chair at Rick's table. Ugarte sits down. A waiter comes up to the table with a tray of drinks. He places one before Ugarte. He takes an envelope from his pocket and lays it on the table. Rick appears ready to take them from Ugarte. Rick takes them. Ugarte leaves the table just as the waiter comes up. He starts across the floor. Ugarte stops as Rick comes up to him. Ugarte hesitates for a moment. Rick looks at Ugarte steadily. Rick leaves the gambling room and goes into the main room. The cafe is in semi-darkness. During one of the periods when the spotlight is on the orchestra, Rick slips the letters of transit into the piano. FERRARI, owner of the Blue Parrot, a competing night spot, comes into the cafe, sits down, and watches Sam. Then he sees Rick and they smile at each other. At the end of the number Ferrari goes to the bar to speak to Rick. Rick and Ferrari walk over to the piano. Apparently satisfied, Ferrari walks away. Sacha, who looks at her with lovesick eyes, fills her tumbler. Back at the bar, YVONNE, an attractive young French woman, sits on a stool drinking brandy. Rick saunters over and leans on the bar, next to Yvonne. Yvonne has never taken her eyes off Rick. Rick looks the check over and tears it up. He pays no attention to her. Yvonne turns, looks at Sacha, and extends her glass to him. She looks at him bitterly, without saying a word. Yvonne wheels on Rick with drunken fury. Sacha stands at the curb on the street in front of Rick's and signals for a cab. He pulls her along toward the door. Rick and Yvonne approach the waiting cab. Rick stands and looks up at the revolving beacon light from the airport. Renault sits at a table on the cafe terrace, watching this evening's performance. Rick walks over to him.",
    "323": "Within seconds, tons of rock seal the doorway, throwing the Fellowship into Pitch Blackness. A faint light rises from Gandalf's staff, throwing a Creepy Glow across the old wizard's face. The Fellowship crosses a precarious bridge above deep mine workings. They continue up a steep stair, passing through a dwarf cemetery. The graves are despoiled, dwarf skeletons are strewn about and Goblin Graffiti is scrawled on monuments in dried Dwarf blood. The Atmosphere is very sinister. The path splits into three passages, each disappearing into dark tunnels. Gandalf pauses, frowning. The Fellowship are nervously waiting while Gandalf sits, staring intently at the 3 tunnel mouths in front of him. He appears to be in some kind of trance. A sudden glimpse of a creature darting in the darkness. Frodo is nervous, he approaches Gandalf. An emaciated, leering creature, blazes like a silent Flash of Lightning. Unnerved, Pippin backs away nervously, he stumbles against the well, sending a precariously balanced Armored skeleton tumbling in! Gandalf turns angrily on Pippin. They fall silent. Sam's eyes glance at Frodo's belt. Frodo looks down. A cold blue glow is emanating from Sting's Scabbard! Frodo draws the Sword and stares at its glowing blade. Aragorn and Boromir slam and wedge the doors. Boromir catches sight of something; he turns to Aragorn with shock in his eyes. Gimli snatches up two rusty dwarf axes and leaps onto the tomb. BOOM! The Door bursts open in a shower of wood fragments, and 20 Goblins charge into the tomb, followed by a huge cave troll! Gimli ducks a blow and immediately buries his Axes in 2 Goblin helmets. Aragorn and Boromir wade into the mass of Goblins with their swords. Legolas fires deadly arrows into Goblin throats, desperately trying to Shield the Hobbits! Gandalf is clutching his sword and joins in the battle! The cave troll is sweeping his club at Aragorn, who stumbles backwards. The huge club descends for the killing blow, suddenly, in a flash of steel, Boromir's long sword slices into the Scaly arm of the troll; it rears back, spewing green blood! Sam is backing up against a wall, a sword in one hand, a saucepan in the other. In desperation he swings wildly at a Goblin with a saucepan! It keels over, Sam looks surprised. He wallops another Goblin and it too, drops. The Cave Troll lunges forward, thrusting at Frodo's chest with his spear. Sam screams as Frodo is lifted off his feet by the spear tip and slammed against the wall. The hobbits go crazy. Sam slashes at the cave troll's knee, bringing him down, Merry and Pippin jump on him, Legolas fires an arrow, and the cave troll topples, dead. Aragorn rushes to Frodo's side as he slumps to the floor, Frodo appears to be dead.",
    "324": "Gandalf, Aragorn, and the Hobbits look horrified. Suddenly Frodo coughs and takes a huge breath. Frodo opens his shirt to reveal the Mithril Vest. Gandalf leads the fellowship into the huge Dwarrowdelf Chamber. They hurry towards a distant door as Goblins start scuttling down the Pillars behind them, like cockroaches. Frodo looks with horror at the overwhelming Goblin army that's rushing toward them. Suddenly, a deafening roar fills the air and a fiery light dances down the hallway. They back fearfully away from the approaching beast, melting into the darkness, the pillars casting eerie shadows. The Goblins freeze. A huge shadow, surrounded by flame, falls across the hall, the ground shakes, and an unearthly sound rumbles. Aragorn hesitates and Gandalf looks at him. Aragorn looks at Gandalf, concerned. Gandalf glowers at the young Hobbit. Aragorn leads the fellowship to the top of a dizzying stairway, Gandalf follows, leaning heavily on his staff. The Fellowship race down the stairway, Aragorn picks up Frodo, leaping across a gaping chasm. A narrow bridge spans a bottomless pit, Gandalf yells to the others, Aragorn makes to throw Gimli across the Chasm. They race towards the slender bridge of stone without kerb or rail at the far end of the hall. The Fellowship recklessly hurry over the dizzying bridge, but Gandalf, the last, pauses in the middle of the span, he faces the Balrog, staff in one hand, sword in the other. Frodo looks back in horror. The Balrog, a massive creature, rises from a chasm, a great 40-foot man-beast, with a mane of flames. In one hand is a blade like a stabbing tongue of fire; in the other, a whip of many thongs. Frodo watches as the Balrog puts one foot on the bridge and draws up to full height, wings spreading from wall-to-wall. Gandalf is a tiny figure, balanced precariously on the narrow bridge. Gandalf lets go his grip and falls away, following the Balrog into the bottomless abyss. Frodo cries out. Boromir scoops him up and carries him away. Frodo slowly turns, a look of numb shock on his devastated face. The Fellowship marches on. Aragorn scours ahead of the company, as they stumble on in the fading light, in the distance the shimmer of a large forest can be seen, Lothlorien. The fellowship run across a forest floor strewn with yellow flowers, above is a roof of golden leaves, held up by silver pillars, the trunks of huge, grey trees. Gimli looks nervously around. The Fellowship are suddenly surrounded by armed Elves. Deadly arrows aimed at their heads. Haldir, the Elvish captain, steps forward. He looks at Gimli with disdain. Haldir's eyes lock onto Frodo. Haldir leads the Fellowship onto a Hill Top. They look with wonderment at the vista spread before them. Several miles towards the South, a Large Hill rises out of the woods. Upon the hill rise many mighty Mallorn Trees, taller than any others, nestled high in the crown of the mallorns is a Beautiful City.",
    "327": "Frodo peers out from the seat, the world seems to shrink. In all directions, views of far off lands telescope towards him through the mist. They will fall! Frodo leaps off the seat, and tumbles down the stairs! The eye sweeps Amon Hen like a searchlight, seeking its ring! With a huge effort, Frodo wrenches the ring off his finger. Frodo lies gasping on the summit of Amon Hen, below the ancient ruins of the seeing seat. Frodo looks up as Aragorn towers over him. Frodo backs away from Aragorn. Aragorn is shocked by the movement. Frodo uncurls his fist, in his palm lies the ring! It glints, gold and beautiful in the afternoon sun. Aragorn's eyes are drawn to it. Aragorn freezes! He draws his sword. Frodo hesitates. Frodo backs away into the trees, as 200 URUK-HAI SWARM onto Amon Hen behind Aragorn! Aragorn attacks the leading URUK-HAI like a madman. He brings two down with his sword, leaping into the ruins as others close in on him. Sam looks around for Frodo. Aragorn battles the URUK-HAI, amongst the pillars and blocks of Amon Hen. LURTZ ordering his. Frodo scrambles down the hillside, away from the fight. Frodo is darting down the steep hillside as heavy feet thunder down behind him. ELVEN ARROWS smash into the URUK-HAI. Legolas races out of the woods, firing his bow. Gimli leaps into the battle, wielding his mighty axe. Frodo stumbles and falls, quickly he crawls behind a tree, above him the sound of Uruk-Hai crashing through the forest rings out. Frodo turns to see Merry and Pippin hidden in a hollow, a few feet away. Frodo looks at his friends. Slowly shakes his head, a great sadness in his eyes. Merry's eyes meet Frodo's. Understanding. Pippin stands and makes a move toward Frodo. Merry grabs at his arm. Aragorn desperately slashes his way towards Boromir, felling URUK-HAI in his path, while Legolas and Gimli fight a rear guard action. Many URUK-HAI fall to Boromir's sword as he tries to protect Merry and Pippin. Lurtz takes aim. A black arrow suddenly thuds into Boromir's chest. Amazingly, Boromir continues fighting, but another arrow, and another, brings him to his knees. Merry and Pippin are scooped off their feet by URUK-HAI. Boromir holds Aragorn's gaze. Aragorn places Boromir's sword in his hand. Boromir's fingers tighten around the hilt. Frodo looks to the far side of the river, the camera moves in on the ring. Tears fall down Frodo's face. With renewed determination, Frodo tucks the ring inside his vest pocket. The small figure of Frodo pushing the Elvish boat into the water. Sam bursts through the trees and runs toward the lake. Frodo is already paddling away. Sam starts to go under, spluttering and coughing. Frodo drops his paddle and scrambles backwards in the boat.",
    "332": "The strange tower of Orthanc, hewn from a solid pillar of black obsidian, rises up in the center of the Isengard Circle. Gandalf arrives at the foot of the Orthanc Stairs. He sweeps down the Orthanc stairs. Gandalf moves quickly towards him, grimy and weary from his long ride. Gandalf and Saruman walk slowly between the beautiful trees of Isengard, Saruman's clean, white robe contrasts with Gandalf's dusty grey robes. Saruman and Gandalf are seated in a small, cluttered room to the side of the cavernous central chamber. Gandalf and Saruman stride through Orthanc toward a stone plinth on which a sphere like shape is draped with a cloth. Saruman lifts the cloth to reveal the Palantir. Saruman sits upon his throne. Gandalf backs away and turns to run to the door, horrified as the doors suddenly slam shut. Gandalf slowly turns to Saruman, a look of dawning horror. At that moment, Gandalf is suddenly blasted across the room! He slams against the wall, pinned there by some unseen force. With sudden effort, Gandalf wrenches himself off the wall and swings his staff on Saruman, blasting him off his feet! Gandalf and Saruman battle, powerful blasts throwing them across the room. SARUMAN SCREAMS, EYES BLAZING! Gandalf's staff is suddenly wrenched from his grasp, it flies across the chamber into Saruman's hand! Gandalf is flung to the floor. Gandalf is breathing hard on the floor, his eyes look into the madness of Saruman. Commanding two staffs, Saruman sends Gandalf into a sickening spin. Gandalf tumbles towards the top of the chamber, as if falling in reverse. The roof of Orthanc rockets toward camera. Frodo and Sam walking along a country lane which borders Farmer Maggot's Fields. Sam is looking up, Frodo has disappeared around a corner in the lane. SUDDENLY! A figure comes crashing out of a hedgerow sending Frodo flying. Merry, Pippin, and Frodo picking themselves up. A variety of vegetables have scattered everywhere. A large pitchfork can be seen racing towards them along the Hedgerow, angry shouts from Farmer Maggot. Merry and Pippin hurriedly gather their booty and race away, with Frodo and Sam on their heels. Frodo, Sam, and Merry and Pippin tumble head over heels down a bank, onto a dark, wooded road. A winded Pippin, his face inches away from a large pile of Horse droppings. Pulls a LARGE CARROT, almost broken through in the middle, out from his back pocket. Pippin has spied something under the trees on the far side of the road. SMALL, brown mushrooms growing amongst the Loamy undergrowth. Sam, Merry, and Pippin race toward the mushrooms! Frodo is tense and watchful. Frodo picks himself up and looks around quickly. He realizes they are on a wooded road. Scattered leaves rise into the air Whirling down the road as if blown by an invisible wind.",

ARAGORN, THEODEN, EOMER, MERRY, LEGOLAS and GIMLI GALLOP into a VAST CAMP beneath the COVER OF TREES. TEEMING with MEN, HORSES and TENTS. THEODEN acknowledges GRIMBOLD, a MARSHALL OF ROHAN, as he passes by a GROUP of SOLDIERS. THEODEN smiles grimly as he rides on. ARAGORN joins THEODEN on a BLUFF overlooking the ENCAMPMENT.

LEGOLAS looking at a group of ROHAN SOLDIERS. They sit quiet and hunched. No-one speaking. LEGOLAS looking toward EOMER who is unsaddling his HORSE. GIMLI'S eyes travel to a ROW of ANCIENT STANDING STONES that mark the ENTRANCE to a ROAD leading away from the ENCAMPMENT and INTO the MOUNTAIN. ARAGORN stands before the road as though transfixed. Before him a HORSE whinnies and pulls at his ropes nervously. A GHOSTLY FIGURE seems to emerge from the gloom. ARAGORN starts in fright as. ARAGORN stares down at the LITTLE DWARF. ARAGORN casts another look back at the ANCIENT STANDING STONES before following GIMLI. All is quiet in the ENCAMPMENT. EOWYN kneels before MERRY, adjusting his HELMET. MERRY exhales -- excited and terrified in equal measure. In his EXCITEMENT, he draws his SWORD. EOWYN steps back, laughing. As EOWYN and MERRY leave the tent, EOMER and GAMLING are sitting nearby, finishing a meal. EOWYN ushers MERRY off. MERRY hurries off. EOMER watches the YOUNG HOBBIT leave. GAMLING stifles a laugh. EOWYN turns on both of them. At the PLATEAU edge, a GUARD looks down the STEEP PRECIPICE as a HORSE and RIDER move along the RIDGE. The HOODED FIGURE slowly RIDES up the NARROW ZIGZAG TRACK leading up to the PLATEAU. ARAGORN tosses in his SLEEP, disturbed by images and voices. As ARWEN lies dying, the EVENSTAR falls from her fingers. At that moment, ARAGORN wakes, his SWORD quickly in his HAND. A GUARD stands in the DOORWAY. ARAGORN hurries towards THEODEN'S TENT. THEODEN looks up as ARAGORN enters.",

A FLEET of BLACK SAILS moving along a SILVER RIBBON of WATER. ELROND hesitates a BEAT. A SUDDEN WIND rushes through the TENT, lifting HANGINGS, scattering MAPS, knocking over GOBLETS. As ARAGORN looks at ELROND, an IMAGE FLASHES in his MIND'S EYE. The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD. ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock. ARAGORN'S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND draws from beneath his robes. ELROND'S long white fingers draw the hilt of a SWORD from the scabbard to reveal a ELVEN SWORD glints in the firelight. ARAGORN takes the sword staring at it in wonder. ARAGORN draws the long blade from its sheath. ELROND stares hard at ARAGORN. A HEAVY SILENCE hangs in the room. ARAGORN re-sheathes the SWORD.

Aragorn stares into the blackness, his hair blowing wildly. The horses rear and buck in terror, turning and the three horses disappear. Aragorn turns resolutely towards the doorway. Aragorn walking into the blackness. Legolas quickly follows. Gimli left alone. He hesitates, struggling with his fear. Gimli plunges into the tunnel behind the others. Much activity. The entire camp is on the move. Fires are doused, tents pulled down, horses saddled. Theoden strides through the camp, Eomer at his. Preparing a little pony with a saddle and supplies. He is wearing an oversized helmet and Rohirrim clothing. He looks at once nervous and excited. King Theoden breaks away from a column and rides up to Merry. King Theoden wheels his horse away. Merry is bitterly disappointed. He stands, head down -- a tiny dejected figure -- as the mighty Rohirrim on their large horses ride by. Suddenly Merry is plucked off the ground! A soldier has snatched him by the collar. Merry twists around, looking up at the soldier. Beneath a helmet and mail hood is Eowyn, disguised as a man! Merry's face visible under the cape looking. The valley floor as thousands of horsemen ride out after their king. Great siege towers and catapults are rolling across the Pelennor fields. Thousands of flaming torches light the snarling, slathering Morgul orcs. Marching in ragged. Flowing torrents of orcs stream past cave trolls, beating the drums of war. Minas Tirith lies ahead -- only. Aragorn leads Legolas and Gimli into a wide cavern. He waves his torch through the darkness: illuminating a huge, cavern. A ghastly cracking noise, like stone being sundered, cuts through the silence. A ghostly figure step from the rock walls! Angles on: Aragorn, Legolas and Gimli look on in horror, as a mummified spectre looms before them: eyeless sockets. The king of the dead! Fog swirls around as the ghost snarls at Aragorn. Aragorn moves forward. The fog suddenly rolls back, forming a retreating wall of grey vapour. Slowly, rank upon rank of spectral warriors are revealed! Ghoulish faces. The fog reveals a dead army of many thousands. Assembled around the cavern! Angle on: Aragorn stares grimly at the king of the dead. Aragorn holds his gaze.

Rick appears in the crowd. He stops and puts his suitcase down and glances at his watch. He nervously checks his watch again. Rain pours over his head and shoulders, but he doesn't seem to notice.

Gandalf steering Shadowfax up the steep streets of Minas. The stares of frightened Gondorians as Gandalf and Pippin gallop through the winding streets. Aerial shot: Shadowfax, carrying Gandalf and Pippin up towards the 7th level. Minas Tirith is built in 7 levels -- each behind a circular defensive wall. Each level rises -- the city reaches a height of nearly 1000 feet on its topmost level. A towering bastion of natural rock -- shaped like a sharp ship's prow -- bisects the city from the 2nd level to the. Shadowfax arrives at a great citadel on the summit of the city -- 1000 feet above the Pelennor Fields. Gandalf and Pippin dismount, leaving the guards of the citadel to tend to Shadowfax. Gandalf hurries off. Pippin as he takes in his surroundings, his eye caught by a dead tree that stands in the middle of the court, four solemn citadel guards standing sentry around it. Gandalf leads Pippin across a flat court of white stones, surrounded by green lawns towards a great hall beneath. Pippin, suitably chastened, nods. A long solemn hall with rows of black marble pillars. Between the pillars stand a silent company of tall kings carved in cold stone. Gandalf strides down the hall, with Pippin following obediently behind. At the far end, upon a dais of many steps, sits a large, empty throne. On the wall behind is the image of a flowering white tree set in gems. At the foot of the dais, in a small stone chair, sits an old man, gazing at his lap: Denethor -- the Lord Steward of. Denethor slowly raises cold eyes. Denethor holds up Boromir's broken horn. Pippin remembering. Boromir, as Uruk-hai arrows thud into his body, he falls to his knees. Pippin starts forward unable to say nothing. Denethor pain flickers in his eyes. Pippin drops to his knee offering Denethor his sword. Denethor looks at Pippin blankly, overcome with grief. Denethor gaze turns slowly on Gandalf. Denethor smiles at Gandalf, as if amused by something. Gandalf looks shocked, Denethor's eyes narrow. Pippin, horrified. Gandalf looks at Denethor closely for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave, Pippin follows. Gandalf and Pippin stride from the tower hall. Denethor slumps back into his seat. Pippin is carefully laying out a small uniform of the royal guard on a bed.",

THEODEN strides onto the PARAPETS. THEODEN watches as below the SOLDIERS prepare. EOWYN hurriedly pulling on RIDING GLOVES, preparing to mount her HORSE. EOWYN turns and runs SMACK into ARAGORN. ARAGORN smiles. Reaching past her, he lifts a cover to reveal a SWORD, strapped to the side of the saddle of her. EOWYN deftly pulls the cover back down. She looks at ARAGORN.

    "365": "The Beast's journey takes it past a dangling fish hook, baited with worms. Past a tempting lure, sparkling in the sun. Past a swiping bear claw. The Beast isn't worried. WILL BLOOM, AGE 3, listens wide-eyed as his father EDWARD BLOOM, 40's and handsome, tells the story. In every gesture, Edward is bigger than life, describing each detail with absolute conviction. A few years later, and Will sits with the other INDIAN GUIDES as Edward continues telling the story to the tribe. Edward points to his wedding band, glinting in the firelight. While the other boys are rapt with attention, Will looks bored. Edward is chatting up Will's pretty DATE to the homecoming dance. She is enjoying the story, but also the force of Edward's charisma. He's hypnotizing. WILL, now 17 with braces, is fuming and ready to leave. His mother SANDRA -- from whom he gets his good looks and practicality -- stands with him at the door. She looks gorgeous. She couldn't be any happier if this were her own wedding. Will can't take any more. Josephine tries to hold him back, but he gets up and leaves. As he leaves, Will mutters in perfect unison with his father. Will reaches the door, where his mother intercepts him. He focuses his words on Sandra. A LAUGH from the crowd. Edward motions for Sandra to get up here with him. As she crosses, we can see that thirty years of marriage has not lessened their affection for each other. As they kiss, Edward tweaks her chin a special little way. The crowd APPLAUDS. Edward toasts the happy couple. Josephine covers well for her absent husband, a smile as warm as summer. We come into the middle of an argument on the sidewalk. Both men are a little drunk. A long beat, then. Will won't let him get the last word. ANGLE ON Edward. A hand to wave, enough of you. He walks away. ANGLE ON Will, still fuming with righteous anger. A typically busy day. On hold with the phone cradled under an ear, Will sorts through a bundle of mail dropped on his desk. Returning to the mail, he finds a hand-addressed envelope. Rips it open. At the table, Sandra talks on the phone while Edward fixes a sandwich. Edward takes a seat, starting to eat his sandwich. Sandra stands by the window, watching as. Edward swims laps in the family pool. He's born to the water. Edward stares intently into the water, a lion in wait. We LOOK DOWN at the river, where Edward's reflection is caught in the dark water. As the water ripples past, something changes. Sure enough, as we LOOK UP again, it's a younger EDWARD BLOOM, 20's, staring into the water.",
    "366": "Suddenly, everything RUSHES. The crowd becomes a blur, and the young woman is lost in its wake. Now it's Edward who's frozen, helpless in time. Edward checks in windows as cars pull out, searching for his fated love. Colossus is thumbing for a ride. The last pickup truck stops and lets him climb in back. As the truck pulls out, it passes a dejected Edward. He'll never find that girl, the love of his life. Amos leans over so Karl can sign a contract on his back. He spots Edward walking back into the tent. Amos hands off the contract to a CLOWN. As Amos starts to walk away, Edward hurries to catch up with him. He points to the bleachers, where no backpack is to be found. Getting in front of Amos, Edward stops him. Amos smiles, amused. Amos takes a long look at him. Ultimately, there's no way he can say no. He shrugs. Edward shakes Amos's hand before he can retract the offer. We move into a MONTAGE. CLOSE ON Edward, smiling nervously. His head is tilted to the side, and as we PULL BACK, we see why: he's holding it in a MASSIVE LION's open mouth. The beast's sharp teeth are just poking his skin. If the lion so much as flinches, Edward is dead. The CROWD applauds, which makes the lion antsy. Which makes Edward antsier. His eyes droopy from lack of sleep, Edward mans the whirling amusement park ride. Nodding off, Edward falls backward, into the path of the spinning arms. One of the Hydra cars hits him square in the gut, throwing him up and away, sailing 200 feet through the air. Amos is walking past. Amos stops, looks at the young man. Finally. He walks away. We PUSH IN on Edward, enraptured by the concept. Edward shovels shit in the nastiest stables you've ever seen. But all he can think about is. CLOSE ON Edward, lost in quiet reverie, pondering his latest bit of information. A sudden EXPLOSION as Edward is shot out of a giant cannon. Under a full moon, Edward walks up to the battered camper, and is about to knock when he notices it's rocking. A lot. But Edward KNOCKS anyway. Suddenly, the rocking and moaning stop. A beat, then the door handle begins to RATTLE. It seems to be stuck. Edward turns the knob. Suddenly, the door BURSTS OPEN. Edward is knocked down by a massive black dog, biggest you've ever seen. It has green glowing eyes and a lick of fire for a tongue. Edward wrestles with the beast, its mouth snapping at his throat. Blocking with an arm, Edward tries to push himself free, but the creature's hands -- it has hands instead of paws -- hold on tight.",
    "370": "Sandra checks the mail, hoping for a letter from Edward. A black car pulls up. Two ARMY OFFICERS get out. Hearing the news, Sandra CRIES OUT. Sandra hangs sheets to dry on the clotheslines, forming a tunnel of fabric. Pulling a dress out of the basket, Sandra looks up to see on the sheet in front of her. She freezes, watching the shadow ripple across the white fabric, blowing so softly in the breeze. She knows it can't be him. He's dead. She turns away. With all the strength she can gather, she hangs up that dress and digs another one out of the basket. Looking up, she sees not a shadow but Edward himself standing before her. She GASPS, disbelieving, but his hand is real. Without another moment's hesitation, she kisses him. We're under the covers, where a man's hand traces the curves of a woman's bare back. A beat, then she turns over in bed, revealing her to be. She blinks slowly, just waking up. Will is watching her. Edward is startled. Both women quickly gather plates. Will and Edward both smile. The women clearly want this to happen. It settles for a beat after they leave. Edward looks away, angry and disbelieving. With a skimmer pole, Will cleans the leaves and debris out of the pool, but it's a fool's errand. The pool has long since gone native, a shiny slick of algae on the surface, slime covering the cemented rocks. Suddenly, an underwater shape RIPPLES against the water's surface. Will is so startled that he drops the pole, which disappears into the murky water. He looks around, relieved that no one saw that. The doors open to reveal Sandra, Will and Josephine, staring into the mouth of oblivion. The storeroom is a museum of hasty decisions and half-finished projects: partially built outboard motors, dead bonsai trees, Frankensteinian lawnmowers. We also find boxes of products Edward used to sell. Clearing a path, Sandra leads Will to a roll-top desk, its ribs covered in dust. Two beaten metal file cabinets sit beside it. Looking through a new file, Sandra makes a small sound. A memory. Sandra hands Will a yellowed telegram. Will can't believe what he's reading. A beat, then Sandra stands. Josephine kisses him, then follows Sandra. Will re-reads the telegram, still bewildered. Looking for a place to put it, he tucks it into a strange mechanical hand on the desk. It clamps down automatically. We slowly PUSH IN on the telegram, held in the hand. Edward's VOICE begins as a memory. On a low platform, Edward pitches a brilliant new product to the crowd. Edward kisses his pregnant wife goodbye, as much in love as ever.",
    "374": "A beat, then we slowly. It's very early morning, and the first blue light of day is glowing through the vertical blinds. Still in his chair, Will wakes up a bit at a time. The notepad is on his lap, the pen in his hand. He cracks his neck, crooked from sleeping on it wrong. What woke him up? He looks to his right. Holds his gaze for a breath. His father is awake, silently GASPING for breath. His eyes are open, scared and confused. Edward shakes his head unambiguously. Edward nods. Will pours a glass from the pitcher on the nightstand. He holds it to his father's lips, but Edward won't drink. He pushes it away. He wanted something else. It takes Edward all his strength to put together each thought. It's like he's only half-there, fighting to hang on to this world. ON WILL, realizing. Edward nods. Edward looks around, confused and increasingly scared. He sees the end approaching, but doesn't know exactly what's coming. Without the story, he's lost. Fighting the urge to panic. Will looks around the room, increasingly desperate. He looks to the nurse call button. He really wants to press it. ON EDWARD, waiting for Will to begin. But Edward throws back the covers. Before he can answer, Will spots Edward rolling the chair himself, pumping both arms. Will dashes to catch up with him. The Heavyset Nurse leans out of Edward's hospital room. Seeing SECURITY GUARDS heading their way, a quick-thinking Sandra shoves a nearby cart into them, bowling them down. Will brakes hard, sliding with both feet. The chair nearly crashes into the back wall as the doors close. Will races Edward down the row, finally reaching the Chevrolet. Will lifts his father out of the chair. Will sets him in the passenger seat. Hands it off. Edward unscrews the cap, but instead of drinking it, he douses himself. Soaks the blanket. Will pops the trunk. TIGHT ON Edward, enjoying that detail. He's focused completely on Will's story. Will stops short, the traffic backed up. He HONKS, trying to get around the jam. Then, up ahead, the cars start moving, shoved aside by massive hands. It's Karl the Giant, clearing a path by brute force. Edward leans out the window and waves. Karl waves back. The same stretch of the river where it all began. A CROWD of more than 100 waiting. Amos Calloway is here with the circus folk, including Mr. Soggybottom. We also find Edward's Mother and Father, the Mayor, and many others from along the way. While Ping scans the horizon, Jing nuzzles with her boyfriend, Norther Winslow. It's Ping who first spots the Chevrolet. Will gets out of the Chevrolet, overwhelmed by the crowd.",
    "382": "He controls his breathing, trying to push through it. She returns with her camera. Edward smiles, doing a good job masking the pain. A devilish smile. We are where the second-rate carnival is parked for the moment in an Alabama field. He's still carrying the backpack we saw earlier, and scratched up from his trip through Spectre. Joining the crowd, he heads into the big-top. A troupe of STILT-WALKING FIREBREATHERS finishes their act to tremendous APPLAUSE. As the performers clear away, the circus' owner-and-ringmaster AMOS CALLOWAY (50) approaches the stands. He may only be four feet tall, but Amos has a titanic presence. From behind Amos, CARNIES start rolling a massive ball towards the crowd. Amos comes up to a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN in the first row, a quieter moment. The carnies back away from the ball as a deep DRUM ROLL begins. A moment, then the ball starts to bulge from inside. A foot suddenly bursts out from within. GASPS from the crowd. That foot is massive. In the stands, Edward looks closer. As the drum beat intensifies, a second foot breaks out. Followed by hands. Shoulders. Finally, the head. From a very LOW ANGLE, we look up to see just how massive he is. He seems to fill the Heavens. With his shaved head and giant club, he seems more ogre than man. In the bandstands, a YOUNG BOY's jaw drops in awe. A tight spotlight follows him, revealing faces in the crowd. Colossus passes Edward, who seems unimpressed. He leans with the spotlight, WHISTLING to get the big man's attention. He points to the edge of the stands, where his friend is sitting on the dirt. stands up, so big the spotlight has to widen just to hold him. He's a good foot taller than Colossus. There's a GASP from the crowd, along with nervous anticipation -- what will happen next? ANGLE ON Amos, stunned, megaphone dangling. ANGLE ON Colossus, realizing the gig is up. With a resigned shrug, he rests his club on his shoulder and walks away into the shadows. As the stands empty, Edward and Karl talk to Amos. As Amos pulls Karl aside to give him the hard sell, Edward notices a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN (16) leaving with her family. She's wearing a blue dress and hat. For no good reason, she looks back at Edward. The two make eye contact. And as they do, all motion FREEZES. A fiery baton remains mid-twirl, flames locked in place. A spilled box of popcorn hangs in mid-air, each kernel like a snowflake. Only Edward is free to move, winding his way between the frozen bodies, ducking underneath arms to get closer and closer to this woman.",
    "384": "The Dude is hurled against the chief's desk, which he bounces off of, to come to rest more or less seated in a facing chair. His wallet is tossed onto the desk. The chief leans forward, takes the wallet and sorts through it with disgusted incredulity. He is looking at the Ralph's Shopper's Club card. The Dude stares. The Chief hurls his steaming mug of coffee at the Dude. It hits him in the forehead with a thud, the scalding coffee splashing everywhere. The Chief is already up off his chair, rounding the desk. He kicks the chair out from under the Dude, and then starts kicking at him. The Dude, in the back seat of a taxicab that rocks and squeaks with every bump, is gingerly touching at sore spots on his face and scalp. The back of the driver, a large black man with rasta dreds under a knit cap. The place is a wreck. Furniture has been overturned, upholstery slashed, drawers dumped. Quiet. Maude emerges from the bedroom. She is wearing a bathrobe. She pulls open the bathrobe as she approaches. The Dude is stupefied. A match is dragged across a headboard; the Dude is lighting himself a joint. He climbs out of bed but Maude remains in it. She wedges a pillow into the small of her back and clasps a hand on each kneecap. She pulls her knees in toward her chest to keep her pelvis raised. He picks a White Russian off the bedside table. The Dude spits some White Russian. The Dude is staring off into space, thinking. The Dude is leaving the bedroom. The man nervously complies. The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit. He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache. The Dude shouts to cover his fear. The Dude is stunned. He is fumbling in his wallet. The Dude looks at the picture. It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. He is holding out another picture. A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape. He hands back the picture. The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. Four people sit at a booth: Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age. A waitress enters with a checkpad and pen.",
    "386": "Music and head credits play over various bowling shots--pins flying, etc. Bowlers are seen hoisting balls, sliding feet, with graceful releases and balls gliding down lanes. A ball return spins up a ball. They turn to leave, scattered by a strike. The music turns into boomy source music, coming from a distant jukebox, as the credits end over a clattering strike. A lanky blonde man with stringy hair tied back in a ponytail turns from the strike to walk back to the bench. We are tracking in on the circular bench towards a big man nursing a large plastic cup of Bud. He has dark worried eyes and a goatee. Hairy legs emerge from his khaki shorts. He also wears a khaki army surplus shirt with the sleeves cut off over an old bowling shirt. Donny, the strike-scoring bowler, enters and sits next Walter. The Dude, also holding a large plastic cup of Bud, wears some of its foam on his mustache. Reflected in the plaque we see the Dude entering the room with a YOUNG MAN. We pull back from the name JEFFREY LEBOWSKI engraved in silver to reveal that the plaque, from Variety Clubs International, honors Lebowski as ACHIEVER OF THE YEAR. The Dude, wearing shorts and a bowling shirt, turns to look. So does Brandt, the young man we've been listening to. He wears a suit and has his hands clasped in front of his groin. Our continuing track and pan have brought us onto a framed Life Magazine cover which is headlined ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER? Oddly, the Dude's sunglassed face is on it; we realize that, under the magazine's logo and headline, the display is mirrored. Entering the room is a fat sixtyish man in a motorized wheelchair--Jeff Lebowski. He wheels himself behind a desk. The Dude sits facing him as Brandt withdraws. The Dude rises. The Dude is heading for the door. As the Dude opens the door. The Dude shuts the door on the old man's bellowing to find himself. A houseman with a rolled-up carpet on one shoulder goes down a stone walk that winds through the back lawn, past a swimming pool to a garage. Brandt and the Dude follow. Arcing around the woman's foot as she finishes painting the nails emerald green. Looking. The young woman looks up at him. She is in her early twenties. She leans back and extends her leg toward the Dude. The Dude pulls his sunglasses down his nose and peeks over them. The Dude tentatively grabs hold of her extended foot. She waggles her foot and giggles. The Dude looks over at the pool. The man bobbing in the inflatable chair is passed out. He is thin, in his thirties, with long stringy blond hair.",
    "389": "As the picture fades in the bowling noises continue, but filtered and faint. We are close on the Dude, upside down. As the Dude opens his eyes we spiral slowly upward to put him right side around. His head is now resting against hardwood floor, not rug. The rug is gone. We push Brandt down the familiar marble hallway. We pan off the Dude, driving, to his point of view through the front windshield. The headlights play over Walter standing waiting in front of the storefront of SOBCHAK SECURITY. Though he is wearing khaki shorts and shirt, the fact that he holds a battered brown briefcase makes him look oddly like a commuter. He also holds an irregular shape bundled in brown wrapping paper. The car stops in front of him and he opens the Dude's door and hands in the briefcase. The Dude takes the briefcase and slides over. He raises himself onto his elbows and massages the red lump on his jaw. The Dude unclips the phone from the battery pack. The Dude glares at Walter. Walter stares dumbly for a beat. The Dude is twisting around to pull the money briefcase from the back seat. Walter reaches one arm across Dude's body to grab the laundry. There is the bump and new steady of the car on the bridge. He flings it out the window. Walter points across the seat at the paper-wrapped bundle. Walter has flung open his door and is leaning halfway out over the road. Walter rolls out with his parcel, giving a loud grunt as he hits the pavement. The car swerves and lurches and the Dude, cursing, takes the wheel. Walter tumbles onto the shoulder and--RAT-TAT-TAT-TAT!--muzzle flashes tear open the wrapping paper. The car rocks and the Dude wrestles with the wheel. The car clunks and screams around in a skid. The Dude is thrown forward as the car hits something. As the Dude struggles out holding the satchel of money. The Dude runs up the road toward the bridge, frantically waving the satchel in the air. WALTER is just rising from the ground massaging an injured knee. The Dude and Walter stand in the middle of the road, watching the three red tail lights fishtail away. He turns from the lane to where the Dude sits in the nook of molded plastic chairs. The Dude listlessly holds the portable phone in his lap. Donny is trotting excitedly up. The Dude gets to his feet with the portable phone. He waves both arms as if conducting a symphony orchestra. The three bowlers, stopped at the edge of the lot, stare out at an empty parking space. The Dude walks away across the lot.",
    "39": "SYLVIE GAUDET, French, attractive, blonde, in her early thirties, comes from the railing of the sun deck to join REGGIE and JEAN-LOUIS. JEAN-LOUIS scampers off, content to have gotten off so lightly. SYLVIE notices REGGIE's lunch which consists of cold chicken, potato salad, rolls and butter, wine and coffee. REGGIE picks up a chicken leg and starts off. SYLVIE regards the devastated table before following. A magnificent indoor, glass-enclosed pool, the vista of snow-covered mountains seen through the ceiling-high windows beyond. REGGIE and SYLVIE are passing through, their conversation continuing. An open balcony running around two sides of the pool, sun-worshippers lying in deck-chairs. REGGIE and SYLVIE appear, their conversation continuing. She stops as she is aware of a weird figure hovering over her. A strange, grotesque knitted mask that completely covers the face except for eyes, nose and mouth. CAMERA PANS down to include JEAN-LOUIS, his hand held firmly by the man in the mask. Including REGGIE, MAN, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. Eyeing one, then the other, SYLVIE sizes up the situation and rises. SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS start off, but not before the boy squirts PETER with his pistol. The Arc de Triomphe at the far end of the Avenue. CAMERA PANS to pick up a TAXI as it pulls up before the handsome building. Inside are REGGIE, SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS. As REGGIE climbs out and the DRIVER begins unloading her suitcases. JEAN-LOUIS sticks his head out of the taxi window. REGGIE looks at SYLVIE, surprised. REGGIE walks toward the house with the driver, who carries her cases. She presses the button that electrically opens the front door. As the elevator rises REGGIE gets out, followed by the driver. He puts down the bags in front of the apartment door. The driver leaves. Sighing, she digs out her keys and starts to fit it into the lock. Now, CAMERA FOLLOWING, she goes into the Salon. It is also empty -- stripped bare. There are squares of the wall's original color where paintings used to hang, the hooks still in the wall. She rushes now, going into the bedroom, CAMERA FOLLOWING crazily, lurching and careening behind her. The bedroom, too, is empty. She goes to the built-in wardrobe closets and throws open all the doors. Only some hangers remain. She pulls open the drawers -- nothing. Including REGGIE, in a state of near-shock. We see a large metal drawer being opened and an all-too-familiar shape outlined under a damp sheet of muslin. Looking straight down at the tops of REGGIE's, GRANDPIERRE's and an ATTENDANT's head and smack into the open drawer. GRANDPIERRE lifts a corner of the sheet at the bottom and reveals a bare foot with a ticket tied to its big toe.",

The Dude waits for the rings to end. Facing him on the couch are two uniformed policeman, one middle-aged, the other a fresh-faced rookie. loft. A huge unfinished canvas, lit by standing industrial lights, dominates one wall. The Dude, standing in the middle of the loft, looks into the murky depths of the cavernous space. The Dude turns again as he hears running footsteps. Something huge and white hurtles towards the Dude's head. As it roars overhead he ducks, and spins to watch it pass. We see the backside of a naked woman in a sling suspended from a ceiling track rumbling over a canvas that lies on the floor. She is holding a paint bucket in one hand and a brush in the other, with which she flicks paint down at the canvas. Two young men in paint-spattered shorts, T-shirts and sneakers reach the sling shortly after it reaches the end of its track and haul it back for another push. The furnishings are spare given the space. On the floor is the Dude's brilliant rug. She is aiming a remote at a projection TV. The screen flickers to life. On the TV screen the door opens to reveal a sallow-faced man in blue cover-alls. It is Dieter, the floater in Lebowski's pool. The Dude is at the bar, a bottle of kalhua frozen halfway to his glass. The Dude sits in back holding a White Russian, listening to the chauffeur, a man of about the same age from whose livery cap a ponytail emerges. He takes a sip of a freshly-mixed White Russian, which leaves milk on his mustache. I was feeling really shitty earlier in the day, I'd lost a little money, I was down in the dumps. The limo has rolled to a stop. The Dude gets out, still holding his drink. His eyes on the rearview mirror, Tony jerks a thumb over his shoulder. The Dude turns to look. He scowls. Halfway up the block a Volkswagon bug has pulled over to the curb. In the driver's seat we see a fat man's shape. The Dude is grabbed from behind and muscled away in a half-nelson by another uniformed chauffeur. As he is frog-marched towards another limo the Dude holds his drink away from his chest and cups a hand underneath it. The waiting limo's back door is flung open. The Dude is shoved in and awkwardly takes a seat facing the rear. Brandt sits catty-corner from the Dude; directly across from the Dude is the big Lebowski, a comforter across his knees.",
    "394": "He puts his arm around her and drags her on. He holds her hand. They settle on a tall dark-haired man in a dark jacket. He nods. He comes to a small canvas tent with a sign on it - TOILET. Jody walks inside the canvas flap and vanishes from sight. She leans against the canvas, looking bored. She stands there, listening to the sound of him urinate. Her eyes flick around the carnival. He staggers out, buttoning up. He goes to kiss her. She turns her head away. She pulls him over toward the water. Jody follows her, as she walks backward, drawing him on. We can still see his hand, holding Jude's. He moves his hips to a song as Jude leads him over the beach, under a train trestle. He sinks down on his knees toward her. She wraps her arms around his neck and kisses him. Jody writhes on top of her, fumbling with his belt. Jude cocks one eye upward. A shadow falls across them. A gun is put to his head. He turns around, drunkenly. The gun whacks him across the cheek and he falls sideways. Jude scrambles to her feet and darts like an animal through a field. Jody feels his cheek. He can see her blond head vanishing among the fields. He looks up and sees a group of men around him. The tallest of them, Fergus, cocks the gun. A mini, driving down a country road. Two men in the front, three in the back. On the floor of the car Jody lies, with three pairs of feet on top of him, a black bag over his head and the barrel of a gun dangling close to his face. Fergus holds the gun. He is smoking a cigarette. His movements are slow and somewhat innocent. Jody pulled through and tied to a chair. Maguire, a small lean man, talks to him through the hood. Jody is motionless under the black hood. All the men are drinking tea. The blond woman comes in with a plate and some food on it. Jody sits as still as a grave, saying nothing. Fergus is sitting by a chair, gun in his hand, watching the prisoner. Jude comes in, with a flashlight. She moves over to him. She prods him in the legs with her foot. Then she lifts the hood ever so slightly, to peer inside. Suddenly the man moves like lightning, jerking his head down so the hood comes off, throwing his body, tied to the chair, over Jude. He pins her to the ground, his body bent with the chair. He writhes on top of her in a grotesque parody of love.",
    "395": "Outside the restaurant, Dil and Fergus make their way to their seats at the bar. A figure sits down at the bar. As they pass Jude, she smiles. In the background, we see Jude rising. Fergus marches Dil away. They pass out of shot. She looks at Col. There are tears in her eyes. She stands. She staggers out of the pub. Fergus sits there. There is an expression in Col's eyes that makes Fergus feel very, very small. But Fergus rises and walks out. Fergus looks toward it, but Jude is standing there, waiting. Jude grabs his arm. She draws him down an alley where the same car is waiting. They get inside. Dil, sitting inside a taxi, watches Fergus and Jude getting in the car. Jude is driving, Maguire next to her. Fergus sits in the back. Maguire stubs his cigarette out on Fergus's hand, then whacks him on the teeth with his closed fist. Jude drives. The car draws to a halt in a sedate square. Several doors down is the entrance to what looks like a sedate conservative club. In the car, Maguire turns off the engine. He nods toward the building. He nods toward a car, a Daimler, parked some distance away. Fergus looks from the window to the car. Jude turns around to look at him. Jude and Fergus get out of the car. They walk down the street, down from the brothel-cum-club, where there is a cafe-bar with some tables outside. Fergus and Jude, crossing the street, take their seats by the tables. We can see the brothel down the way. She checks her watch. Fergus is sweating. Down by the brothel, the door swings open. Fergus walks like any pedestrian down toward the brothel. There is an old, portly gent in a City suit emerging from it. The car by the pavement kicks into action and the door opens. Fergus quickens his pace. Jude, by the cafe, watches. Fergus, walking. The gent makes his way, with gout-ridden slowness, across the pavement, through the passersby, toward the car. A burly security man emerges from the car, walking toward the old gent. Fergus reaches the car just before he does, and passes between him and the open door. The old gent's stomach brushes Fergus's elbow. Fergus walks on. Jude, from the cafe, watches--Fergus walking on, the old man being eased with painstaking care inside the Daimler. Then the door closing and the Daimler pulling off. When the Daimler has passed Fergus, he turns around and walks back. Jude smiles and leaps up as he approaches. Jude begins to walk away. She leaves. Dil watches her go. Fergus turns around to see Dil in front of the cafe.",
    "401": "Jody runs, whipping through the trees--always ahead of him. The old man pours whiskey into a teacup. He pours Fergus more whiskey. The ferry churns into the sunset. FADE UP into an elegant, empty Georgian room, covered in clouds of dust. A figure among the clouds of dust hacks at a wall with a sledgehammer. It is Fergus, dressed in laborer's overalls, covered in dust. He knocks the bricks from an outer wall. He works furiously and relentlessly, like a machine. We see the wall, with the hammer striking it. One brick falls away, then another. Daylight pours through the clouds of dust and the growing hole. More bricks fall away. Through the clouds of dust and the streams of daylight, we now see a patch of green. His rhythm slows. More bricks fall away. Then the hammer stops. The dust begins to clear. The dust drifts across it, revealing a cricket pitch, with tiny sticklike figures running on the green. Fergus, returning from work, crosses the street, and enters through a white door. Fergus dresses. He puts on a cheap suit, like any country boy in a big city. He takes Jody's wallet from the trousers of his overalls. He flips it open, sees the picture of the soldier and Dil. He puts it in the pocket of his suit. Fergus walks down a street looking for an address. Some distance down the street is a sign -- MILLIE'S UNISEX HAIR. Fergus, standing as the crowds go by him, looks in the window. He has the picture in his hand. We see Dil from his point of view, then Fergus walks inside. Fergus enters. She leaves the salon. Dil checks her watch and stubs out a cigarette. She comes toward him and fiddles with his hair. She pushes his head back into a basin behind him. She begins to knead his hair in hot water and shampoo. The hands with the purple nails run over his scalp. Fergus sits up. She begins to cut. She imitates his accent saying it. Fergus laughs. Dil raises Fergus's head up, with his new-cut hair and holds a mirror up behind his head so he can see the back. He looks like a young London stockbroker. He walks off through the crowds and then ducks into a doorway. Dil comes out, dressed in a pair of high heels, a very short skirt, different, more raunchy clothes on her than we saw inside. She locks the glass door and walks down the street, across the road, and into a pub called the Metro. Fergus follows. Dil makes her way through it. She sits down at the bar. Fergus comes toward the bar and takes a seat.",
    "402": "Dil, looking at Fergus. Fergus blushes. He buries himself in his drink. Fergus throws his eyes toward her again. She has her face turned away, but sees him in the mirror. She eyes Fergus in the mirror. The barman, with infinite weariness, approaches Fergus. Fergus is about to talk when she pipes up. The barman mixes it. She stares at the mirror, staring at Fergus, who is trying to avoid her eyes. The barman hands her the drink. A burly man sits down beside her. She slaps the hand away. She turns back to Fergus and finds his seat empty. Fergus, standing across the road from the pub. He is sweating. Dil comes out of the pub. She looks this way and that, as if searching for Fergus. Fergus stands back into a shadow. Dave, the burly man, comes out. He grabs her by the elbow. She walks off. Dave follows, grabs her by the elbow again. Dave walking, holding Dil by the arm. The street is dilapidated, full of squats. They stop outside a door. Dil opens the door with a key from her purse and they both walk inside. Fergus stands there, observing. A light comes on in an upstairs room. Dil enters; we see her shadow in silhouette behind the curtain and the shadow of Dave coming in behind her. He begins to remove her blouse. She stands absolutely still as he does so. Fergus, in bed. Fade to black as we see Jody as a bowler, running in slow motion, toward the camera. He releases the ball; we see Fergus in bed, breathing heavily. Fergus takes a break and watches the batsman hit a ball. He imitates the batsman's motion with his sledgehammer. Then a voice interrupts him. Fergus turns. We see Tristram Deveroux, a young Sloane type in a three-piece suit, whose house it is. Beside him is Franknum, the cockney foreman. Fergus resumes work. It is now crowded with people, black, white, punky and street chic, a lot of leather. All the women are heavily made-up. From the way Fergus walks through, it is obvious he has never been here at night. He seems most out of place in his cheap suit, making his way through the crowd to the bar. Col, the barman, sees him and smiles. Col pushes a colored cocktail with one of those Japanese umbrellas toward him. Fergus reaches for his wallet to pay, but Col interrupts. Fergus tries to pretend he's familiar with the drink, and by implication, whatever are the norms of the place. He lifts the glass to his mouth, but the umbrella keeps getting in the way. Fergus takes out the umbrella. He holds it in one hand and drinks with the other.",
    "403": "Fergus shrugs. She looks at Fergus directly, sits down next to him. Fergus says nothing. He shrugs. The burly man comes up to her. He suddenly jerks her roughly off the stool, spilling her drink. He drags her through the crowd. The barman eyes him. Fergus suddenly stands and makes his way to the door. Fergus comes out. He walks a few yards and hears voices down an alley. He looks up it. We see Dil pushing Dave away. He grabs her, turns her roughly. She beats his arms away. She staggers away from him. They both bump into Fergus, who just stands there and doesn't move an inch. She smiles. He holds it up to show her. Dave eyes Fergus. Fergus grabs his wrists and upends him on the ground. Fergus puts his foot on Dave's neck. Fergus presses down his foot. He looks to Dil. Fergus presses his foot. She bends low to Dave. But his voice is softer. Fergus removes his foot. Dil grabs his arm. She draws him away. They walk out of the alley. Fergus looks back. Dave is rising. Fergus and Dil climb slowly upstairs. There is a movement lower down the staircase. We see Dave, holding his neck. Dil leans close to Fergus. She tilts up her face. Fergus kisses her, tenderly. She goes in and closes the door. Fergus stands and looks down at Dave, who turns to leave. Dil walks out of the salon, smiling, and walks toward Fergus. Fergus takes a bunch of flowers from behind his back. She holds them, with theatrical feeling. She laughs and leans toward him and kisses him in a classically old-fashioned way. The girls inside the salon pull back a curtain, and they all clap. She takes his arm and walks off with him. Fergus and Dil looking at their menus. A waiter places drinks on their table, then leaves. They are walking in an alleyway toward her house. And suddenly a car drives very fast toward them, headlights on. Fergus pulls her into a doorway to avoid it. The car continues down the road, stops, and then screeches off. She looks down toward where the car has pulled away. A car pulls up behind Dil and Fergus. She touches his cheek. Dil comes in in the darkness. Fergus stands like a shadow in the doorway. The light comes on; she takes off her raincoat. Fergus enters slowly. He looks around the room; there is an exaggerated femininity about everything in it. Fergus looks at the mantelpiece and sees a picture of Jody. The camera tracks into the soldier's smiling face. His reverie is broken by the sound of a voice outside--Dave's. She opens the window door, and we see Dave on the street, in a neck brace.",
    "405": "She turns toward him and undoes her hair. It falls around her shoulders. Fergus runs his hand down her throat. She draws him behind a curtain toward the bed, pulls him down. They kiss passionately. She walks into the bathroom. Fergus lies there, looking at the picture, listening to the sound of running water. She comes out then, dressed in a silk kimono. She looks extraordinarily beautiful. He draws her toward him. He begins to kiss her face and neck. She murmurs no. His hands slip the wrap down from her shoulders. Then the hands stop. The kimono falls to the floor gently, with a whisper. The camera travels with it, and we see, in a close-up, that she is a man. Fergus sits there, frozen, staring at her. Fergus says nothing. She gives a strange little laugh, then reaches out to touch him. Fergus smacks the hand away. He gets up and runs to the bathroom. She grabs his feet. He kicks her away. He runs into the bathroom and vomits into the tub. She lights a cigarette. Fergus slams the door shut. She is sitting on the couch, the kimono round her once more, looking very much like a woman. A trace of blood on her mouth. Fergus comes out of the bathroom. She looks up. Some hope in her face. And he makes to go. She grabs him to stop him. He pulls away from her. She falls to the floor. Fergus sits. Col turns to him. Fergus touches her arm. She whips her arm away. She walks into the crowd, toward the door. Fergus leaves. Fergus, walking outside Dil's place. The blinds in her room are down and the light is on inside. We see her outline, pacing up and down behind the blinds, smoking a cigarette. A man removes a large number six from a huge scoreboard with a pole and replaces it with a number nine. Below the scoreboard we can see Dil walking across a lawn toward the building where Fergus is working. Fergus, fitting a new window into the finished wall. On the pitch we see the cricketers, distorted through the moving glass of the window. Across the pitch Dil walks, with a lunch basket in her hand, dressed in a very short skirt with high heels. As she approaches the site a chorus of whistles breaks out. Fergus, hearing the whistling, stares out. He sees Dil moving toward the site. He drops the window and the glass shatters. As the whistles continue, we see Dil in the site's lift, which rises up. We see Deveroux and Franknum climbing up a ladder toward Fergus. Through this conversation Fergus can hear the chorus of wolf whistles increasing.",
    "409": "Standing poised by the door. The classroom doors open and students start to file out. Elaine comes out of the classroom. Elaine starts walking down the corridor towards the exit door. Ben follows her, moving out of the way of the other students. Elaine and twenty other girls are in basketball uniforms. Elaine sits on the bench, watching. Ben stands behind her. She turns and looks at him. Elaine jumps up, applauding a shot. Elaine and several other girls run onto the court as a number of girls run off the court to the bench. Ben is seated across a study table from Elaine. There are many other students scattered around the room. She starts to get up. She starts to move away. Ben and Elaine are standing at the entrance. Ben remains standing in exactly the same position. After a few moments the door opens and Elaine comes out, steps quickly to Ben, kisses him, then runs back inside. Ben turns and starts away from the door. A tall bearded MAN comes out and goes past Ben. Through the window of a hippy jewelry store we see a saleswoman modeling a ring for Ben. He nods, she takes it off, puts it in a box and gives it to him. He pays for it and exits PAST CAMERA, WHISTLING. Ben enters carrying four oddly shaped boxes and some flowers. Ben is whistling happily as he runs up the stairs two at a time. He opens the door to his room and steps in. The room is dark. The figure of a MAN is silhouetted against the window. Ben freezes just inside the door. Ben takes a step forward. Mr. Robinson stands at the door. Mr. Robinson opens the door and starts into the hall. Mr. Robinson turns back from the hall. Mr. Robinson starts down the stairs. Mr. McCleery is standing on the stairway, listening. Mr. Robinson turns and goes down the stairs, past Mr. McCleery who looks up at Ben. He walks to the door, looks out into the hall at Mr. McCleery, then shuts the door. Ben stuffs the money back in his pocket and runs down the stairs and out of the building. Through the door we see him run down the street and out of sight. Ben reacting. The elevator at the end of the hall opens and a fat GIRL walks toward us with an envelope in her hand. She walks into CAMERA. Ben driving his car SOUND: An ENVELOPE being read. Ben follows her through the hall into Mrs. Robinson's room. Mrs. Robinson, without stopping, puts Elaine's clothes down next to a half-packed open suitcase on her bed and moves to a telephone on the night table.",
    "411": "Across the fence on the other side of the house, a quartet of adults, formally dressed as though for a cocktail party, are holding drinks and watching. One of them holds a baby. The Braddocks, the Arnolds and their children are dressed in California Contemporary Sport Style: the adults in styles infinitely too young for them, the children in styles infinitely too old for them. Mr. Braddock stands alone at the end of the pool near the house. The others are grouped, more or less, at the other end. Mr. Braddock is hamming it up. Mr. Braddock has moved over by one of the windows of the house, the window into the kitchen. He speaks quickly -- in a fake sotto voce -- towards the window. But Mr. Braddock has already moved away from the window and is readdressing his audience. They laugh; Mrs. Arnold makes a face at Mr. Arnold as he grinningly acknowledges the response to his snappy comeback. Mr. Braddock darts back to the window. Mr. Braddock moves to the screen door and pushes it open. It slams against the wall inside. At the back of the hall, inside the house, stands Ben, dressed in a full length skin diver's wet suit, flippers on his feet, the oxygen tank strapped to his back, the mask pushed up his forehead, the air hose dangling. He holds a spear gun in his hand. The people applaud. The people in the backyard. His father stands just outside the screen door. Ben's arms come into view and pull the mask down. We are now looking through the mask as we MOVE FORWARD down the hall. Everything is slightly distorted through the glass. Ben's hand comes up again with the breathing apparatus in it. We MOVE out of the door and toward the pool. Mr. Braddock is running back and forth, clapping his hands and delivering his now soundless pitch. We MOVE DOWN the steps and into the shallow end of the pool. Mr. Braddock is moving along the side of the pool, motioning toward us to come down to the deep end. He joins Mr. Arnold at the far end of the pool. They both begin to motion us toward them. We get to the deep end of the pool. He has a big smile. We SURFACE again and PAN AROUND for a last look. The figures, through the slightly distorted glass of the mask of Mrs. Arnold and Mrs. Braddock, watching and smiling; the neighbors on each side of the house, looking over their fences and laughing and pointing; Mr. Arnold nodding encouragement and talking; Mr. Braddock on his knees, smiling and trying to reach out far enough to push us under.",
    "412": "We go under and sink to the bottom of the pool. Looking down on the pool, on Ben's black suited body at the bottom and the people standing around the pool, looking down into it. In a phone booth. The booth is in the entrance area of the hotel between the lobby and the driveway. Ben holds the receiver to his ear. Ben hangs up slowly. He stands up in the booth, looks around, moves about uncomfortably for a few moments, removes his jacket and carrying it folded across his arm in front of him, leaves the phone booth and crosses to the doors that lead to the main lobby. As he is about to go in, the doors open and a group of very old people start coming out, filling the doorway and moving very slowly, muttering to each other and helping each other out of the door and down the steps. Ben holds one of the doors open for them and stands politely to one side. As they get through, Ben starts to move inside. At that moment, a dozen young people, dressed as though for a high school dance, push him to one side and move past him into the lobby. He moves back against the other door, holding it open and allowing them to go in first. He smiles politely and they pay no attention to him at all. He follows them into the lobby. They move toward the front desk and he moves with them. One of the boys at the front of the group leans in and says something to the clerk behind the desk. The clerk points across the lobby and says something to him. He points vaguely in the direction of the other young people. Terror and disbelief start in Ben's eyes. He looks helplessly at the clerk. She grasps Ben's hand and shakes it. Miss DeWitte, who, from the looks of things, always has been and always will be, Miss DeWitte, takes Ben's hand. Ben finds himself shaking the twelve-year-old boy's hand. Ben switches to Mr. Singleman's hand. Mrs. Singleman looks at the seating list she has been holding. Ben is backing out. He rises quickly. They sit down. Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table. Ben looks toward a passing waiter and raises his hand. Ben looks back at Mrs. Robinson apologetically. The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them. The waiter moves to their table. The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson. The waiter moves away. Ben watches him go. He shakes his head. Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby. Ben walks to the front desk and stands there.",
    "413": "He pushes the card and a pen toward Ben. Ben writes his name on the card and then stares at it for a moment, crumples it up and fills out a second card. Ben reaches for the key. He hands Ben the key. A waiter is standing next to the table with a telephone. Mrs. Robinson turns in her chair and looks through the glass into the lobby. Ben is in the phone booth in the lobby no more than twenty feet away. Over Ben's shoulder, we can see his face reflected in the glass door and, through it, Mrs. Robinson sitting in the Veranda Room. He hangs up. He leaves the phone booth and walks back into the main lobby. As he passes the desk, on his way to the elevator, he starts to pat his breast pocket. The desk clerk looks up. He clears his throat and then he kisses her. Ben opens the closet door. She turns her back. He undoes the zipper at her neck. She turns and looks at him. He backs away. He slams the bathroom door shut. The light in the room disappears. The midsummer sun beats down on the Braddock swimming pool and on Ben who lies on a rubber raft in the middle of the pool. Ben wears dark glasses, is deeply tanned, and holds a beer can in one hand. Ben opens his eyes and moves his head slightly. Mr. Braddock is passionately stoking a barbeque fire. Mrs. Braddock is going toward him from the house, carrying some ominously large thing wrapped in tinfoil. He rolls off the raft and swims to the end of the pool. He climbs out, walks to the back door, takes his shirt from a chair and starts to put it on as he opens the back door and goes through. Ben has just shut the door to the bathroom behind him. He is wearing his shirt, buttoned, and no trousers. PAN WITH BEN as he walks across the room past Mrs. Robinson who is standing in front of the bureau taking off her bracelet and watch. He moves to a chair and sits. Mrs. Robinson moves in to Ben, kneels in front of him and starts to unbutton his shirt. We now see behind Ben the door that leads from the Braddock den, in which Ben is sitting. In the dining room, Mr. and Mrs. Braddock are sitting, having their dinner, looking through the doorways toward Ben. Ben stands, crosses back to the door to the den and shuts it. On Ben's back as he returns to the chair and sits. A television set, facing the chair, is on. Ben picks up a can of beer and drinks from it.",
    "415": "Mrs. Robinson is sitting there. Mr. Robinson exits. Ben and Elaine are in Ben's car from the back. Ben leans forward slightly, pushing the car recklessly in and out of the traffic. He leans on the horn. The car directly ahead of him does not move to the right. Ben jerks his car over to the right, swerves around the car ahead, jamming his horn down, and swerves back into the outside lane, giving the driver of the other car an angry look as he passes him. Elaine holds on to the dashboard to keep her balance. Ben and Elaine are seated at a table. Elaine sits in the chair with her back to the stage. She folds her hands on the table and looks down at them. The two chairs are slightly angled toward each other so that Ben can look up at the stage without looking directly at Elaine. The stripper is reflected in Ben's glasses. She is down to a tasseled bra and g-string. She is twirling the tassels. Elaine turns around, looks at the stripper and turns back. Elaine leans against the side of the building and pulls her arm away. Ben, facing her, keeps moving from side to side, trying to get her to look at him. She keeps looking away. She starts to cry. People on the sidewalk are looking at them. She turns away from them. Ben moves away from them. Ben moves around in front of her. She brings both hands up to her face. Ben looks at her for a few moments in agony. Then, very determined, he takes her wrists in his hands and pulls them away from her face. She looks up startled. She starts to give a little cry but before she can he is kissing her. She closes her eyes. He brings his fists, containing her hands, up to the side of her face. He opens his hands against her face, freeing her hands. Her hands move slowly to his wrists and hang on. After a while she pulls away, turning her head slightly to one side. He looks at her. She is watching him carefully. A car with a couple of teenagers has driven up in the slot on their right. Its radio is tuned into a rock and roll station and it is playing loudly. Ben leans across Elaine and speaks through the window to the kid behind the wheel. The kid turns the radio up. Ben and Elaine roll their windows up. From outside of car. Ben is talking with great animation -- Elaine is watching him. They are both eating as Ben talks, telling Elaine a story. Their windows are rolled up.",
    "416": "The car coasts silently to a stop in front of the Robinson house. They sit there for a long time without saying anything, Ben's hand touching her shoulder. There is a SQUEAL of TIRES as Ben almost drives off the road. Ben and Elaine enter the lobby and stand just inside the door. They start in a few steps. ONE of the CAR PARKERS passes them on his way out. CAMERA BEGINS TO PULL UP AND AWAY. A BELLBOY passes them. The room clerk smiles at them. Ben and Elaine stop a few feet into the center of the lobby. The CAMERA PULLS BACK to a HIGH OVERHEAD SHOT revealing many people moving back and forth in the lobby, passing Ben and Elaine. Ben brings Elaine through the door to the porch. Ben and Elaine in his car. He takes his hand off the ignition, jams on the accelerator and drives the car speedily for twenty-one feet and jams on the brakes. He turns off the ignition and the lights. He puts his head down on the steering wheel. He lifts his head. She nods. He turns the key in the ignition and starts the car. He freezes with his hand still on the key. He turns off the engine. He starts the car and drives out. It is raining. On the seat beside Ben is a package. From the way it is wrapped, we can tell it is a gift. Ben's right hand is on it as he drives. Past Ben and through the windshield as the Robinson house comes closer and closer. The front door of the Robinson house opens and Mrs. Robinson comes out, dressed in a housecoat, and, in four or five fast steps, reaches the car, opens the door on the passengers side and climbs in. Ben starts the car forward down the driveway. As they drive. Ben stops the car in front of a house halfway down the block. There is a pause while Ben looks at her expression. Then he grabs the keys out of the ignition, opens the door on his side and jumps out of the car, carrying the package. TRACK WITH BEN as he runs up the street and up the driveway toward the Robinson house. Ben gets to the front door. Ben runs up the stairs. He still carries the package. Ben gets to the top just as Elaine comes out of the door to her bedroom. She is wearing a skirt and slip and carrying one shoe. Ben pushes her back into her room. Ben turns and looks. Mrs. Robinson is just entering the house. He holds her against the wall in the corner. Back in the corner.",
    "417": "Mrs. Robinson's face appears in the crack in the door at Elaine's shoulder. Elaine looks from Ben's face to the crack through which she can see her mother's eyes staring. She moves toward him as though to hit him. Elaine SLAMS the door shut. Mrs. Robinson stands at the end of it, looking at Ben. He looks at her in horror. She gets further and further away as though it is a very long hall in a very bad dream. Ben sits cross-legged on his bed in the dark, his back against the fishtank, smoking. Ben drives by in his car. He looks at the house. Ben dressed differently, stands by the window overlooking the backyard. Over his shoulder, we can see Mr. Braddock down by the pool, dressed in a sweater, cleaning the pool with a long-handled scoop. Mr. Braddock looks up at Ben's window. Ben moves aside. Ben is standing behind a tree watching the Robinson house. In the driveway of the Robinson house, Elaine is getting into the Robinson car. Mr. Robinson is putting Elaine's luggage into the car. Mrs. Robinson stands at the door. Mr. Robinson gets into the car and starts it. The car drives down the driveway and down the street. Ben, dressed differently again, sits in a chair by his desk. He is writing. On the piece of paper is written: DEAR ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, ELAINE, and her name several dozen times. He stops and looks up. It is early morning. We see a swinging door pushed open to reveal: Mr. Braddock, dressed in a bathrobe, standing at the kitchen counter by the window through which we can see an orange tree. Ben stands inside door. Mr. Braddock starts to smile. Ben driving his car. The campus is empty except for Ben who, dressed carefully in his black suit, sits on a bench in the quadrangle outside of Wendell Hall. During which Ben remains static while the quadrangle and the area around him fill up with students; walking, talking, hurrying to class, strolling, sitting, reading, handing out petitions, etc. Elaine comes out. She walks, carrying her books, in Ben's direction. Approaching from the distance. As she walks, she is joined by another GIRL with whom she converses as they walk. Watching. As they approach, they are joined by a tall BOY with a beard. He starts toward them, falters, straightens himself. Mr. McCleery stops and turns. Ben almost runs into him. Mr. McCleery takes a couple of steps up, Ben following and stops again. Mr. McCleery takes a couple more steps and stops again. He looks at Ben searchingly, then turns and continues up the stairs and down the hall. The lady sitting next to Elaine takes a look at her, turns around and looks at Ben, then looks at Elaine again.",
    "421": "He stops for a moment to look at his hands. The casts are off. He knocks on the door with his wrist, as he would if he still had them on. When she opens the door he holds them up boyishly before her face. She kisses his hands. Eddie flexes his fingers, then tries out a shot on one of Johnny's pool tables. He uses the simpler, open hand bridge to support his cue. Bert Gordon enters, and watches him play. Bert smiles at Eddie. It is a quiet, elegant restaurant, one with soft piano music and subdued lighting. Eddie and Sarah had walked past it the first day they met. Eddie and Sarah enter. She has on new dress and Eddie, looking a little ill at ease, has on a suit and tie. The headwaiter seats them at a table. Eddie and Sarah exchange smiles. A waiter approaches. Suddenly she breaks into laughter. The waiter returns with the bottle of sherry and holds it out to Eddie for his approval. There is a long pause as Eddie looks from the bottle to the waiter. Finally, Eddie realizes he must respond. The waiter pours out the sherry as Eddie and Sarah stare at each other over their glasses. Then Eddie looks away. Sarah proposes a toast. They touch glasses. The waiter brings the check. Eddie nods and drinks down the last of his brandy as the waiter leaves. Sarah sees that Eddie seems somber, preoccupied. She picks up her purse and gloves and leaves. It is raining heavily. Sarah emerges from the building and leans wearily against the awning. Eddie, having hurriedly paid the bill, follows after her. He catches up with Sarah, taking her by the arm, and stepping out into the street to hail a cab. She angrily breaks away from him and walks out into the rain. Eddie grabs Sarah and starts to pull her back under the awning. The door opens and the two of them enter, thoroughly drenched. She walks to a chair, limping noticeably. He reaches across and pulls her to him, burying his face in her head. Bert Gordon leans on the hood of a cab. His face drops when he sees Eddie and Sarah walking toward him. Eddie cares two suitcases and his leather cue case. He sets the suitcases on the curb and the cab driver moves to take them. Courteously, Bert opens the door of the taxi for Eddie and Sarah. Sarah eyes Bert distrustfully and starts to get in the cab. Eddie, Sarah, and Bert squeeze through the door of the train compartment. The redcap exits, carrying the luggage. Eddie shuts the door. Bert and Sarah sit across from each other.",
    "423": "Findley spots Bert, takes a long drag on his cigarette, and saunters toward them. Bert points to Eddie. Bert snaps his fingers, pretending to forget Findley's name. He nods to them all, and leaves. Sarah gives Bert a look. The camera tilts upward from a Dixieland combo blaring out a bouncy tune to find Sarah, descending the stairs, looking on at the party below. Holding the rail with one hand, and a champagne glass in the other, she maneuvers her way down the steps. She stops a waitress on the way upstairs and exchanges her glass for a new one. We follow her unsteady, doll-like descent. She moves slowly, dreamily past the combo. She moves past Eddie, who is cornered by a chic blonde in a low-cut dress. She moves past Findley, alone with his drink, observing his guests; past the bleary-eyed couples on the dance floor, until she comes to the bar. Bert is there too, his head bobbing to the Dixie beat, his eyes running over her body so plainly covered by a cotton print dress. Spinning away from him, she takes her glass and goes to a corner of the room. Bert walks casually to her side. He leans over and whispers something in her ear. Her face hardens. Angrily she turns and throws her champagne in his face and smashes her glass on the floor. Then she starts to cry and starts to fall, but Bert holds her up by the shoulders. The music stops. The dance couples strain to get a look at what has happened. Eddie shoves through the gawking crowd. Eddie tries to take her in his arms, but she beats on his chest, sobbing, unable to make words. Eddie drags her limp, trembling body across the dance floor to the stairs. Bert watches them go, wiping the champagne off his coat lapels. The music starts up again. A Negro maid sits patiently in the room, watching over Sarah and the coats that Sarah is lying on. A woman enters and, disgusted, pushes Sarah off her fur coat. Eddie appears in the doorway. The woman takes her coat and leaves. Eddie looks at Sarah for a moment, then turns and walks out. Findley, drink and cork-tipped cigarette in hand, escorts Bert and Eddie down the stairs to his game room. It is a beautifully appointed salon, wood-paneled, filled with plush divans and decorated with terra cotta Roman statuary. In the center of the room is the billiard table, now covered by a cloth. Findley goes to the bar. Eddie eagerly pulls back the cloth that covers the table. But it's not a pool table -- it's a billiard table. Eddie finishes uncovering the table.",
    "428": "In the silence of the room, they bend over their cues and softly stroke out their shots. The balls roll down the table, bank off the far shoulder, and slowly return toward the two players. Fats' ball hits the closer shoulder. The balls are returned and Eddie makes his break shot, a glancing blow that leaves the pack of balls nearly intact and the white cue ball lying far away at the end of the table. Eddie looks up, with a smile. Fats walks around the table and peers at the balls. Placing his cigarette on the wooden rim of the table, Fats rams the cue ball into the pack, dropping the six ball into the pocket. The table is now his. Eddie sits down unhappily. Fats plays quickly, moving from shot to shot with studied authority, his eyes and hands working fluidly together. The shot goes in. As Eddie watches, the prancing, elegant Fats maneuvers around the table. The shot goes in. We see Fats' bejeweled fingers curl around the cue stick, the stick then darting out to send a ball caroming off a far bank and into a side pocket. Fats keeps sinking shots. It is eleven o'clock. Eddie is up. The crowd at Ames sits stolidly in their seats, watching each player, each move. The shot goes in and he lines up another. The shot is a difficult one involving a combination of balls. As it rolls in, the crowd breaks into applause, and Fats bangs the butt of his cue stick on the floor to show his appreciation. So Eddie does the same. Fats peers at the pack of balls huddled together, then points to one that lies in the middle of the pack. Big John looks around -- the shot seems impossible. Fats slams the cue ball into the pack. The balls carom outward in all directions. Only the seven rolls slowly into the corner pocket. Eddie slumps back in his seat as the crowd applauds. It is twelve o'clock, and Fats dominates the play. As he calls out the litany of his shots, we see, superimposed over his hands and his face and the sound of socking pool balls, the spectators, stupefied by the action; Charlie, swallowing hard; Eddie, looking on, waiting to play; and the bills endlessly unfolding out of Charlie's hands and floating onto the table. One-thirty and Fats is still shooting. The shot rolls in. The shot goes in. Fats pounds his stick on the floor. Fats allows a perfunctory bow of his head, a courtly gesture, to Eddie's manager. Charlie looks away, avoiding his eyes. Now it's Eddie's voice we hear calling out the shots. He circles the table, a proud, cocky smile on his face, and superimposed over his movements we see the spectators, hunched up in their chairs, and Fats' face, glowering, hostile.",
    "431": "He looks over at Charlie, asleep in the next bed. He rolls out of bed and goes to the window. We see a neon sign flashing across the street. It reads AMES BILLIARDS. Then Eddie returns to his bed, leaves the keys to the Packard and some money on the night table next to Charlie. He picks up his valise, his hanging bag, and his leather cue case. Eddie goes toward the door. As Eddie enters, carrying his bags, a few early morning travelers -- some soldiers and a man in a Stetson hat -- pass him by. He has been up all night. It is a typical bus station washroom at that time of the morning. The residue of a full day's traveling is in evidence: crumpled paper towels, cigarette butts, etc. Part of the residue is a drunk who sits on the shoeshine seat, fast asleep. Eddie looks at him, shaking his head. A sign on the wall reads IS THIS YOUR LUCKY DAY? Eddie laughs to himself, puts his hanging bag and cue case on a chair, then turns to face his image in the mirror. A wizened old attendant sits nearby. The attendant, whose every move seems to require a tremendous effort, shuffles over and grabs a towel as Eddie removes his jacket. Near the row of coin lockers in the waiting room is a small lunch counter and several tables. At one table, facing the lockers, is a young woman, Sarah: a book is open before her, and a cup of coffee, and an ashtray filled with cigarette butts. She looks up for an instant as Eddie appears. Her eyes return to the printed page. He locks his bags in a locker. He now has on a clean shirt and is clean and freshly shaven. Moving toward the counter, Eddie notices Sarah. He goes to the lunch counter, still looking at her. He sniffs some wrapped sandwiches. Eddie wanders over to a table next to Sarah's and sits down. She ignores him. She returns to her reading. Eddie keeps looking at her. Her hair is brown, cut short, practically straight. Her lips are pale and thin, and the bone structure of her face, although delicate, is much in evidence. There is a suggestion of tired wakefulness, of self-sufficiency, about her. And a frank, open regard which has nothing in it to imply flirtation -- or the lack of it. Sarah goes back to reading. The waitress arrives to take Eddie's order. Eddie holds up two fingers to the waitress, who departs. The coffee comes. Eddie leans back against the wall and shuts his eyes. He slips off to sleep. The waitress brings a check.",
    "437": "Don enters. Only the telephone, which stands on the desk next the open portable, is alive. He seems to be going straight to the ringing telephone, only he isn't. Don's eyes fall on the bottle and the glass by the big chair. He moves slowly towards it, picks up the bottle, holds it upside down over the glass. The living room is in the same wild disorder -- books on the floor, a table on the chair under the ceiling fixture, the couch moved from the wall, clothes and shoes spilled from the closet. Two empty bottles and a sticky glass stand about, and the portable, with its almost virgin sheet of white paper in the roller. Don goes to the glass, holds the two bottles upside down over it. One slow drop is all it yields. Two more meagre drops emerge, like thick syrup. They barely stain the bottom of the glass. Don puts down the two bottles, picks up the glass, empties the pitiable three drops into the parched desert of his throat. What are his finances? Quickly he goes through his pockets. In the palm of his hand there are exactly two cents. He looks around the apartment. There on the desk stands the typewriter. Don walks towards it, rips the sheet of paper from the roller, slams the lid of the cover shut, picks up the typewriter. He drags it to the little hall, picks up his hat and puts it on. There are now two newspapers, two bottles of milk. Don steps over them carefully, closes the door and starts down the stairs. The note from Helen is still pinned to the door. Don comes from the house with the typewriter. A steel gate is drawn across its entrance. Don stares at the obstruction, completely mystified. Don turns to her. There is a woman standing nearby, wheeling a baby in a baby carriage. Don stands helpless for a moment, then, feeling the woman's intrusive stare, straightens up. In the next block, miles and miles away for the way he feels, is another pawn shop. He starts for it. Again every step is agony. Overhead the elevated thunders excruciatingly. He makes a pillar of the el, leans against it, shaking. When a trolley car gets out of his way, he continues to cross the street. At last he makes the second pawn shop. That pawn shop is closed too. It too is closed. Don takes a bar and shakes it. He peers through the iron gate into the dark shop, turns around. Across the street, in the same block, is the third pawn shop. Sweat pours from his forehead. The two men stand grinning. He picks up the typewriter, turns and starts walking back.",
    "439": "They wear terry-cloth bathrobes over their pajamas, canvas slippers on their feet. In the listless, burned-out collection, Don is the only person who moves with purpose. There are canvas slippers on his feet. Sitting on them and milling aimlessly around, are some thirty alcoholics. It is L-shaped, about fourteen feet wide. He goes around the bend of the ell and there is the door, a heavy wooden one with a grated peep-hole and beside it a uniformed guard. Don goes to the door, tries to open it. At this moment the door is opened by another male nurse, carrying a pile of clean sheets and pillow cases. Don tries to take advantage of the opening of the door to get out, but the guard pulls him by the arm, while the entering nurse locks the door with his own key. Don turns, At the bend of the corridor stands Bim, with a tumbler of medicine in his hand. Don approaches him slowly. He points at a man in a wheel-chair. Bim seats Don on his bed. He points to the man with the sensitive face, who stands against the wall. It is lighted by a faint blue light, but the lights are on in the anteroom and some light comes through the glass doors. On his cot lies Don, his eyes wide open. Don pivots in the direction of the sound. On a cot in the corner is the man with the sensitive face and the addiction to beetles. He is slapping wildly at his bed, moaning. He rises and begins to slap the wall and scream. Don stares at him through the dimness. Through the glass doors come two male nurses with flashlights. They run to the cot of the D.T. victim. There is a wild scrabble as he fights them off. One of the nurses races back to the door and calls. A third nurse races in, throws a straitjacket to the first nurse, hurries to one of the other beds. Seen through the glass doors, a doctor comes running down the ante-room, followed by another male nurse with a cart on which are hypodermic syringes, etc. He enters the ward and dashes in the direction of the beetle patient. The doctor must have been in another building, because over his shoulders is flung a dark blue overcoat. As he goes, he tosses the overcoat on the empty cot next Don. Don looks after the doctor, then is fascinated by the coat lying beside him. In the corner the three nurses and the doctor are working over the beetle patient, the doctor giving him a hypo, the nurses getting him into the straitjacket. He looks at Don. As his gaze reaches Don's pajama trousers and canvas slippers.",
    "441": "Don's eyes turn slowly toward the door. Helen stands outside, ringing the bell. She bangs on the door, rattling the doorknob helplessly. Still no answer and she raps on the door. He sits staring at the door, holding his breath not to betray his presence. Don sits bathed in sweat, tears of terror in his eyes, staring at the door. She turns and runs down the stairs. Mrs. Deveridge stands in her door, peering up. She hurries to the stairwell and calls down it. His eyes are on the door. Now they focus ON THE DOOR CHAIN. Don realizes he's forgotten to put it up, but it's not too late, is it? With a desperate effort he flings himself to the floor and starts inching his way to the door. Don is almost at the door. With his last strength Don raises himself against the door, stretches out his hand, gets the door chain, tries to slip it in its notch, but misses. Dave, the janitor, a ring with labelled keys on it in his hand, leads Helen and Mrs. Deveridge up the stairs. Dave has opened the door and holds it open as far as he can. Don tries again, but by this time the door is open. Don throws all his weight against the door but it is no use. Helen slips into Dave's place in the doorway. She stands waiting until Dave and Mrs. Deveridge start downstairs. Helen enters, closing the door behind her. A shaft of light comes from the corridor. Don crouches behind the door. She kneels down beside Don. They are beside the light switch. Helen snaps it on. She leads Don toward it. He stares at the smooth, unstained wall. She seats him on the bed. She turns on the bed lamp. Don is panting hard, completely oblivious of the fact that Helen is in the room. On the armchair near the kitchen door lies Helen's leopard coat. Helen lies asleep on the couch, using the pillow and the comforter from Wick's bed. In the door to the bedroom stands Don. He wears the dark suit (the one he wore to the opera) and as his eyes shift from Helen to the coat, he is just tying his tie. Very cautiously he begins to tiptoe toward the chair. He picks up the leopard coat and starts towards the entrance door. Just as he is slipping out, comes. Don shuts the door behind him. She flings open the door and runs out. In the next second Helen hurries into the shot. She is wearing Wick's foulard dressing gown. Helen runs to the banister and looks down. She is barefooted, just wearing the foulard dressing gown.",
    "443": "Helen and Wick watch Don. Don's face relaxes into an innocent grin. His eyes meet Helen's. Hers are infinitely distressed. Wick has twisted the string off the bottle. Wick, the bottle in his hand, goes through the living room toward the kitchenette. Don looks after him, then follows him, a stubborn smile on his lips. Wick has stepped to the sink. He opens the bottle, turns it upside down and lets the whiskey run out. Helen trails after them, acutely embarrassed. Don and Helen come to the door from the living room and stand watching. Don has something of the feeling of a man watching the execution of a very good friend, but he senses Helen's eyes upon him and preserves his nonchalant expression. The bottle emptied, Wick puts it in the sink. Wick shrugs and goes to the hall for his hat. She kisses him on the mouth, a woman hopelessly in love. She turns to go, but Don holds her back. Then, so that he won't see her moist eyes, she turns and hurries into the entrance hall. Wick turns toward Don, who has followed Helen to the entrance hall. Helen comes out quickly and taking a handkerchief from her bag, hurries past Wick into the hall. Wick stands, hat in hand, holding the door open. He goes out, shutting the door behind him. Don steps quickly to the door, presses his ear against it to hear what the two are saying outside. It is narrow and simple. Every so often down the stair there is a light bracket, always burning. A skylight, somewhat obscured by dirt and dust, lights the fourth floor back. They descend a few steps. Wick takes her arm quickly. They go on down the stairs. Don stands at the door, panic in his face. Has his brother discovered the other two bottles? He puts the chain on the door to insure his privacy, then dashes into the bathroom. Don dashes in, takes a nail file, kneels beside the grille of a register in the side wall, pries it out with the file, looks inside, puts his hand in. He looks at the hole wide-eyed, pushes back the grille and runs out. Don comes running in, goes to the couch, pulls it away from the wall, throws himself on his belly on the couch and reaches under the side of it which was towards the wall. His hand explores among the springs. He sits up. His face is covered with sweat. He takes out his handkerchief and wipes his face. Just then, from the direction of the entrance door, there is the noise of a key being turned in the lock. It opens as far as the chain will allow, stops with a sharp bite of metal on wood.",
    "448": "Don Birnam, in a light summer suit, paces up and down the lobby. He keeps eyeing the doors to the elevators. Under his arm is a florist's box. He walks toward one of those circular plush settees common to hotels, sits down, puts the flower box next to him and adjusts the knot of his tie, his eye still on the elevator doors. On the other side of the settee are a middle-aged couple. Don can't see them, they can't see him, as he overhears their conversation, and it takes him a little time to realize that they are Helen's parents. MR. ST. JAMES is wearing a linen suit and a good but yellowing panama hat, the brim turned up. MRS. ST. JAMES is a cheerful little woman with glasses pinned to her dress, the kind that pull. He leans his head against the back of the settee, acutely uncomfortable. Mr. St. James is fuming a little. Mrs. St. James laughs comfortably. He picks up the florist's box, rises and moves away from the settee. When he has reached the security of some potted palms, he looks back. Through one of the revolving doors comes Helen, in a new spring suit. She looks around, sees her parents, goes up to them. There is a greeting, some conversation apparently about Don and the fact that he'll get there any minute. Don stands undecided, then looks around, locates the public telephone booths, steps into one of them. Don deposits a nickel and dials the number of the Hotel Manhattan, which is above the mouthpiece of the phone. He holds the phone and looks through the glass door of the telephone booth. Helen rises and follows him over to the line of house phones on a shelf. She picks up the phone, speaks. Helen has hung up too. She goes towards her parents, her face a little crestfallen. As she joins them she evidently starts to explain. Don emerges with the florist's box, careful not to be seen. He leaves through one of the side doors. In the dim foreground stands a small table, beyond it the vague contours of Don lying on the couch. A key is turned in the lock, and Wick enters. On the floor beside him an empty bottle, in his hand a half-filled glass. He switches on the light in the little entrance hall, flips his hat jauntily to a hook on the coat-rack and comes into the living room. As he crosses the threshold he becomes aware of Don's presence. Don puts his arm over his face. He wears a hat and carries a brief-case. Wick throws the briefcase into a chair. Wick snaps off the light.",
    "449": "From now on the scene plays in dimness, save for the shaft of light from the entrance hall. Wick goes and sits beside Don, takes the glass from his hand. Wick has bent over Don and loosened his tie. Paying no attention to the sound of steps which has been coming from the staircase, Wick rises, puts the glass of whiskey on the table and is about to cross towards the telephone when the doorbell rings -- short, short, long, short. Wick freezes. Don sits up on the couch. Don, clinging to Wick's arm, pulls himself up. Wick pushes him through the doorway to the dark bedroom, closing the door after him. He snaps on the lights in the living room, rolls the empty bottle under the couch, takes the glass of whiskey, puts it behind the pile of records. As he is starting towards the door, the bottle rolls from under the couch. From under the couch has rolled the bottle. Wick stops and rolls it back again, then goes into the hall and opens the door. As Helen speaks, he tries to get near it without her noticing. Suddenly she sees Wick trying to kick the bottle back under the couch. He walks over to the records and picks up the glass. He stands with his head against the door post, listening, harassed. Helen comes into the living room. He takes a drink. Wick stands, the glass of whiskey in his hand, startled taut at the sight of Don who comes in, not too steady on his feet. Almost at the door to the entrance hall, Helen turns back. Helen comes back into the room, staring at Don. She is beginning to realize that he's drunk. Don looks at the glass in Wick's hand. He takes the glass out of Wick's hand. He opens the drawer, takes out two bullets, holds them in the palm of his hand. Helen looks at him for a second, then takes off her hat and throws it into a nearby chair. Wick goes into the kitchenette. She raises herself to her tiptoes and kisses him warmly. Nat and Don alone. Nat is behind the bar, putting tooth-picks into olives which he takes from a bowl and arranges in a row on a plate. Don jumps up. He jumps up, runs back to the bookcase, starts pulling out books, row by row. He goes to the closet, opens it wide, pulls out all its contents, throwing them on the floor. He goes back to the big chair, throws himself down, exhausted. His eyes fall again on the empty bottle and the empty glass. Something is written on it but it is distorted by the glass.",
    "452": "He examines where the flames burst over her. Westley grabbing Buttercup, pulling her aside to safety as another great spun of flame suddenly shoots up. Buttercup is frozen with fear. He takes her hand, gently leads her forward as we. The two of them moving slowly along through a particularly dangerous part of the Fire Swamp. It's later now, the sun slants down at a slightly different angle. Westley simply picks up Buttercup as they walk along, moves her out of danger, puts her back down, goes right on talking without missing a beat. Westley takes his sword, slices a path for them to follow. The vines groan as they fall. He's been chatting away the entire time. Westley picks her up, carrying her across some swamp water that is bridged by a narrow, rickety tree branch. The two of them have by now crossed the pond. Buttercup, perplexed, is about to reply but the ground she steps on gives way--it's Lightning Sand--a great patch of it, and it has her--a cloud of powder rises and she sinks into the stuff crying Westley's name but then she is gone as we. Westley whirling, slashing at a U-shaped vine, hacks it in half--it's still connected to the tree. Then he grabs it, drops his sword, and, clutching the other end of the vine, he dives into the lightning sand and there is another cloud of white powder, but it settles quickly. Now nothing can be seen. Just the lightning sand, lovely and lethal. And then a giant R.O.U.S. darts into view. The R.O.U.S.--a Rodent of Unusual Size--is probably no more than eighty pounds of bone and power. It sniffs around a bit then, as quickly as it has come, it goes. The lightning sand, as Westley, lungs long past the bursting point, explodes out; he has Buttercup across his shoulders and as he pulls to the edge of the lightning sand pit, using the vine. Her face is caked with the white powder. It is in her eyes, her ears, hair, mouth. She's still probably beautiful, but you have to look awfully hard to see it. As Westley continues to pull them to safety. The R.O.U.S., high above them; it watches. Buttercup, placed against a tree. Westley is cleaning the lightning sand from her face. The R.O.U.S on a much lower branch now. It stares down at Westley. Westley stares back up at the beast. Her eyes flutter. He continues to work on her as. Now there are two R.O.U.S.'s. They have climbed into a nearby tree, stare hungrily down. Westley, picking her up. He puts an arm around her, starts to walk with her as he encouragingly goes on talking.",
    "453": "And as he says that, a R.O.U.S comes flying at him from off-screen. The thing's teeth sink deep into his arm. Westley drives a fist into the beast's face, rolling it off. He reaches for his sword just a few feet away, but the R.O.U.S is back atop him. It's a fierce battle, and just when we think Westley can't possibly win, he flips the ugly rodent clear. Westley scrambles for his sword. The R.O.U.S. stampedes on, changing its target, heading right for-- Buttercup, and she's scared to death and. And from somewhere they summon strength, pick up their pace, and as they reach the edge of the Fire Swamp. Something we hadn't expected: Humperdinck on his horse, Rugen beside him. THREE WARRIORS, armed and ready, are mounted in formation behind. They stop. Buttercup looks beyond exhaustion. Westley looks worse. Behind Humperdinck are the waters of the bay. WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, staring out at the others. BUTTERCUP, looking from one to the other; then something else catches her eye and we. AN ARMED WARRIOR, in shadow, with a loaded crossbow aimed at Westley's heart. BUTTERCUP, looking the other way. ANOTHER WARRIOR, crossbow aimed at Westley. BUTTERCUP, frantically staring around, and now. A THIRD WARRIOR, crossbow stretched, ready to shoot; this one is hidden in a tree blocking any escape Westley might try. HUMPERDINCK, whirling to face her. WESTLEY, whirling to face her. BUTTERCUP, talking to them both. BUTTERCUP AND WESTLEY, staring deep into each other's eyes. Westley is dazed. Buttercup tries to speak again, can't, and is swooped off her feet onto Humperdinck's horse, and off they go. WESTLEY, staring after her. Rugen watches as his warriors bring Westley to him. The Count has a heavy sword and he holds it in his hand. Westley is looking at him. Count Rugen clubs Westley hard across the skull. Westley starts to fall--the screen goes black. Dank and chill, underground and windowless, lit by flickering torches. Frightening. Westley lies in the center of the cage, chained and helpless. Dead pale, he silently enters the pit, carrying a tray of food and medication. He puts it down. He begins tending Westley's wounds. Westley winces. From the Albino: a nod. From the Albino: a shake of the head. He studies Westley, whose face is almost sad. BUTTERCUP, and her face is sad. Pallid, perhaps ill. She wanders down a corridor in Florin Castle. As she moves unseeing past an intersecting corridor. PRINCE HUMPERDINCK AND COUNT RUGEN, watching her. As they move on. CAMERA HOLDS ON IT while we hear the Grandfather's voice reading. And if we thought it was packed before, we didn't know how many more could fit in this courtyard. Humperdinck, Rugen and the Queen stand high on the balcony.",
    "455": "The Assistant Brute takes the full force of the blow right in the chops. TWO LARGE TUBS, one filled with steaming water, the other with water clearly of an icy nature. Without a word FEZZIK stuffs Inigo's head into the icy water, then, after a reasonable amount of time, pulls him out, ducks him into the steaming stuff, and, a short time after that, puts him back in the cold again, then back in the hot. Then a wild look hits Inigo. Yellin enters, and kneels. He shows the key, dangling from a chain around his neck. Just at that moment, Buttercup enters. The Prince looks at her blankly for a moment. BUTTERCUP, staring at Humperdinck. And with that he whirls, turns on The Machine, grabs the lever and, calling out. PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, shoving the lever all the way up and, And there has never been such pain. A few CHILDREN pale, bolt toward their PARENTS and, The Albino appears wheeling a barrow. INIGO'S SWORD pushes at his chest. The Albino shakes his head, says nothing. And FEZZIK crunches the Albino on the top of the head as if he had a hammer and was driving in a nail. The Albino drops without a sound. He kneels, the sword held tight between his hands. Eyes closed, he faces the grove of trees, starts to talk, his voice low and strange. And now he rises, eyes still closed. as Inigo, eyes shut tight, walks forward, the great sword held in his hands. FEZZIK, frightened, follows close behind. walking blind through the grove of trees. He moves to the Secret Knot, hesitates, then moves past it. Then Inigo stops. For a long moment he stands frozen. Suddenly he whirls, eyes still closed, and the sword strikes home dead center into a knot and-- Nothing. He has failed. In utter despair he collapses against the tree. Against a knot in the tree. Against THE KNOT in the tree. It slides away, revealing the staircase. FEZZIK and Inigo look at each other, then start down. WESTLEY, dead by The Machine. FEZZIK leans over him, listening for a heartbeat. Then he looks at Inigo, shakes his head. For a moment, he just sags. He is terribly excited and looks stronger than we've yet seen him. And he desperately fights for control. Inigo, in despair. (We're back in the Pit, the same shot as before). For a moment, he just sags. Inigo, FEZZIK, Westley approach the door. They knock. If Mel Brooks' 2000 Year Old Man was really old, he'd resemble this guy. Inigo pounds again. He shuts the window. They rap on the door. INIGO AND FEZZIK, hurrying inside. FEZZIK carries Westley who is just starting to stiffen up a little.",
    "456": "He lays Westley down across a bench by the fireplace, picks Westley's arm up and lets it drop limp. He studies Westley a moment, checking here, checking there. He goes to get a huge bellows. Inigo does. Max inserts the bellows in Westley's mouth and starts to pump. He stops pumping. And he presses lightly on Westley's chest. And as Valerie shrieks excitedly we. It is somewhat smaller than a tennis ball. PULL BACK TO REVEAL MAX AND VALERIE, exhausted, looking at the lump with beautific pleasure, as Valerie, cooking utensil in hand, covers the thing with what looks like chocolate. Inigo and FEZZIK stare at the thing too, but more dubiously. Inigo accepts the pill as FEZZIK takes Westley, who is stiff as a board now. During this, FEZZIK, using all his strength, has managed to get Westley into a right angled sitting position, while Inigo brings out the miracle pill. Pill in hand, he drops it into Westley's mouth. Inigo and FEZZIK react. Westley is the only one not amazed. He sits there, immobile, like a ventriloquist's dummy. He is watching his fingers, one of which twitches now. FEZZIK helps Inigo raise Westley just high enough so he can see for himself. WESTLEY, absolutely stunned. He shakes his head from side to side. Inigo and FEZZIK do. They move along the wall in silence for a time. Then these words come to us on the wind. BUTTERCUP, in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. BUTTERCUP, and she couldn't seem more serene. WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK, looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake hands. Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing clergyman imaginable. Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door. He has an impediment that would stop a clock. THE BRUTES AND YELLIN, by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. And it is a bit unnerving--a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. YELLIN, keeping the Brutes in position, or trying to, shouting orders, instructions and as yet the Brutes hold.",
    "457": "Inigo struggles bravely under their combined weight. The Brutes, as the Giant bursts suddenly, happily into flames. The Chapel, where The Impressive Clergyman plows on. Fezzik, as he pulls off the holocaust cloak. And Fezzik rushes forward, grabbing the portcullis, which is indeed closing quickly. Fezzik grabs the gate: and swings the tonnage back upward. Yellin just watches in fear. Buttercup only smiles, shakes her head. And she's right. It's there. Yellin, pressed against the main gate. Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik close in. And he whips it out, hands it to Fezzik. Buttercup, standing there. Dazed. Count Rugen and his four warriors, racing through the castle, and as they reach a complex intersection of several corridors, Rugen stops, incredulous, as we. Westley, Inigo, and Fezzik, moving toward them. Actually Fezzik is dragging Westley, who is, in turn, dragging Yellin's sword like a stiff dog leash--Westley simply hasn't the strength to raise it. Count Rugen, as the confrontation is about to start. And as his Warriors attack-- Inigo goes wild, and maybe the Warrior's are good, maybe they're even better than that--but they never get a chance to show it because this is something now, this is Inigo gone mad and the six-fingered sword has never flashed faster and the fourth warrior is dead before the first one has even hit the floor. For a moment he just stands there, sword in hand. Then he does a most unexpected thing. He turns and runs the hell away. Inigo, momentarily surprised, then taking off after him, leaving Westley and Fezzik to exchange curious looks and Rugen, running through a half-open heavy wooden door, shutting it and locking it just as Inigo throws himself against it. He tries again. Fezzik with Westley, who is still unable to walk under his own power. He calls back. Inigo, desperately pounding at the heavy door. And he props Westley up against a large suit of armour and takes off toward the intersection where Inigo's voice came from. Inigo, still hammering the door. Fezzik approaches, gestures for him to stop, and with one mighty swipe of his mighty hands the door crumbles. And Inigo flies through as Fezzik heads back to Westley. The Queen, more sprightly, is several paces ahead. Buttercup gently stops the King and places a kiss on his forehead. He's very surprised and pleased. And on those words. And he's running, dashing through corridors and as he glances back. Inigo, behind him, coming like a streak and. The Intersection, with the large suit of armour, and Fezzik gaping, staring at all those choices, trying to piece together the puzzle of the missing Westley. Count Rugen, flashing out of one room, down a staircase, picking up his pace.",
    "459": "INIGO, pushing slowly off from the wall again. And again he attacks, slashing with wondrous skill. But none of his blows get through and, slowly, Inigo, again moves forward. COUNT RUGEN, retreating more quickly around the table. Inigo drives for the Count's left shoulder now, thrusts home where the Count had gotten him. Then another move and his blade enters the Count's right shoulder, the same spot Inigo was wounded. And now the six-fingered sword strikes and there is a slash bleeding along one of Rugen's cheeks. The great sword flashes again, and now there is a parallel slash bleeding on Rugen's other cheek. And on that. INIGO, and almost too fast for the eye to follow, the sword strikes one final time and. COUNT RUGEN, crying out in fear and panic as the sword hits home dead center and. INIGO AND RUGEN, the sword clear through the Count. They are almost frozen like that for a moment. Then Inigo withdraws his sword and as the Count pitches down. RUGEN, lying dead. His skin is ashen and the blood still pours from the parallel cuts on his cheeks and his eyes are bulging wide, full of fear. INIGO, staring at Rugen. WESTLEY lies as before, not a muscle has moved, his head is still on the headboard, Yellin's sword at his side. Buttercup is alongside the bed; her eyes never leave his face. HUMPERDINCK, entering the room, staring at them. He pulls out his sword. WESTLEY, lying there comfortably, his words quiet at first. gripping his sword, watching. And now he stops, and the look that was in his eyes at the wedding, that look of fear, is starting to return. HUMPERDINCK, doing his best to hide the fear that keeps building inside him. WESTLEY, lying there, staring at him. And now, slowly, Westley begins to move. His body turns, his feet go to the floor, he starts to stand. HUMPERDINCK, staring, eyes wide. And now he is standing, sword in fighting position. PRINCE HUMPERDINCK, and he's so panicked he doesn't know whether to pee or wind his watch. He throws his sword to the floor. WESTLEY, speaking to Buttercup as Humperdinck sits. And as she sets to work. INIGO, entering, looking around. HUMPERDINCK, and now be starts wrestling mightily with his bonds. They look at each other, then move to the balcony, and. FEZZIK, leading FOUR GREAT WHITE HORSES. He glances up, sees them on the balcony. INIGO AND WESTLEY AND BUTTERCUP, looking down at FEZZIK. And as he holds out his great arms. Buttercup floating through the air. What's happening, of course, is that she's jumping from the balcony so FEZZIK can catch her. But her fall is in slow motion so you might think she was flying.",
    "460": "Great waves of people kneeling. Buttercup, terribly moved. She stands immobile among her subjects, blinking back tears. Hold on her beauty for a moment. Buttercup, barreling along, controlling her horse easily. Lovely, quiet, deserted. Buttercup suddenly reins in. Three men, standing close together in the path. Beyond them can be seen the waters of Florin Channel. The three men are not your everyday commuter types. Standing in front is a tiny man with the most angelic face. He is Sicilian and his name is Vizzini. Beside him is a Spaniard, erect and taut as a blade of steel. Beside him is a giant. As she starts to fall. A sailboat is moored. It's dusk now, shadows are long. Inigo, the Spaniard, busies himself getting the boat ready. The giant Fezzik carries Buttercup, unconscious, on board. Vizzini rips some tiny pieces of fabric from an army jacket and tucks them along the saddle of Buttercup's horse. There is about the entire operation a sense of tremendous skill and precision. The horse takes off. They start for the boat. Vizzini hops onto the boat. Vizzini, in a fury. Inigo and Fezzik, as Vizzini advances on them. Vizzini glares at him, then turns, leaves them. During this, Inigo has gone close to Fezzik, who is very distressed at the insults he's just received. As they sail off, we hear their voices as the boat recedes. Inigo is at the helm, Fezzik stands near the body of the princess, whose eyelids flutter slightly--or do they? Vizzini sits motionless. The waves are higher, there are only occasional flashes of moon slanting down between clouds. Inigo nods, glances back. Vizzini turns a cold eye on the Princess. Inigo keeps staring behind them. And suddenly the three whirl, stare back and as they do. It's hard to see; the moon is behind clouds now. But the wind whistles. And the waves pound. And suddenly it's all gone ominous. Inigo, Fezzik, and Vizzini squinting back, trying desperately to see. At this moment, they are all holding their breaths. Then-- The moon slips through and-- Inigo was right--something is very much there. A sailboat. It's a good distance behind them, but it's coming like hell, closing the gap. Staring at the other boat. Buttercup, diving into the water, starting to swim away. The boat, and Vizzini screaming. Buttercup, still close to the boat, switching from a crawl to a silent breast stroke. The wind dies and as it does, something new is heard. Buttercup stops suddenly, treads water. Buttercup, treading water, still not far from the boat. Buttercup stays silent. Buttercup, and she's a gutsy girl. Behind her now, something dark and gigantic slithers past. She's scared, sure, petrified, who wouldn't be, but she makes no reply-- and now a shrieking eel has zeroed in on her-- and now she sees it, a short distance away, circling, starting to close-- and Buttercup is frozen, trying not to make a movement of any kind-- and the eel slithers closer, closer-- and Buttercup knows it now, there's nothing she can do, it's over, all over-- and now the eel opens its mouth wide, and it's never made such a noise, and as its great jaws are about to clamp down.",
    "463": "The Man In Black sits to rest on the boulder that once held the rope. He tugs off his leather boots and is amazed to see several large rocks tumble out. The Man In Black wears gloves. Inigo stares at them. He glances up--the question clearly baffles him. He hands his sword to the Man In Black. Even now, this still brings pain. The Man In Black looks up at Inigo. And on that word. And what we are starting now is one of the two greatest sword fights in modern movies (the other one happens later on), and right from the beginning it looks different. The six-fingered sword, feinting here, feinting there. The two men, finished teasing, begin to duel in earnest. Their swords cross, then again, again, and the sound comes so fast it's almost continual. Inigo presses on, the Man In Black retreating up a rocky incline. And he shifts his style now. The Man In Black is now perched at the edge of the elevated castle ruin. Inigo stares down at him. And now, with the grace of an Olympian, Inigo flies off the perch, somersaults clean over the Man In Black's head, and lands facing his opponent. The two men are almost flying across the rocky terrain, never losing balance, never coming close to stumbling; the battle rages with incredible finesse, first one and then the other gaining the advantage, and by now, it's clear that this isn't just two athletes going at it, it's a lot more that that. And behind him now, drawing closer all the time, is the deadly edge of the Cliffs of Insanity. Inigo fights and ducks and feints and slashes and it all works, but not for long, as gradually the Man In Black keeps the advantage, keeps forcing Inigo back, closer and closer to death. The Cliff edge is very close now. Inigo is continually being forced toward it. Inches from defeat, Inigo is, in fact, all smiles. And he throws the six-fingered sword into his right hand and immediately, the tide of battle turns. The Man In Black, stunned, doing everything he can to keep Inigo by the Cliff edge. But no use. Slowly at first, he begins to retreat. Now faster, Inigo is in control and the Man In Black is desperate. And the six-fingered sword is all but invisible now, as he increases his attack, then suddenly switches styles again. A rocky staircase leading to a turret-shaped plateau, and the Man In Black is retreating like mad up the steps and he can't stop Inigo--nothing can stop Inigo--and in a frenzy, the Man In Black makes every feint, tries every thrust, lets go with all he has left.",
    "464": "Inigo tries one style, another, but it all comes down to the same thing--the Man In Black seems to be in control. And to his amazement, he is being forced back down the steps. He tries one or two final desperate moves but they are nothing. And before Inigo knows it, the six-fingered sword is knocked clear out of his hand. Inigo retreats, dives from the stairs to a moss-covered bar suspended over the archway. He swings out, lands, and scrambles to his sword and we. Then the Man In Black copies INIGO. He dives to the bar, swings completely over it like a circus performer and dismounts with a 9.7 backflip. INIGO, staring in awe. And now he changes hands, and at last, the battle is fully joined. And now the Man In Black is smashed into a stone pillar, pinned there under the six fingered sword. He dunks Inigo's head with his heavy sword handle. Inigo pitches forward unconscious. He grabs his scabbard and takes off after the Princess and we. Vizzini, staring down from a narrow mountain path, as far below the Man In Black can be seen running. It's a little later in the morning. FEZZIK, carrying the Princess, stands alongside. Vizzini points to them. There is a large boulder nearby. As Vizzini and Buttercup hurry away. He grabs one of the rocks and plods behind the boulder and we. THE MAN IN BLACK, racing up the mountain trail. Ahead is a bend in the trail. He sees it, slows. Then he stops, listening. Satisfied by the silence, he starts forward again and as he rounds the bend--a rock flies INTO FRAME, shattering on a boulder inches in front of him. He moves into the mountain path. He has picked up another rock and holds it lightly. He gets set to throw, but the Man In Black shakes his head, takes off his sword and scabbard, begins the approach toward the Giant. He flips the rock away. The Man In Black is not now and has never been a shrimp. But it's like he wasn't even there, FEZZIK towers over him so much. There is a moment's pause, and then the Man In Black dives at FEZZIK's chest, slams him several tremendous blows in the stomach, twists his arm severely, slips skillfully into a beautifully applied bear hug, and in general makes any number of terrific wrestling moves. FEZZIK just stands there, kind of taking in the scenery. Finally the Man In Black pushes himself away, stares up at the Giant. They get set to begin again. Everything fails. But he fails.",
    "466": "A knife pointed at a throat--PULL BACK TO REVEAL Vizzini munching on an apple, holding the knife to Buttercup's throat. She is blindfolded. A PICNIC SPREAD is laid out. A tablecloth, two goblets and between them, a small leather wine container. And some cheese and a couple of apples. The picnic is set on a lovely spot, high on the edge of a mountain path with a view all the way back to the sea. The Man In Black comes running around the path, sees Vizzini, slows. The two men study each other. The Man In Black nods and comes nearer. And he pushes his long knife harder against Buttercup's unprotected throat. BUTTERCUP'S THROAT, as Vizzini jabs with his long knife. Buttercup gasps against the pain. THE MAN IN BLACK, stopping fast. The Man In Black nods. Another nod. As Vizzini fills the goblets with the dark red liquid, the Man In Black pulls a small packet from his clothing, handing it to Vizzini. He studies the Man In Black now. As Vizzini's pleasure has been growing throughout, the Man In Black's has been fast disappearing. And suddenly he stops, points at something behind the Man In Black. THE MAN IN BLACK, turning around, looking. VIZZINI, busily switching the goblets while the Man In Black has his head turned. The Man In Black turns to face him again. Vizzini starts to laugh. And he picks up his goblet. The Man In Black picks up the one in front of him. As they both start to drink, Vizzini hesitates a moment. Then, allowing the Man In Black to drink first, he swallows his wine. There's nothing he can say. He just sits there. VIZZINI, watching him. He laughs and roars and cackles and whoops and is in all ways quite cheery until he falls over dead. THE MAN IN BLACK, stepping past the corpse, taking the blindfold and bindings off Buttercup, who notices Vizzini lying dead. The Man In Black pulls her to her feet. He starts to lead her off the mountain path into untraveled terrain. It's where FEZZIK fought the Man in Black. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince, kneeling, inspecting every grain of misplaced sand. The others wait behind him. He leaps onto his horse and they charge off. The Man In Black comes running into view, still dragging Buttercup, who sometimes stumbles, but he keeps forcing her along. Finally, when she is close to exhaustion, he lets go of her. And the Man In Black cocks back a fist. Buttercup flinches, but does not retreat. The picnic is spread as before. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the Prince kneeling by the body as the others ride up.",
    "467": "The Prince grabs the empty poison packet, hands it to Rugen, after first sniffing it himself. And as he vaults onto his horse and they all charge off. BUTTERCUP, being spun INTO CAMERA view, falling heavily as the Man In Black releases her. We are at the edge of an almost sheer ravine. The drop is sharp and severe. Below, the ravine floor is flat, but getting there would not be half the fun. The Man In Black says nothing. CLOSE UP - BUTTERCUP, quietly now. watching her closely. And probably, if she did not hate Roberts so, there would be tears. Buttercup nods. The Man In Black is about to reply as they stand there on the edge of the sheer ravine. But then something catches his attention and as he stares at it briefly. The dust cloud caused by Humperdinck's HORSES is rising up into the sky. BUTTERCUP, and while his attention is on the dust cloud, rising high, she pushes him with all the strength she has. THE MAN IN BLACK, teetering on the ravine edge, for a moment, then he begins to fall. Down goes the Man In Black. Down, down, rolling, spinning, crashing always down toward the flat rock floor of the ravine. BUTTERCUP, staring transfixed at what she has wrought. She stands there, alone, as from far below the words come to her, drifting on the wind. And without a second thought or consideration of the dangers, she starts into the ravine. A moment later, she too is falling, spinning and twisting, crashing and torn, cartwheeling down toward what is left of her beloved. THE DUST CLOUD, rising. Prince Humperdinck and the others reining in at the spot where Buttercup promised ransom in exchange for her freedom. The mere mention of the Fire Swamp makes him pale. TWO BODIES lie a few feet apart, not moving. After a time, Westley slowly forces his body into motion and as he does. BUTTERCUP, bruised and torn, as Westley crawls slowly toward her. And now, they begin to kiss; it's a tender kiss, tender and loving and gentle and. racing along the ravine floor. Westley glances up. perched on top of the cliff, looking down at Westley and Buttercup. And it really doesn't look any worse than any other moist, sulphurous, infernal horror you might run across. Great trees block the sun. Buttercup is clearly panicked and maybe Westley is too, but he moves jauntily along, sword in hand. THE GIANT TREES, thick and black-green, look ominous as hell and they shield all but intermittent stripes of sun. WESTLEY, instantly forcing Buttercup to sit, gathering her flaming hem in his hands, doing his best to suffocate the fire.",
    "470": "The room, lit by a few candles, appears dirty. The camera shows us again Leopold's portrait on the wall, looking down upon a scene of disorder. Papers litter the table; dirty dishes are piled in the fireplace; on the forte-piano lies Mozart's Masonic apron, woven with symbols. We watch him stand beside Constanze, who lies asleep. Mozart now looks very ill; his wife appears worn out. Then he moves to the cot where his son Karl lies asleep and kneels, pulls up the child's little blanket and for a moment lays his own head down beside the boy's. Constanze opens her eyes and stares at him. Mozart rises and returns to. Instantly Mozart starts to dance to it, all alone: gleefully, like a child. He looks up at his father's portrait, and makes a silly, rude gesture at it. He is, briefly, an irresponsible and happy boy again. Then suddenly there is a gentle knocking at the door. The music fades down. Warily, Mozart crosses and opens the door. Before him stands the masked stranger. He turns and looks. Constanze has come into the living room. Nervously, Mozart indicates her. Salieri contemplates them both. He turns and goes down the stairs. Mozart shuts the door. He closes his eyes in fear. He will not look at her or reply. He looks at her suddenly. Her tears flow. Mozart looks at her helplessly. And with a scream Madame Weber's voice turns into the shrill packing coloratura of the second act aria of the Queen of the Night, in The Magic Flute. On stage we see the QUEEN OF THE NIGHT fantastically costumed, furiously urging her daughter to kill Sarastro. As she sings, we see the interior of the theatre, now re-arranged from when we last visited it to watch the Cabaret. An audience of ordinary German citizens stands in the pit area, or sits: they are rapt and excited. The theatre also possesses boxes; some of these show closed curtains - their inhabitants presumably engaged in private intimacies. In one of them sits Salieri. He struggles to loosen his cravat. Salieri moves to the door. Salieri leaves the room. Salieri goes to the front door and opens it to reveal Schikaneder, who has obviously come straight from the theatre. He still wears his bird make-up and under his street cloak, his feathered costume is clearly seen. He has with him the three actresses, also looking anxious and also in make-up as the three attendants in The Magic Flute. Salieri pours the coins out of the bag onto the coverlet. Mozart looks at the coins astonished. He takes his pen. Salieri writes the key signature. He again hums the bass vocal line from the beginning, conducting.",
    "475": "Constanze curtsies. He giggles uncomfortably. Cavalieri is glaring at Mozart. Mozart looks hastily away from her. She attempts to kiss the royal hand, but faints instead. The Emperor contemplates her prone body and steps back a pace. He nods pleasantly to all and leaves the stage, with his Chamberlain. Cavalieri turns with a savage look at Mozart and leaves the stage the opposite way, to her dressing room, tossing her plumed head. Salieri watches. Mozart stays for a second, indecisive whether to follow the soprano or help Madame Weber. She catches him looking at her and tries to compose herself. She seats herself at her mirror and removes her wig. Salieri looks astonished. The door opens. Constanze enters. Mozart hurries Constanze out of the door. Cavalieri looks after them as they go, her voice breaking and rising out of control. The old man speaks passionately to the priest. The young Salieri is kneeling in desperation before the Cross. CU, Christ staring from the Cross. We see Leopold kneeling now not to the Cross but to Archbishop Colloredo, sitting impassively on his throne. Leopold is a desperate, once-handsome man of sixty, now far too much the subservient courtier. In deepest gratitude he kisses the Archbishop's hand. He motions Leopold to rise. The camera pulls back to see that he is in fact kneeling beside Constanze. A PRIEST faces them. Behind them are Madame Weber, Josefa and Sophie Weber, and a very few others. Among them, a merry looking lady in bright clothes: the BARONESS. Out of breath, the Princess nods nervously. He smiles at Salieri. Salieri's face falls, almost imperceptibly. A SERVANT enters. Salieri goes into the salon. Constanze stands, closely veiled, holding a portfolio stuffed with manuscripts. Salieri enters the salon. Constanze drops him a shy curtsey. Shyly, she unveils. He takes the portfolio and puts it on a table. He indicates a dish piled high with glazed chestnuts. He offers her the dish. She takes one and puts it in her mouth. He watches carefully. He takes one himself. We notice on his finger a heavy gold signet-ring. He smiles at her. She takes another chestnut. The old man faces the Priest. CU, The manuscript in Mozart's handwriting. The Court Composer, oblivious to Constanze, who sits happily chewing chestnuts, her mouth covered in sugar, walks around and around his salon, reading the pages and dropping them on the floor when he is done with them. We see his agonized and wondering face: he shudders as if in a rough and tumbling sea; he experiences the point where beauty and great pain coalesce. More pages fall than he can read, scattering across the floor in a white cascade, as he circles the room.",
    "477": "Salieri sits at his desk. It is littered with manuscripts. In the middle stands a billiard table. The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi plays in the background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table. From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation. Mozart comes out. Framed in the doorway from outside stands Lorl, the maid we noticed in Salieri's house. From his bedroom Leopold peeps out to watch. Mozart goes to the girl. Constanze follows. The old man emerges from his bedroom. Constanze looks furiously at him, then at Lorl. Lorl goes outside and closes the door. Constanze turns on Leopold. A hand comes into frame offering a plate of sugared biscuits. On its finger we see the gold signet ring belonging to Salieri. He hands her a pile of coins. She accepts them, delighted. To its lively music, the door of the house bursts open and a grand forte-piano augmented with a pedal is carried out of it by six men, who run off with it down the street. Following them immediately appear Wolfgang, Constanze and Leopold, all three dressed for an occasion. They climb into a waiting carriage which drives off after the forte-piano. As soon as it goes, Lorl appears in the doorway, peering slyly around to see that they are out of sight. Then she shuts the door. She hurries off in the opposite direction. An outdoor concert is being given. Mozart is actually playing the final movement of his E-flat concerto with an orchestra. Listening to him is a sizable audience, including the Emperor, flanked by Strack and Von Swieten. The crowd is in a happy and appreciative mood: it is a delightful open-air scene. Leopold and Constanze listen to Mozart, who plays his own work brilliantly. A carriage clopping through the streets. Lorl is sitting up on the box beside the driver. Inside the vehicle, we glimpse the figure of Salieri. Mozart is conducting and playing in a reflective mood. Lorl is opening the door admitting Salieri. They go in. The door shuts. The room is considerably tidier as a result of Lorl's ministrations. Salieri stands looking about him with tremendous curiosity. She opens a drawer in a sideboard. Inside we see one gold snuff box: it is the one we saw Mozart being presented with as a child in the Vatican. Salieri turns to look around him. She points across the room to the workroom. Salieri crosses and goes in alone.",
    "478": "Salieri enters the private quarters of Amadeus. He moves slowly into the 'holy of holies' picking up objects with great reverence - a billiard ball; a discarded wig; a sock; a buckle - then objects more important to him. Standing at Mozart's desk, strewn with manuscripts, he picks up Mozart's pen and strokes the feather. He touches the inkstand. Stealthily he picks them up. CU, The pages. Then another page - the title page - written in Mozart's hand. CU, Salieri. He stares amazed. They all sit, save Mozart. The room suddenly looks like a tribunal. All look at the Emperor. Then Joseph nods. Mozart falls on his knees. He giggles. Mozart sits on stage at a harpsichord rehearsing the singers taking the parts of Figaro and Susanna in the opening bars of the first act of The Marriage of Figaro. We watch Figaro measuring the space for his bed on the floor, singing and Susanna looking on, trying on the Countess' hat. Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno are sitting with Salieri. The company disperses, curious. The musicians look at Orsini- Rosenberg. Mozart hands him the score from which he is conducting. He rips out a page. Bonno watches in terror. He goes on tearing the pages determinedly. A servant opens the door to announce. He grabs Salieri. He kisses Salieri's hand. Mozart giggles with relief and gratitude. The Emperor steals in surreptitiously with Von Strack, his finger to his lips. He motions everyone not to rise, and slips into a chair behind Salieri, Orsini-Rosenberg and Bonno. The three conspirators look at each other wide-eyed. The recitativo summons up the march, but instead there is silence. Everyone on stage looks lost, though they attempt to go on with the story for a while. Consternation grows on the faces of the conspirators. Mozart glances back at the group seated in the theatre. Finally, the Emperor speaks, in a whisper. Mozart strains to hear what they are saying but cannot. We do look at them. Orsini-Rosenberg acknowledges his defeat. Orsini-Rosenberg rises and goes down to where Mozart sits anxiously with the musicians, watching his approach. CU, Salieri in his box, tears on his cheeks. He watches the ensemble and we listen to it for a long moment. He bows too, giggling. Cavalieri, in a mythological Persian costume, is bowing to the rapturous throng; below her is Salieri. We see the Emperor, Von Strack, Orsini-Rosenberg, Bonno and Von Swieten, all applauding. Then suddenly at: CU, Mozart standing in a box and clapping wildly. Behind him, seated, are Schikaneder and the three girls we saw before in Mozart's apartment. CU, Salieri staring fixedly at Mozart, then Mozart still clapping, apparently with tremendous enthusiasm. Salieri bows his head.",
    "482": "Mary opens door, looks in. Cassidy is drinking from a large tumbler, winks at her without pausing in his drinking. Mary remains on threshold a moment, then crosses to the desk, talking as she goes. Mary slams down on the brake, tries to pull herself together. The Patrolman raps again, less gently. Reluctantly, Mary rolls down the window. The Patrolman studies her for a moment. Mary pulls her handbag up from the floor, where she'd placed it when she stretched out for sleep. She puts her hand in it, rummages for her wallet, cannot find it. The Patrolman is staring at her. She glances at him nervously, pokes in her bag a bit more, sighs, realizes she'll have to remove some of its contents. Nervously, badly controlling her fear, she takes out the money-filled envelope, and then the important papers envelope, filled then a couple of other items, places them on the seat, finally finds her wallet, opens it, hands it to him. He looks at the wallet, then at the car. The Patrolman walks around to the front of the car, checks the license plate, and returns. The Patrolman peers in, checks the car registration on the steering wheel, returns Mary's wallet. She takes it, looks at him for a flicker of a moment. She starts ahead, fast. As she drives, she glances into her rear-view mirror. The Patrolman is following in his automobile, keeping behind her at a matched speed. She glances out at her surroundings. The Freeway ahead. She suddenly turns off the highway. She checks her mirror. The Patrolman is no longer following, has not turned off after her. She breathes a sigh of relief, thinks a moment, makes a quick decision. Mary gets out of the car, glances toward the lot office, turns her attention to the line of cars, notice the California licence plates on all of them. The CAR DEALER calls out from his office. Mary nods, starts walking along the line of cars as if making a selection. Her eye is caught by the iron newspaper stand on the corner, just outside the lot. She stares at the papers, turns away, as if what she is fearing would have to be impossible, then, having to satisfy herself, goes to the stand, drops a dime in the iron slot, picks up a LOS ANGELES newspaper, starts back into the car lot as she glances worried at the front page. As she goes, we see, coming up the street toward the lot, the same PATROLMAN. He sees Mary, slows, swerves over to the opposite side of the street, stops by the curb. Mary, engrossed in the newspaper, and walking back ease the lot, does not see the Patrolman.",
    "483": "The car dealer is out on the lot now, standing and waiting for Mary. As she approaches, lost in her newspaper, he smiles. She stops suddenly, almost with a gasp. She has seen the Patrolman. He is staring over at her, his face dispassionate. Mary has to force herself to look away. He starts into Mary's car. She stands in the middle of the lot, feeling like a shooting target. He still watches. With a self-angry sigh of resignment, she goes to a close car, looks at it. The Car Dealer is returning. As the car dealer looks at her in amazement, she reaches into her bag, feels the money-filled envelope, pauses. Mary pauses, turns, sees the Patrolman, then the Mechanic. Then the Mechanic waves, starts forward with her suitcase. The Mechanic smiles, throws the suitcase in. Mary zooms off. As she drives out of lot we see the Mechanic, the Car Dealer and the Patrolman all looking after her. Mary is driving tensely. CAMERA IS CLOSE on Mary's face now, recording her anxiety, her fears. Mary looks weary, tired with strain and with hard driving. Her eyes are heavy with worry and deep thought. We can see that it is much later in the day, almost dusk. Now we cut to the view of the road, from Mary's viewpoint. Darkness of evening is coming. In the dim twilight we see the neon sign of roadside restaurants and gas stations beginning to blaze on. Back on Mary's face, and after a moment, the imagined voices again. A flush of painful guilt and regret rises up in Mary's face. The first oncoming headlights slash at the windshield. The oncoming headlights blurt at her. It is completely dark now, night. Oncoming headlights throw a blinding light across her features. Big drops of rain begin to appear. She is becoming aware of the rain starting. The rain increasing and backlit by the oncoming headlights. Mary starts the windshield wipers. The wipers are having a battle with the now torrential rain. Peering through the blurred windshield. slowing down in the flooding highway. peering through the windshield. The oncoming lights are fewer. just blackness and rain. peering. An almost undiscernible light in the far distance, a neon sign blurred by the rain-sheeted windshield. She presses down, forces the car to move on through the flooded road. The lights are on within the office. She tries door, finds it open, goes into office. Mary goes to the desk, rings a small pushbell. She looks off in another direction, slightly behind the office, and sees. A path from the motel office leads directly up to this house. There is a light on in one of the upstairs rooms.",
    "49": "She shrinks back. Then he throws it into her lap. As he continues to speak he punctuates each phrase or so with another lit match. REGGIE is too busy beating them out to do anything else. As she frantically beats out the matches, her eyes on her work. She notices her hand is shaking. She reaches back into her bag, removes a piece of candy, puts it into her mouth and leans her head back against the wall, closing her eyes. Suddenly the door opens and REGGIE shrieks -- but this time it is PETER. REGGIE and PETER enter the deserted lobby. She goes to the desk, followed by PETER, where the NIGHT CLERK greets them sleepily. They go to the elevator where he opens the door for her. As REGGIE and PETER enter the small cage. It is somewhat cramped, forcing them to stand close together. The elevator stops. He reaches across her and opens the door. She stops as she sees something. Instead of a human hand there is a twin-pronged metal one. SCOBIE sees where REGGIE is staring; looks down at it himself, then lunges at her, raising the hand to strike. The hand is starting to come down. REGGIE, moving quickly, turns and flies out. As REGGIE runs out, slamming the door after her, the metal hand crashes against the wooden panel inside the door and splinters through it, visible on this side now. Petrified with fear, REGGIE can only stare dumbly at the protruding claw. As PETER comes running up to her. He sees the metal hand. Then, using all his weight, he slams the door open as far as it will go, making sure to hold it that way as he steps in. Inside, PETER pulls back the door and slugs the startled SCOBIE full on the jaw. His head bangs against the wall but he manages to raise a foot and push PETER violently away, sending him sprawling back, toppling across the bed and over, head first, onto the floor on the other side, where he disappears. Hurrying, SCOBIE puts his foot against the door and pushes it away, ripping his metal hand free. He then rushes to the open window and climbs out. REGGIE waits anxiously. When she hears nothing, she gingerly looks into the room. PETER goes, unsteady on his feet, to the window and looks out. He then turns back. He climbs out. Outside the window to REGGIE's room is a small, false balcony, consisting mostly of railing, with barely enough room between it and the building's facade for a man to stand. PETER appears and looks down over the railing. SHOOTING STRAIGHT DOWN; there is no one on the street and it is too far to jump.",
    "492": "Malcolm stares up at the historic Philadelphia church quietly. Its old stone and huge towers make it stand out from the modern buildings all around it. He has to use all his strength to push open the highly ornate doors. He slips inside. Only a few people sit and pray in the sea of oak pews. Malcolm scans the majestic room and finds what he's looking for in the last row of the church. He moves down the center aisle towards the back. Malcolm finds Cole playing in his pew with a set of green and beige plastic soldiers. Cole makes the soldiers talk to each other. Cole stays rigid. Hands clutching a handful of plastic riflemen. Malcolm nods at the information. Malcolm smiles at Cole. His eyes drift down to Cole's arms. Cole's arms are covered in TINY CUTS AND BRUISES. Cole and Malcolm just stare at each other. Lynn walks over to Cole. Checks his tie. Lynn unclips the tie. Cole takes a seat at the kitchen table as Lynn walks back into the laundry room. The dog is gone now. Lynn reaches into the dryer, digging for a new tie. She finds one, then turns and steps back into the kitchen and SCREAMS AT THE TOP OF HER LUNGS. Every cabinet and every drawer is wide open. Cole sits at the kitchen table. His hands are pressed flat on the tabletop. He looks shaken. Neither says anything for a beat. Lynn looks over to the open cabinet near the sink. The pop tarts are clearly visible. Lynn leans down. Cole does. He looks at her eyes. Cole turns to see Lynn holding the pop tarts. He walks back and takes them from her before leaving. Lynn glances to the kitchen table. Her gaze stops on the TWO TINY HAND PRINTS OF SWEAT formed on the table's surface. TOMMY TAMMISIMO is a tough-looking, eight-year-old Italian kid who waits at the bottom of Cole's brownstone stairs in his school uniform. Cole emerges from the brownstone and moves down the steps. The two boys begin their walk down the street to school. Tommy puts his arm around Cole. Cole waves back. When the two boys turn the corner and are out of Lynn's sight, Tommy rips his arm away. Cole starts to smile too. He thinks. Cole and Lynn smile at each other. Lynn takes Cole's school bag and jacket before moving to the kitchen. The den doubles as a playroom. Boxes of old toys sit in the corner. A small, plastic, multi-colored table sits on the rug. Cole appears in the doorway. Malcolm sits up and smiles.",
    "496": "Tiny statues of saints surround the interior perimeter. We see the statue Cole stole from the church is in here. This tent is a sanctuary made by an eight-year-old to hide in. Some are villagers, others are dressed as trees and animals. Cole comes on stage holding a painted cardboard monkey. The arched halls of the private school are lined with posted drawings and test papers. Cole and Malcolm walk down an empty hall. They continue down the hall in silence. Malcolm takes his time. Malcolm stops at a set of doors at the end of the hall -- realizes Cole is no longer next to him. Malcolm turns to find Cole frozen about ten feet back. Malcolm walks to him. He notices Cole's expression as he gets closer. Climbing ropes hang from the wood beamed ceiling. Malcolm looks to Cole and then turns back to the ceiling. Malcolm's body becomes very still. Malcolm looks at the wood beams and climbing ropes. Malcolm glances at Cole. Malcolm turns back to Cole, he finds the child with tears in his eyes. Cole looks at Malcolm desperately. Malcolm stares helplessly. A BLACK MAN in britches and no shirt, face beaten to a pulp, hangs in the center. A WHITE WOMAN in a torn white frilly dress -- tears soaking her face, hangs to the right. A small MIXED RACE CHILD in half pants, hangs to their left. The family stares at Cole. Lynn fiddles with the dials. Cole is standing before the beat-up twelve inch kitchen T.V. ON THE TELEVISION SCREEN is Tommy Tammisimo. He stands in his pajamas in a doorway. Cole removes the gloves from his hand and places them next to his plate. Cole moves them to the floor. Lynn is irritated, this is a sore point between them. Lynn and Cole eat quietly. Cole looks up. An anxious expression on his face. Cole just stares. Cole looks down at his lap. Lynn just stares at Cole. Lynn folds her napkin quietly. Cole's eyes start to water up. Cole just stares at his mother's expression. Cole gets up -- never taking his eyes off his mother -- and leaves the room. Cole enters the DARK HALLWAY. He gets startled by the SOUND. Sebastian comes racing down the hall and scurries past Cole. Cole watches his puppy dart into the living room and under a couch. Cole slowly turns back and looks down the hall. THE DOOR TO COLE'S ROOM SITS AT THE END OF THE CORRIDOR. Cole stops breathing. Cole is too terrified to move. Lynn is kneeling on the kitchen floor trying to coax the puppy out of the broom closet. Lynn fights back some tears. Lynn hugs him.",
    "499": "He stares statue-like at an abstract point in the room. The man slowly turns and looks down at the boy standing next to him. Cole is very shaky. Malcolm watches everything anxiously. Cole stares at Mr. Collins. The man's face begins to crumble. Cole holds out the jewelry box. It trembles with his hands. The father just stares at it. The father becomes very still. His eyes fill with a storm of confusion and pain. After the longest time, the father reaches and gently takes the box out of Cole's small hands. Cole begins to back away. The father gazes at Cole as he melts into the crowd. Cole reaches Malcolm and the two then slip out of the house. The father looks down in a daze. He goes to open the jewelry box. His movements are slow and strained. He lifts the latch and open the box. Mr. Collins stares at an unlabeled video cassette. Mr. Collins is seated now. Her father's face forms the most heartbreaking of smiles as he watches the performance. The puppets go limp. The entire stage gets lifted up. We see it carried away by Kyra. We can view the whole bedroom now. The camera is seated on her desk in the corner. Kyra climbs in bed and pretends to be sleeping when the door opens. She carries in a tray of soup and a sandwich. The crowd watches in riveted silence. The father never takes his eyes off of the screen. The image of the mother walks to a closet. She pulls out a bottle of floor cleaner. Reads the label for the ingredients. Walks back to the food tray, where she unscrews the cap on the floor cleaner. The mother pours some into the cap. Kyra picks up the spoon and takes a sip. Kyra slowly brings the spoon to her mouth and swallows another spoonful. The ROOM IS UTTERLY SILENT. Mrs. Collins is seated at the dining room surrounded by friends and family. She fixes one of the many bouquets of flowers on the table. It takes her a beat before she feels the stare. She looks up. Standing in the doorway to the dining room is Mr. Collins. A group of ashen faced guests stand in the distance behind him. Husband and wife's eyes meet. Mr. Collins' eyes tremble with tears. The four-year-old stares at the finger puppet, then quietly takes it in her small hands. The two children don't say anything for a while. Malcolm glances to the house, where all movements in and out of the home has ceased. Malcolm looks across the two children on the swings. Stanley Cunningham moves between two curtains and comes to a prop room door in the back.",
    "5": "The Colonel is deeply troubled. The door swings open silently and the Colonel enters. He starts going through Ricky's bureau. He opens the drawer in which we know Ricky keeps his marijuana, but he doesn't discover its false bottom. He stands and looks around, his eyes finally landing on the Digicam and a stack of cassettes on a shelf. Barbara Fitts sits at the kitchen table, staring off into space. He takes the cassette out of the Digicam and inserts another. His face tightens. On the TV screen we see. The Colonel sinks slowly onto Ricky's bed, mesmerized. Then, naked except for his black socks, he grabs the dumbbells and starts lifting them, watching his reflection in the window as he does. The camera is still connected to the TV. Lester, wearing a Mr. Smiley's uniform, is happily flipping burgers on a grill. Lester looks up suddenly when he hears. Lester's face darkens, then he smiles. He puts his spatula down. The Mercedes pulls around to the drive-thru window. Carolyn drives; Buddy sits beside her. They are too involved with each other to notice Lester watching them from the drive-thru window. Lester leans out of the drive-thru window, grinning at her, holding bags filled with fast food. The Counter Girl stands next to him, staring blankly. Carolyn almost jumps out of her skin. Carolyn struggles to appear nonchalant. The sky is filled with ominous gray clouds. Wind whips garbage across the parking lot as Carolyn's Mercedes pulls in next to Buddy's Jaguar. Carolyn grips the wheel tightly, staring straight ahead. Buddy looks at her unhappily. He just looks at her sadly, then gets out of the car and shuts the door. She starts to cry. Buddy's Jaguar speeds off, leaving the Mercedes alone in the parking lot. She closes her eyes tight, trying to stop the tears, then suddenly screams as loud as she can. We can still hear Carolyn's muffled screaming. He puts the weights down and looks at his reflection in the window: His arms are pumped. He reaches under the bench and grabs a cigar box. He smiles. Opening it, he digs through marijuana paraphernalia, only to pull out an empty Zip-loc bag. Ricky and the Colonel sit at the table, eating in silence. Ricky pulls his beeper off his belt and checks it. He heads into the hall. The Colonel watches him go, uneasy. It's raining outside. Angela drives, squinting through the windshield as the wipers move back and forth. Something outside catches his eye, and he cranes his neck to get a better look at. Through the window over the sink, we can see into the Burnham's garage window. Our view is blurred by the rain, but we see Lester, his upper body pumped and glistening in sweat as he counts out a wad of bills.",
    "50": "He now looks around. REGGIE's is the last such balcony on one side, but there are two or three on the other. PETER climbs over the railing and, holding on to it with one hand, reaches for the railing on the next balcony. As it stretches for the railing; it is several inches short of touching it. As he straightens up and prepares to jump. From the GROUND. PETER, high above, jumps to the next balcony. As he climbs over the railing of the second balcony. He sees a light coming through the window and looks in. From the GROUND as PETER jumps to the next balcony. As he climbs over the rail to the third balcony. There is a light coming from this window, too. PETER looks in. Inside the room are GIDEON, TEX, and SCOBIE in the midst of a heated discussion. SCOBIE turns and storms out of the door, slamming it. There is a KNOCK at the door. REGGIE unlocks the door and opens it. PETER enters and she closes the door again. PETER is silent for a moment. She falls in his arms to be comforted. He takes out his handkerchief and dries her eyes. The phone rings. REGGIE answers it. SCOBIE holds the receiver in his metal hand. REGGIE's back is turned to PETER so he can't see her face. He watches her. She shakes her head. He hangs up. Slowly, REGGIE lowers the 'phone from her ear and hangs it up. She hesitates a moment. As PETER (now called DYLE) leaves REGGIE's room and closes the door. He pauses for a moment, listening, hears nothing, then bends down and starts pulling at a loose thread in one of his socks. As usual, the thread unravels -- and unravels -- and unravels some more until it seems that the entire sock has come unknit. Now, taking the long thread, he bends down near the door and, taking his tie-pin, attaches one end of the thread to the bottom of REGGIE's door. He then runs the thread along the floor to his door (next door) and works it underneath. REGGIE is on the phone. BARTHOLOMEW on the phone. He is silent for a moment, his face troubled. BARTHOLOMEW looks at her for a moment, then glances around; his attention is drawn inside the doorway. Almost as far as the eye can see, row upon row of beef sides, hung on hooks. As REGGIE looks at the hanging beef. REGGIE and BARTHOLOMEW sit at the table. BARTHOLOMEW pulls out a package and she takes one, looks at it and rips off the filter tip. He winces. She puts the other end in her mouth, then picks up the matches and lights it.",
    "501": "It's called the SILVER BULLET. The sign flashes COCKTAILS -- BEER -- DANCING -- FOOD. There is a huge gravel parking lot with lots of pickup trucks and older cars. Even though it's early, you can tell this place is a real night spot. It's already pretty crowded. This place is jumpin'. There are ten pool tables with crowds all around. The long bar is filled with customers. There are tables and booths. The room is dense with smoke. There is a dance floor, but no one is dancing yet because the band is still setting up. There are a lot of single men. Many heads turn and follow Thelma and Louise to an empty table. A WAITRESS comes over and drops two menus on the table. As the Waitress leaves. As the Waitress returns. The Waitress returns with Louise's drink. Louise understands. Harlan laughs. Thelma laughs, too, but doesn't really get the joke. Harlan leaves. Thelma knocks back her shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass to the Waitress to bring her another one. They both drift off momentarily, contemplating their domestic problems, until the Waitress comes over. Thelma looks over at the bar where Harlan is grinning at her, making dancing motions. She smiles and waves at him. Her face becomes serious again as she turns back to Louise. Thelma's mind goes too fast for her mouth, and the speed at which she speaks can be staggering. Louise is used to it. Louise smiles wistfully at Thelma's assessment of the situation. She again drinks her whole shot of Wild Turkey and holds up her glass, as the BAND strikes up a lively tune. Louise drinks her shot of tequila and holds up her glass, too. Thelma is dancing with Harlan and has been for quite a while. Louise has been dancing with a quiet guy named DAN. Thelma is breathless, drunk and giggly. She holds a beer bottle in one hand. She is laughing a lot about nothing, and Harlan is studying her closely. Louise notices this. Louise heads off to the bathroom. She stumbles a step and drops her beer bottle. Louise is heading towards the bathroom, where there is a line of at least fifteen women in front of her. He steers her towards the door. Harlan is hauling Thelma out the door into the parking lot. She is pretty limp. Harlan is leaning close to Thelma's head, and she pulls her head away. He pulls her to him and tries to put his arms around her. Thelma pulls away. Louise comes out of the bathroom as the next woman goes in. She scans the room looking for Thelma. She goes over to the table and sees Thelma's stuff there.",
    "506": "Thelma hops in quickly. Louise careens back onto the road. Louise slams on the brakes. Louise stops yelling for a moment groping for self-control. Thelma looks pitiful. The T-Bird flashes by on a road that looks a lot like Route. Louise passes him and, as she does, he HONKS. They look up and he is wildly pointing to his lap. Thelma is laughing wildly. Thelma has just crossed the line from laughing to crying. They both get quiet. Thelma leans back just watching Louise. She studies her as if she's never really seen her before. All of a sudden a look of shocked realization comes over Thelma's face. She jerks upright and startles Louise. Louise knows what she is talking about. She becomes immediately agitated. Louise looks as if she is looking for a way to flee. Louise's eyes are wild, not seeing, while Thelma now seems completely serene. The car is SCREAMING down the road. They drive through a little stand of buildings. A car speeds up to try and catch them. The red and blue lights pop on. It is a New Mexico State Patrol car. Louise sees the lights in the rearview mirror. Thelma jumps awake. They are trying not to panic. The patrol car is right behind them. Louise pulls the car off the road. The patrol car pulls up right behind them. The lights shine brightly in through the windows. Louise does. The PATROLMAN gets out of his car and approaches their car. He comes to the driver's side window. PATROLMAN'S POV OF LOUISE smiling up at him. She does. Louise fumbles in her purse for her wallet, opens it and shows her license. They walk to the back of the car. He notes the license plate number. Patrolman gets in the driver's side. He picks up a clipboard and clips Louise's driver's license to it. He picks up the hand mike for the radio and, as he does, a hand with a gun comes in his car window. It's Thelma and she puts the gun to his head. He drops it. Louise reaches over and takes his gun. Louise SHOOTS the car radio. The cop flinches with each shot. Louise fires TWO SHOTS into the police radio. It BLASTS all to hell. Louise reaches over and takes the keys. She takes her license off the clipboard. She gets out and trots around to the back of the car. Thelma is holding the gun on the Patrolman. Suddenly Thelma FIRES the gun, blowing two holes into the trunk cover. Louise opens the trunk. As he's climbing into the trunk, Thelma explains to Louise. They are in really beautiful country now. A cop walks into the kitchen and hands Hal a file that says Louise Elizabeth Sawyer on the outside.",
    "508": "We're at a Comic Book show, specifically at a book-signing. Holden sits at a table. Beside it is a large mock-up of the comic book cover which features two stoner super-heroes who bear a striking resemblance to a pair of very familiar friendly neighborhood drug dealers. Holden hands the book back to the Fan. He offers him a patronizingly kind, half-smile in return. Across from the barely-managing-to-stand Fan, BANKY signs the book of another COLLECTOR. Banky freezes up. He composes himself and continues signing. A LITTLE KID steps up but the Collector lingers. Holden accepts a comic from another Fan. He looks to his left and freaks. Banky is throttling the Collector from across the table. The Collector attempts to fight him off. SECURITY GUARDS pull them apart. The Security Guards drag the collector away. Holden grabs Banky. HOOPER fills the frame. He comes off like a typical, pro-black/anti-white homeboy. During the speech, Holden and Banky enter and sit up front. Hooper whips his head around, looking for the source of the comment. Hooper explodes. He pulls a nine millimeter from his belt, draws on Banky and fires. Banky goes down, falling forward into the crowd. The crowd screams and starts to scatter. Hooper jumps over the table and raises his fists in the air. The crowd is gone. Holden sits in his chair, laughing. Hooper steps off the stage and picks Banky's head up off the floor. Hooper sounds different. Actually, he sounds gay. Banky smiles. They turn to see a beautiful, blonde, ruffled-haired angel swinging her purse in a circle. Her name is ALYSSA. Holden hits him. Banky seethes. Banky offers Holden a puzzled glance. Then he nods to Hooper. Holden, Banky, Alyssa and Hooper sit around a table drinking, talking, and smoking. Banky and Hooper exit, leaving Alyssa and Holden alone at the table. Alyssa laughs. Holden smiles. A dart hits the board then, one hits the wall beside the board. Alyssa winds up with another dart. Holden watches. Through the window, we see a COUPLE making out on the hood of a car. Alyssa exits to the night. Holden stares after her. Two beats later, Hooper and Banky enter, holding an 'Everything's Archie' comic between them. Banky runs out. Holden shrugs at Hooper. Holden answers it, while still drawing. Hooper's tending bar. It's a club - people are mingling, a band is playing, it's loud. The Guy sips it. Holden enters. ON THE DANCE FLOOR - in the middle of a thrall of people - dances Alyssa. She moves like a cat and she's looking very sexy. Hooper, Holden, and Banky stare OC. Holden smacks Banky and moves to exit. Banky looks around.",
    "509": "People clap. Holden looks at her. The SINGER on stage speaks into the microphone. The crowd applauds. Alyssa shakes her head, smiling. Holden pokes her. Alyssa shakes her head no. The crowd urges her. Alyssa offers the Singer an embarrassed half-smile. Holden pushes her forward. Alyssa shakes her head and relents, heading through the crowd. The crowd thunders. Banky and Hooper stand at the bar. The crowd cheers. Alyssa laughs. She turns to the band and says something which they nod. She turns back to the crowd. Holden smiles. Alyssa launches into a torchy tune. Banky joins him. Holden glances at him. Banky offers a mocking mimic of his smile. Holden is smiling, being seduced, Banky rolls his eyes. Beside Holden, stands a pretty GIRL with a short haircut, who's also riveted by Alyssa's performance. Alyssa makes big-time eye contact with somebody out there. The song seems to be aimed at whoever she's looking at. At the end of the song, the crowd goes wild but Alyssa's preoccupied. She points to someone in the crowd, and curls her finger back in a `c'mere' fashion, urging whoever it is to join her. She jumps off the stage. Holden shakes his head sheepishly and looks downward, aw- shucks style. At that moment, the girl beside him leaps forward. Alyssa and the girl race into each other's arms and fall into a way-to-passionate-to-mean-anything-else kiss. Holden looks up and is suddenly taken aback. Banky's eyes widen. Banky allows a smile to creep across his face. The crowd applauds. Holden's eyes bug. Banky looks around, and for the first time, we get the distinct impression that this is a lesbian bar. There are a lot of chicks in this place. Holden continues to stare - mouth agape. Banky looks at Holden and slaps him on the back. Alyssa and the girl continue to kiss. Banky, Holden, Alyssa and the girl from the dance floor sit around a table. Alyssa and the girl continue to make out. Holden and Banky casually watch, wide-eyed. Banky stares a little harder. Holden hits him. Alyssa and the girl break their kiss. Kim exits. Alyssa looks at him. Banky is smiling ear-to-ear. Banky and Alyssa laugh. Holden looks at a small scar on his arm and thinks better about mentioning it. Then Kim re-enters and plants a big kiss on Alyssa's neck. Alyssa waves at him as he exits. Banky slides out of the booth. Holden reaches in and pulls Banky out. Alyssa watches them go, then turns and kisses Kim. Holden looks preoccupied. The Receptionist stops typing and looks at Banky, shocked. Banky flips through magazines, biting off mini pieces of the gum he's chewing. JOHN SLOSS, the boy's lawyer, joins them.",
    "510": "Banky leans back into the couch, wearing a thoughtful face. The Execs and Sloss laugh. Holden and Banky politely join in. Banky shoots Holden a `these guys are idiots' look. Holden smiles. Alyssa and Holden walk through the park, eating hot dogs. They come to a swing set and sit down on the swings. Alyssa holds up her hand. Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her tongue, which is just huge. Holden is transfixed. Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing. She exits. Holden remains in the swing. Alyssa comes back in. Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage. Holden checks his beeper. Holden exits. Banky starts packing his mags up. A little KID enters, staring at him. And he's gone. Banky stands there, open-mouthed. They head toward the skee-ball runs. Holden rolls the ball. It pops into a twenty point circle. Alyssa picks up a ball, squints to aim, and whips it overhand. It pops off one of the circles and shoots back at them, missing them as they duck. Holden reacts as Alyssa laughs. Holden ducks as the ball comes sailing back at his head. He gets up. Holden whips the ball in surprise. It ricochets off the ceiling and through the glass of an old pinball machine. Holden looks around, nervously. Alyssa laughs. Banky sits there, shocked. He puts the controller down and crosses to the drawing table. Holden starts drawing. Banky stares at him. He starts drawing something. Banky draws a four-way stop. Banky finishes drawing. He illustrates according to his voice-over. Holden's shaking his head. Holden storms away. Banky follows. Holden looks at Banky for a long beat. Banky stares at him. Suddenly, he softens a bit. He drops his head. Banky looks into Holden's eyes. Holden stares back. Banky walks away. Holden watches him go and exits. Alyssa picks through her food. Holden and Alyssa sit at a booth. She grabs her bag and slides out of the booth. Holden watches her, then follows. Alyssa slides up to the cashier's desk as does Holden, who offers a puzzled shrug. Alyssa offers the 'just wait' finger. The CASHIER turns to her. Holden stares at her. Holden stares ahead. Then he swerves the wheel to the right. The car pulls to the side of the road. Holden throws the car into park. The rain is a bit heavier now. Holden stares at Alyssa. She stares back. Then she gets out of the car. Holden gets out of the car. It's raining pretty hard now. Alyssa's hitching up the road. Holden reaches her. She looks at him, rain drenching the pair. She shakes her head ruefully. She walks away. Holden stands there, at a loss. Then he turns and heads back to his car.",
    "516": "She listens to the music, her eyes closed. The record plays for a few moments in the quiet room, as Elliot walks over to Lee and leans against the shelf near her. Lee, smiling, continues to listen to the music, her head down; Elliot stares at her. Elliot nods. Elliot stares at Lee, who continues to look down, her arms around her chest. Lee looks down again; the music plays softly and Elliot continues to stare at her, thinking. As Elliot's thoughts are heard over the scene, Lee glances around the loft, then begins to walk away. The camera follows her as she goes past the nude drawings, which become the focus of attention as Lee walks offscreen. Lee walks back onscreen, to the bookshelf behind the drawings. She takes the Edward Estlin Cummings book from the shelf and flips through it as she walks back to Elliot, who is still leaning by the stereo, still ruminating. Elliot leaps up, grabs Lee, and kisses her passionately. Lee, surprised, pushes him away. He kisses Lee again. He clumsily turns around; she bumps against the stereo unit. As Lee pulls away, she smashes into the turntable. Lee, shocked, is gasping. Elliot quickly turns away from Lee. She tries to compose herself and the film cuts to the loft entranceway. Frederick enters the loft first, followed by a confused Dusty. They stride across the loft past Lee, who is standing by the stereo. Elliot, standing near the nude drawings, is looking through a book. Dusty settles down in the backseat and closes the door. Elliot leans down to the chauffeur's window, signaling for him to start driving. The limousine drives off. Elliot runs to a phone booth across the street. He picks up the phone and dials. The film cuts to Frederick in his loft, standing near the phone. Frederick picks it up. When no one answers, Frederick, reacting, hangs up, and the film moves back outside to the phone booth, where Elliot, the phone receiver to his ear, listens for a moment, then hangs up. He walks out of the booth, reacting, then walks down the sidewalk, where he bumps into a frantic Lee, just turning the corner. Elliot, uneasy, glances up in the direction of Frederick's loft. He leads Lee a few yards up the street, away from any prying eyes. She sighs. Lee looks at him. She sighs. She walks off. Elliot stares after her, grinning. He laughs. A taxi turns a West Side street corner and stops in front of Evan and Norma's building, which is decorated with a long metal awning. It's an overcast day. A station wagon on the opposite side of the street pulls away as Hannah, a white scarf fluttering over her shoulder, gets out of the cab.",
    "520": "He takes a bite of his sandwich and a sip of coffee. Lee runs into the kitchen, her hands tight around her chest. Lee, fraught with emotion, briefly puts her outstretched hands on the refrigerator door, then turns around and leans against it, hugging herself, her blouse still unbuttoned, her hair still wet and bedraggled. Frederick enters the kitchen area and leans against the counter. Frederick cringes, reacting. He puts his hand to his forehead; he sighs. He turns and looks at Lee in surprise. He walks over to Lee in another area of the kitchen. Frederick turns away from Lee. He begins to pace near the counter. He loudly pounds his fist on the counter in despair and frustration, then covers his eyes with his hands in sorrow. He pounds his fist against a cupboard. Lee sets her glass on the kitchen counter and walks towards the bedroom area. She starts to take off her wet clothes by the bed. Frederick takes off his glasses. He pulls Lee down next to him on the bed. She sighs. Lee, gasping, moves away. Frederick furiously shakes Lee away. He puts his hand on his forehead, then turns to the offscreen Lee. Lee turns and faces Frederick in the bathroom doorway. The movie cuts to Lee, standing in the dark in Frederick's loft. She talks softly into the telephone. Lee hangs up the phone and the movie cuts back to Elliot, standing in his living room. Stunned, he slowly lowers the phone receiver. Hannah, wearing a plaid shirt, sits up in bed, a book propped up on her knees. She turns the page as Elliot, in pajamas and silk bathrobe, enters. She continues to read her book as he sits down at the edge of the bed and muses. Elliot frantically stands up and leaves the room. Elliot walks quickly into the darkened hallway. Elliot switches on the light. He paces back and forth in front of the piano and an accompanying music stand. Elliot stops pacing and checks his wristwatch. Elliot jumps. Jazz is heard as the movie cuts to the outside of a university library, the camera focused on a huge replica of Rodin's Thinker before moving to the front entrance. Mickey can be seen emerging from its depths. He ponders the scene as he walks past the statue and a small front garden and down the sidewalk. Passersby, some holding books, are seen. A male jogger, seen through some tree branches, runs by. Several joggers pass Mickey; he continues to ruminate. Mickey goes over to the chain-link fence encircling the reservoir. He stops walking and looks out over the water. Mickey continues to look through the fence at the water and the distant skyline.",
    "522": "Holly stays under the awning; Mickey walks to the curb and looks angrily back at her. People pass by as Mickey walks back and forth from the curb to Holly, growing angrier and angrier. A taxi pulls up to the curb. Mickey and Holly walk up to its rear door. He holds the door open for Holly. She gets in. Holly slams the door. Mickey starts to walk along the sidewalk as the taxi drives off; he passes the hotel and several evening-lit store windows. Both a bus and a taxi drive down the street, blocking Mickey from view. Elliot and Lee can be seen dancing cheek to cheek in the reflection of a mirror over a dresser. Elliot and Lee dance into view. Without missing a beat, Elliot picks up one of the glasses of champagne and hands it to Lee. She sips. Elliot sips, then puts it back down on the dresser. They embrace tightly, continuing to dance. Elliot, Hannah, and the twins sit at the dining room table. Hannah's two adopted children stand by her chair; she is showing them how a small camera works. The children watch her, fascinated, muttering among themselves. Elliot looks listless. He stares blankly at the table. The child takes the camera from Hannah, as well as picking up a second identical one from the table. The adopted children leave, the twins going off with them. When they're gone, Hannah takes a sip of her coffee and looks at Elliot. She puts down her cup, still watching him. Hannah sighs. Elliot angrily throws his napkin on the table. He stands up and begins to pace behind Hannah. He sits down again, in a chair next to Hannah; the ketchup bottle sits in front of him. The camera moves in on Elliot's anguished face. He looks down. Hannah leans over and tenderly puts her hand on his shoulder. She touches his hand; Elliot embraces her. Elliot kisses Hannah again; they embrace tightly. She touches his hair. The screen shows a metal staircase next to a large white column. Holly's voice can be heard as she and Hannah make their way up the stairs, moving into view. A man carrying a shopping bag walks down the steps; he passes them. Holly follows Hannah to a rack of blouses. Hannah takes a jacket on a hanger off the rack and looks at it. She holds it to her. Hannah turns to Holly with surprise. She puts the jacket back on the rack and stares at her; she inhales. Hannah begins to look at the rack of clothes on Holly's side, while her sister stares at her, frowning. Hannah takes a blouse off the rack and looks at it.",
    "524": "Hannah, who'd been mashing some food in a bowl on a nearby counter, hesitates momentarily. She turns to Holly. Hannah, licking her fingers, walks past Holly. Hannah walks past Holly to attend to some food on a different stove. Holly turns to face her. Only Holly is seen as she talks to the offscreen Hannah, the camera moving in closer on her face. As Holly speaks, she distractedly nibbles an hors d'oeuvre. Holly pops another hors d'oeuvre into her mouth as the background singing gets louder and the film cuts to. A child is sprawled out under a blanket on a sofa; some guests chatter quietly; others drink and eat, listening. As they continue to sing, the film cuts back to the kitchen, where Lee, carrying some glasses, enters through the doorway. Lee walks over to her sisters, putting the glasses down on a counter. Hannah is scooping seeds out of a cantaloupe. Holly, leaning on the table, sips her drink. The music from the living room is softly heard as the three sisters chat comfortably and easily with each other. Hannah shakes her head in disapproval while Holly angrily takes another sip of her drink. And the film cuts briefly back to the living room, where Evan is still playing the piano and singing. The camera moves past him and a few guests to Norma, who is enthusiastically singing along, looking at Evan and moving her hands. The table is beautifully set for Thanksgiving dinner, complete with candles, flowers, cut crystal, china, and silver. Hannah's children are playing in the room as Hannah enters, carrying a huge roast turkey. Behind her is Holly, carrying a casserole. The film cuts to April, standing in the doorway of the dining room and holding a drink. Holly groans, looking at her sister, while April sips her drink and nods. Hannah screams with laughter as she walks toward the end of the table, past a gleeful Holly, who points her finger at Hannah as she passes. Hannah, still laughing, playfully pushes the accusing finger away. She walks over to a nearby china cabinet. As Holly continues to tease her sister, Hannah opens a drawer in the cabinet. She takes out two apples decorated with paper turkey heads and tails and hands them to April. While Holly is talking, Hannah hands her the last turkey apple, accidentally sticking her with one of the toothpicks that keeps the decorations in place. He walks out of the bathroom, moving down the hallway towards the camera. Elliot walks into the bedroom as Lee continues to talk offscreen. The camera, leaving Elliot, moves across the room, past a wall of framed paintings, a headboard and bed, a night table and lamp, revealing Lee.",
    "526": "They disappear inside. The camera follows them, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk in. A waiter in uniform stands near its glass and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground. The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation. Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room. She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well. In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away. She takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag. The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area. She signals for the three sisters to follow her. The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus. They sit down. The hostess leaves. Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table. As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth. Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah, as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah. The camera is back on Lee. She looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation. She fidgets. She puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly circles to Hannah's face. She is equally intense, looking at both sisters as she speaks. She opens her menu, then turns to Lee, reacting suddenly to her sister, who is rubbing her forehead, looking terribly upset. The camera moves down the tree to reveal a well-kept, red-brick brownstone on a pleasant, sunny New York City street. A man wearing a summer suit walks by as the film moves inside the building, to Elliot's analyst's office. The psychotherapist sits in a comfortable armchair next to a curtained window. The music stops as the camera moves across the room to reveal Elliot, sitting in a wooden chair. He holds a long, thin cigarette; he wears a gold Rolex watch. Elliot raises his cigarette to take a drag. The camera follows the cigarette up to his face. Elliot looks thoughtful as the movie cuts to. Lee, wearing jeans and carrying an armful of books, is running up a broad set of steps in the sunlight, greeting other students as she passes. Lee stops on a portico and turns to greet Doug, a professor, who is running over to her, calling her name. They mouth hello, smiling, and begin to walk off together. The film cuts back to Elliot in his analyst's office.",
    "527": "Elliot takes a last drag on his cigarette. The camera follows his hand as he crushes it out in a nearby ashtray. Hare Krishna music is heard over a sunlit view of the Manhattan skyline and the green trees of Central Park. The camera moves down to reveal a large group of Hare Krishnas dancing on the broad green lawn among other New Yorkers enjoying the day. The leader, holding some pamphlets, stands by a chain-link fence, a few feet away from his group, talking to someone on the other side. It's Mickey, as the camera soon shows, wearing a short-sleeved shirt, a paper tucked under his arm. Mickey walks off, the Hare Krishnas still dancing and singing on the other side of the fence. He flips through the literature as he walks, then looks straight ahead, pondering. Mickey puts his hand to his mouth as another title appears on a black screen. A bench faces some wharf pilings; the water gently laps against them as Lee walks into view, the wind blowing her hair. She stands and faces the water and the distant skyline across the bay. Lee is alone; her hands are in her pockets. The concerto stops and the movie cuts to Holly, leaning into an open phone booth near a subway entrance. People rush past Holly towards the subway; others are walking up the station steps. Holly smokes a cigarette as she talks on the phone to Hannah. Holly hangs up the phone and takes a drag on her cigarette. She looks off in the distance, smiling, as the film cuts to. Guests are crowded together in the living room, surrounding the piano, where Evan is sitting and flipping through some sheet music. Norma stands behind him, leaning against a book-laden wall. The guests are chattering, enjoying themselves; a lamp glows on the corner of the piano. A little boy sitting in a chair next to Evan is talking animatedly with a girl who is leaning over the arm of the sofa. An adult guest talks to the little boy; another guest takes a sip of wine from a glass she'd placed on the bookshelf behind her as Evan turns and addresses the group. The guests laugh appreciatively. A woman comes over to Evan and hands him some wine. He laughs; the guests laugh with him. The guest continue to laugh; they are charmed. Evan continues to laugh with everyone as he starts to play the piano. A nearby woman toasts him with her drink. The camera moves around the room as he plays, showing the various guests, chattering over the music. Some are in clusters, in private conversations; others listen and watch the offscreen Evan.",
    "533": "Lamps hang down from the ceiling. The classical music still plays in the background. Lee stops at a plastic-enclosed work area. Frederick can be seen working at a drawing board on the other side of the clear plastic screen. As Lee walks over to the drawing board where Frederick is sitting, he is seen intently cleaning some paintbrushes with a rag. Lee stands by him, leaning over the board, and looks directly at him. The table is filled with cans of brushes and artist's equipment. Frederick and Lee embrace; Lee sighs. Lee kisses Frederick twice, then releases him and walks out of the work area. Lee walks over to the loft's stereo area, pulling up the sleeves of her sweater as Frederick talks. Lee picks up a book from the stereo shelf. She leans back against the unit, glancing through its pages. Frederick, leaving his work area, walks past Lee; his hands are in his pockets. The camera stays with Frederick as he walks into the loft's bedroom area. He sits down at the foot of the bed and starts taking off his shoes. Lee sits down next to Frederick; he takes her hand. Lee kisses Frederick back on the cheek. They embrace. Frederick laughs; their embrace gets tighter. Without missing a beat, he takes Mary's wrist and continues walking. As the group walks through a large doorway, Larry catches up to Mickey. The group turns right into a new corridor, briefly off the screen. As the group briskly walks past an open door, Gail, another assistant, runs out, brandishing her glasses. The fast-tracking group turns the corner. Gail pats Mickey's back; she gestures in exasperation. He is interrupted by Ed Smythe, an official from the Standards and Practices Department, who's been standing in the corridor waiting for Mickey. Mickey stops and shakes Ed's hand as if he'd known the official would be there. Gail stops by his side while the others walk into a background studio doorway that is busy with scurrying personnel. A writer, holding a script, walks out of the background studio, looking around. Mickey and Gail walk over to the angry writer, Ed forgotten with this new crisis. Mickey, Gail, and the writer start walking down a corridor adjacent to the studio. The writer reacts angrily. Gail tries to get Mickey's attention as they walk. Mickey, still in surprised shock, turns away from the angry writer. He stands by an open dressing room, where Ron, an actor, slouches, dazed, in a chair facing a makeup mirror. People mill in the background behind the actor. Mickey, remembering Ron, runs into the dressing room. Gail follows him. Inside, a man and a woman talk, ignoring Ron. They share a drink in a paper cup.",
    "538": "Elliot stops walking to browse through some books. Elliot turns and walks back down the center aisle to a row of books he'd already passed. Lee walks over to Elliot in the center aisle. He hands Lee the book. She looks at the book. She thumbs through it, as the movie. Lee, holding the book in a brown bag, and Elliot are walking out. A taxi pulls over to the curb; they walk over to it. Elliot opens the rear door for Lee. She laughs as she gets in. As Lee continues to read aloud, the movie cuts to Elliot's darkened den, lit by a light in the hallway. Elliot enters, wearing a robe, crossing the room in the dark. Elliot turns on a light. The camera stays on his face as he looks off into the distance, mouthing indistinctly the line of poetry Lee next reads. The film leaves Elliot's face and cuts back to the loft, where Lee, having finished the poem, sits up in the bed, staring pensively, lost in her thoughts. Upbeat jazz begins to play and the film cuts to: The facade of Mount Sinai Hospital. A few cars whiz by as the film moves inside, to various scenes depicting Mickey's comprehensive exam. First is a hearing test, and the movie cuts to a darkened hearing-test room. A light goes on, revealing a slouched-over Mickey sitting in a glass booth. He is wearing a set of headphones. The camera moves back, revealing a technician at the console on the other side of the booth. Mickey signals with his finger when he hears a sound on his headset. Next is an electronystagmography (ENG). Graph paper rolls out of a machine, and after a brief glimpse of the rolling paper, the camera moves over to show Mickey lying terrified, without his glasses, on a couch, with electrodes stuck all over his head. The film then cuts to a BSER test room, where Mickey, sitting in a corner chair, wears another set of headphones. An electrode is attached to his forehead; a nearby technician sits at a computer video screen, looking at a monitoring graph. Last but not least is the tomography. Over the shoulders of a technician in a booth, a large window displays a huge, white rotating machine. The camera moves down the giant cranelike device to reveal Mickey, once again lying down, this time on a table, his eyes closed, underneath it. A sitting Dr. Grey, his back to the camera, is examining a group of X-rays clipped to the light board behind his desk. The doctor turns his chair around to face a tense Mickey sitting on the other side of his desk.",
    "543": "Henry has clearly been concentrating entirely on the vase. He is examining the broken end carefully. Henry throws the vase against the wall where it shatters. Indy steps to the door and stands, listening. Henry slides his umbrella through the straps of his bag. Indy nods. Henry laughs genuinely, believing himself to be laughing at the expense of the S.S. Officer. He's so pissed off, he literally rips a machine gun from the hands of one of the startled soldiers. He turns and sprays the room with machine gun fire, cutting all three Nazis to ribbons and blowing them backwards across the room. Henry looks shocked and horrified. Indy grabs him and pushes him ahead. Indy leads Henry down the hallway as he searches for Elsa. He opens a door and enters. Indy and Henry rush back into the room where Elsa had been left, only to find: a Nazi Colonel holding Elsa hostage. He looks at Elsa, then back to his father. Everyone is yelling at once. Vogel jams the barrel of the Luger painfully into Elsa's neck. Elsa screams. He drops the machine gun to the table and it slides across, shattering glass. Vogel releases his grip on Elsa and shoves her toward Indy. She is propelled directly into his arms. He holds her tightly. Her hand slips into his coat pocket and removes the Grail Diary. She steps back next to Vogel. Indy is stunned. A large baronial room decorated with ancient tapestries and suits of armor. Indy and Henry are ushered in, hands tied behind back, accompanied by Vogel and Elsa and two Nazi guards. Elsa crosses the room toward a high-backed chair facing the fireplace. Indy and Henry do not have the advantage of seeing who is sitting in that chair. They only see a hand reach out. He looks at Henry with surprise. The man in the chair gets to his feet and turns, revealing himself to be Walter Donovan. Donovan smiles benignly and flips through the Grail Diary. Elsa rushes to Donovan's side. She takes the Grail Diary from him. Elsa takes a look for herself -- then glances up at Indy. Brody disembarks from the train along with the other passengers, a cross-section of Arabs and Tusks. A man in the crowd holds out a cup of water to Brody. Brody continues through the crowd past various street vendors. A woman holds a chicken out to him. The woman walks away, leaving Brody alone in the crowd. Sallah shoulders his way through the mob toward Brody. They meet and hug, then begin to walk. Brody searches in his coat pocket for the map as a sinister man approaches. Brody puts the map back in his pocket.",
    "547": "Henry turns and grips the MOUNTED MACHINE GUN with a perplexed expression. Henry pulls out his watch. Indy uses his arm to demonstrate that he's referring to a direction and not a time. Henry does -- and the EXPLODING GUN nearly shakes him out of his seat. Henry has one of the Messerschmidts in his sight. He pulls back on the trigger -- RATTA-A-TAT-TAT! RATTA-A-TAT-TAT! The Messerschmidt banks to the left, but Henry keeps it in his gun sight. Henry swings the gun around, inadvertently. Indy looks back at the missing tail section, then at his father. The plane begins to go down. Indy struggles to control its descent. The wheels of the plane touch down. OUT OF CONTROL, the PLANE SKIDS and CRASHES first into a corral of goats and then into the farmhouse beyond sending a cloud of dust into the air. As Indy pulls himself from the cockpit. Guns BLAZING. As BULLETS EXPLODE around them, Indy and Henry jump over a stone barricade. Henry, frightened, grabs at Indy. An OLD MAN kneels at his car repairing a rear tire. The Man turns to the wheel, the hubcap in his hands. Suddenly the wheel moves forward, startling the Old Man. Indy has the throttle down, both hands tightly gripping the steering wheel. Henry is a very nervous passenger. Indy sees a LOW-FLYING MESSERSCHMIDT coming up behind him in the SIDE MIRROR. As the Messerschmidt ROARS by overhead, BULLETS EXPLODE around them, narrowly missing the car. The car races toward a TUNNEL that cuts through a steep. The Messerschmidt bears down on Indy's car, machine guns. The car ENTERS the tunnel. The Messerschmidt cannot pull up in time. It SLAMS into the MOUTH OF THE TUNNEL, SHEARING OFF its WINGS. The FLAMING FUSELAGE continues to ROCKET through the tunnel like a bullet down the muzzle of a gun. SPARKS fly as its belly SCRAPES against the pavement and the sides of the tunnel. Indy and Henry look over their shoulders to see this wingless BALL OF FIRE gaining on them; about to overtake them. The car exits the tunnel at top speed and veers off the road. The flaming Messerschmidt fuselage shoots past and EXPLODES in the middle of the road. As the car emerges safely from the flames, Henry wipes the sweat from his brow. Henry looks out the windshield and sees the second Messerschmidt SCREAMING out of the sky toward them. The MESSERSCHMIDT drops its single UNDER-FUSELAGE BOMB. It EXPLODES in the road directly ahead of the car, missing it by only several feet. FALLS INTO THE HOLE made by the bomb. Indy climbs out of the car, still in the bomb crater. He turns back to Henry.",
    "549": "Elsa and Donovan take cover beside the parked car. Indy and Henry, followed by Sallah, take cover behind a rock to watch Kazim's Men and the Nazi Troops exchanging fire below them. The BRETHREN are firing at the Donovan party and are being fired on by the Donovan party. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS throw HAND GRENADES into the cliffs. They EXPLODE, killing one of Kazim's Brethren. The battle continues -- a fierce exchange of GUNSHOTS, GRENADES and MACHINE GUN FIRE with losses on both sides. Crouch behind a rock watching as men on both sides of the battle run amongst camels and horses. They look down at Kazim who lies mortally wounded on the ground at their feet. Elsa looks saddened. Kazim dies. Leaps atop a TURKISH SOLDIER on horseback, pulling the man and the horse to the ground. A SECOND TURK comes to assist his comrade; Indy mounts the horse, knocking both Turks to the ground. Brody has been left alone in the tank. Henry climbs down into the tank and taps Brody on the shoulder, startling him. Now Brody tugs his ears, flaps his arms and touches his head. They exchange a handshake. The Nazi Soldiers point their guns at Henry and Brody. Vogel removes a glove and slaps Henry with it. He slaps Henry again. Another slap. Vogel reaches out to slap Henry yet again, but Henry grabs his arm, stopping him. Donovan appears at the turret cover. Indy and Sallah charge forward leading their horses and camels. Then Vogel commands the Tank Driver to give chase. Vogel shouts to the Tank Driver. Henry and Brody still held at gunpoint by the Nazi Soldier. The Nazi Soldier swings his fist, knocking Henry off his seat. Smoke pours from the top of the tank as the turret pops open. Vogel emerges and aims his gun at Indy. Indy and Vogel EXCHANGE SHOTS as Indy chases the tank on his horse. Indy pulls the trigger again -- his gun is empty! Indy immediately takes the high trail. Now Indy is above the tank twelve feet on a paralleling trail. He moves out of the saddle and leaps from the speeding horse onto the trundling tank. Hate-staring at Indy. Hate-staring back at Vogel. Suddenly, from nowhere a German soldier flies INTO FRAME, tackling Indy. One of the two troop carriers is paralleling the tank and like pirates boarding a galleon, Nazi Soldiers leap over the treads and are swarming all over Indy. Indy presses the Luger against his assailant and forces the Nazi to squeeze off a shot into himself. The bullet not only passes through the Nazi, but passes through two other Nazis standing directly behind him on the crowded tank top and three bodies fall away, leaving Indy to stare at the gun in disbelief.",
    "55": "There is a small sign giving the name of the place in elegant neon scroll. It sits on the rolling green lawns. Evelyn's car pulls up before the elegant Spanish rest home, its entryway illuminated by streetlights. Gittes gets out of the car with Evelyn. He offers her his arm and they go up the walkway to the entrance. Gittes and Evelyn are approached by an unctuous man in his forties, with a flower in his buttonhole. He sees Evelyn first. Then he gets a clear look at Gittes, bruised, trousers torn, etc. Evelyn shakes her head. Evelyn can't quite conceal her surprise at the question. Evelyn stares back at Gittes, amused and appalled. She manages to nod. Gittes locks eyes with Palmer. Gittes points to the wall. After Evelyn looks, she turns to Gittes. Gittes strolls toward the women knitting and working on the quilt. Two of the ladies giggle. The third gives them a curt look and goes back to her knitting. Gittes approaches her. Gittes looks at the quilt. In it is the head of a fish among the rest of the crazy quilt pattern. Gittes spots it. Evelyn is beside him. She gestures as if there's someone behind Palmer. Gittes looks up, sees Palmer standing in the doorway, looking taut and a little drawn. Mulvihill has walked up beside Gittes. He makes the mistake of opening the glass door in the entryway, putting his back to Gittes for a moment. Gittes swiftly pulls Mulvihill's jacket up over his head. He spins him around. With his jacket covering his face, Gittes hammers away at Mulvihill, beating him against the glass door, along the wall, mercilessly pounding his fists into the cloth until the cloth turns red and Mulvihill begins to sink to the red tile floor. Mulvihill's gun has clattered to the floor. Gittes jumps in and she takes off across the lawn, tilting the elegant little neon sign on the lawn as she goes. Evelyn looking straight ahead, driving. After a moment she takes one hand off the wheel and rubs her left eye a little. Gittes watches her. Gittes stands on the veranda, smoking a cigarette, staring off into the night. Gittes turns. Evelyn comes out to the veranda, carrying a tray with whiskey and an ice bucket on it. They drink. Gittes looks sharply at her. Then: She looks at him. They're very close now as she's going over a mouse very near his eye. VIEW SHIFTS AGAIN TO INCLUDE Gittes in bed, watching Evelyn next to him as she's talking on the phone. Gittes stares at her silently. She kisses him, rushes to the bathroom, shuts the door. Gittes stares at it a moment.",
    "553": "Its spectacular Grecian facade is carved directly into the rock. GIANT COLUMNS define the Temple's perimeter. The Turk stands alone in the center of the Temple. He's walking slowly. Indy, Sallah, Henry and Brody creep forward to see. Watch him from a safe distance. Is about to approach the spot where a TURKISH SOLDIER LIES DEAD. We don't notice it right away, but the dead soldier has been DECAPITATED. The Turk stops -- only one step away from the beheaded soldier. Takes one more step -- a fatal step, it turns out. Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah react to the sight. She looks at him, horrified. TWO NAZI SOLDIERS force another Turk forward. Everyone turns to discover Indy and his party surrounded by NAZI SOLDIERS. Indy's group are relieved of their guns. Indy, Henry, Brody and Sallah are brought forward by the Nazi Soldiers. Indy laughs. Then Donovan shifts his aim, just a bit, and SHOOTS Henry. The bullet enters his side below the ribs. Henry collapses. Blood flowing from the wound. Brody and Sallah rush to his assistance. Indy spins toward Donovan with murder in his eyes. Donovan points the gun at him. The two decapitated men lie a few yards in front of him. He walks to the entranceway, flanked by two stone lions. We get silent reaction shots -- Elsa -- Sallah -- Brody -- Donovan -- registering their different emotions Indy proceeds forward. His hands open the Grail Diary. Indy takes a few steps forward. Indy stops. He is about to reach the spot where two men have just died. Indy looks at Henry. Indy takes a step forward through the cobwebs. The cobwebs begin to move. Instinctively he ROLLS FORWARD on the ground out of harm's way and looks up. From his new position he is able to see what is causing all the trouble: A RAZOR SHARP TRIPLE. Indy gets cautiously to his feet. Now he sees the pendulum has been guarding a SMALL CORRIDOR which turns a corner to the left fifty yards ahead. Wooden wheels turn -- the mechanism controlling the spinning blades. Indy loops a rope around the wheels, jamming the mechanism and stopping the blades in mid-swipe. Brody and Sallah smile, relieved. Henry shakes his head. Holding the Grail Diary, reading once again, his fedora now covered in cobwebs. Indy pulls away some cobwebs to reveal a cobblestone path. Each cobble is engraved with a letter. Lifts his head painfully. Still lies in Sallah's arms. Indy takes a step and immediately a stone breaks away and Indy falls up to his hip -- his leg stuck through the hold where the stone once was. Who grunts as he pulls himself from the hole, the Grail Diary in his hand.",
    "554": "Now we see each letter on the stones as Indy carefully walks forward. Donovan and Elsa follow in his footsteps. Indy sighs with relief and steps forward. Indy stands in a small opening, just small enough for his shoulders to squeeze through and beyond that a 100 foot drop to the rocks below and 100 feet across, nothing but a rough, stony cliff wall. He can see nowhere to cross. He looks again to the Grail Diary. Indy looks around and then he notices that inscribed into the rock above his head is the head of a lion. Calls to his son. We see him leap into space. We see that he is in midair. Indy looks around and down and now he figures it out. Ingeniously, the First Crusaders have painted a pathway to align with the rocks 100 feet below. It is a perfect forced perspective image of the rocks below with lines from a hundred feet continuing six feet below his sight line where his feet are stepping. It's painted to blend in with the rocks below. Highly evolved camouflage. In perfect alignment with everything we see below. Indy throws some dirt on the bridge and he crosses it like the first Crusader from the painting over Henry's desk. Indy crawls through a small opening in the side of the cliff and enters a Temple. A vast array of chalices is displayed on the altar of this small Temple. Many sizes, many shapes, some gold, some silver, but they all glitter and shine. And then he realizes that a man is praying at the altar! He has his back turned to Indy. But he is dressed as what he is! A GRAIL KNIGHT. But we can't see the Grail Knight's face. When the Grail Knight sees Indy he gets wearily to his feet and, surprisingly, prepares to give combat. Taking up his two-handed broadsword. He comes at Indy, attempting to swing the huge, heavy sword but finding the effort almost too much. Indy dodges two or three clumsy swings of the sword, making no attempt to fight back. Until the Knight, exhausted, drops the sword and collapses. Indy approaches him and raises the visor and we see that the Knight is a very ancient man. The Grail Knight reaches forward and fingers Indy's clothing. The Grail Knight holds his sword out to Indy. At that moment Donovan and Elsa appear. Donovan turns to face the display of cups. Elsa and Indy exchange looks. Elsa chooses a cup -- a solid gold, emerald encrusted goblet. Donovan instantly takes it from her. Donovan rushes to the well and fills the goblet with water. Donovan drinks from the goblet. Then, Donovan's entire body starts to convulse.",
    "56": "She leaps out of bed, throwing on a robe. Evelyn starts quickly for the bathroom, then comes back and kneels by the side of the bed, takes Gittes' hand. Then leaps out of bed, rummages around, tosses on his trousers. He grabs his shoes, throws them on. Then hurries out of the bedroom. Running across the driveway to the garage. There are two cars there. Mulwray's Buick and Evelyn's Packard. Gittes moves over to the Buick, opens the passenger's door. With the heel of his shoe, he kicks at the right rear taillight of the car. He shatters the red lens, gets up. He carefully pulls the red lens off the taillight, exposing the white light beneath it. He tosses the red lens into the shrubbery and hurries back toward the house. Evelyn's car speeds along the curves on Sunset Boulevard, the red and white lights coming IN AND OUT OF VIEW. Behind the wheel of Mulwray's car, keeping a healthy distance from Evelyn in front of him. Pulls up before a small little bungalow house. She hurries on up the walkway to the front door. He brings the car a few yards further down the street, parking it near Evelyn's. Idles the engine with the lights off. Gittes gets out of the car and goes up the walkway. The curtains are drawn except for one of the small windows on the side of the house. He goes to it and looks, balancing on the edge of the porch. Gittes sees Evelyn's Oriental servant rush through the living room of the small house. Here the windows have blinds. He moves to one where the blind is not completely drawn. There's an inch or so of space at the bottom. Evelyn is pacing back and forth in and out of his line of vision. After a moment someone rises INTO SHOT, obviously from lying on a bed. The figure is just a few feet from Evelyn. Her tear-stained face comes INTO VIEW. Mulwray's girlfriend. Evelyn kneels. She's looking up to Evelyn, speaking in Spanish. Continues to watch. Gittes can see the servant again. In a moment he re-emerges back through the living room carrying a tray with a glass and pitcher on it. She insists that the girl swallow down some pills. The girl reluctantly does. Emerges from the house, goes to her car and gets in. Evelyn sees Gittes sitting in her car, staring coldly at her. Gittes starts to get out of the car. Evelyn grabs his arm, nearly screaming. Her intensity actually rips Gittes' already partially torn jacket. He looks at it and her. It seems to have a momentary calming effect on both of them. Evelyn's head sinks onto the steering wheel, her hair covering her face.",
    "562": "She gasps once again, terrified. Indy lifts her and carries Elsa as he moves forward. Kazim and his men step to the opening Indy made earlier and shine their flashlights through to the rat-infested water. More rat-infested water as Elsa, now walking again, follows Indy through another passageway lined with skulls and bones. Indy reaches for a wall to steady himself and inadvertently grabs a skeleton. A bone comes loose in his hand as rats scurry about and leap at him from all directions. He takes a moment to compose himself, then steps across the water to Elsa's side. He steps into the water, then reaches up to help Elsa do the same. The chamber is flooded with black, briny water. They move toward the altar. Indy and Elsa begin to inspect the ornately carved COFFINS like the scholars of antiquity that they are. These are big oak caskets held together by straps of etched brass. One coffin is elevated above the others. Together they begin to push on the lid -- STRAINING and GROANING until it slides away and BANGS against the stone platform. Lie the DECOMPOSED REMAINS of a KNIGHT IN ARMOR. Indy and Elsa look in. Indy unfolds a piece of paper and holds it over the shield. The missing portion of the rubbing is completed by the shield. Indy laughs. As it lights a match. Dropping the lighted match into the oil-slick water. Elsa holds the torch. Indy looks around. And then he sees the GLOW OF FIRELIGHT dancing across the Catacomb walls. This is followed by THOUSANDS OF RATS FLEEING from around the corner of the Narrow Passageway, STAMPEDING toward Elsa and Indy -- SHRIEKING and SQUEALING as they approach. The rats literally wash over them -- like a rodent tidal wave -- in their efforts to escape. Elsa SCREAMS. Indy braces his back against the altar and TOPPLES THE COFFIN with his feet. It CRASHES against the stone platform and SPLASHES into the water. They jump into the water beside the bobbing, overturned coffin. Indy literally DUNKS her and pushes her underneath. Elsa surfaces into the air pocket created by the coffin, SPUTTERING and SPITTING. Now Indy pops up into the air pocket. He looks at Elsa -- they are both soaking wet. Indy disappears under the water and swims out from under the coffin. Indy swims, looking for an escape route. The rats are beginning to force their way inside, swimming through the water and climbing on Elsa, who squirms and screams in terror. Indy pops back up through the water. Elsa groans. They take a deep breath and both dive under the water. The perfect picture postcard -- St. Mark's Square and the Grand Canal beyond.",
    "568": "Edwards is shocked. Edwards pulls his own weapon and points it at Kay's head. Edwards whirls around to see Jeebs' BODY, growing another head. Only takes four or five seconds. Kay raises the weapon again, threatening. Jeebs nods, point taken. Edwards, still dazed by Jeebs' regrown head, glances down at all the weapons. Kay leaves. The flash dims on EDWARDS and KAY, sitting at a table in a Chinese restaurant. Edwards takes the remaining chair. Zed continues addressing the Recruits. They all turn and regard Edwards a little smugly. Edwards's hand is, indeed, up. Then one of the young recruits eagerly raises his hand. Zed calls on him. Edwards tries to stifle a laugh, but can't. Zed looks into the gallery. Most obvious in the frozen tableau of creatures is a lunging, snarling beast, which has three bullet holes in its chest. Next to it is a massively deformed humanoid creature with a large hook for a head, which also has three holes in it. In the back corner of the gallery, there is a single bullet hole in a pretty eight-year-old girl. Zed sighs. Sideways glances from the other recruits. ZED and KAY stand behind smoked glass, staring at the RECRUITS, who are still in the shooting gallery, waiting for a decision. Zed turns and walks away. Kay stares through the glass, at EDWARDS, who stands alone on one side of the room, apart from the rest of the group. Zed reappears on the other side of the glass, coming through a door and into the shooting gallery. The RECRUITS follow ZED out of the shooting gallery and into a long hallway. Zed motions them off to the left. EDWARDS is the last one out of the room, but he stops as he steps into the hallway. KAY is outside the door, waiting for him. Edwards recognizes him from last night. As they pass an alcove, Edwards notices the six other Recruits, who have been herded into a corner. Zed, addressing them, pulls a neuralyzer from his pocket. He holds a neuralyzer up in front of them, and the Recruits stare obediently at it as Zed slips on a pair of black sunglasses. ALIEN SHAPES are visible within. DEE and ZED are there, much younger. Yet another photograph, this one showing a young KAY, in a shirt and tie, holding a bouquet of flowers, staring at the open door of the landed flying saucer. Kay steers Edwards to the right, down another corridor, just as long as the first. Another picture, this one of the 1964 World's Fair grounds, still under construction. Giant models of rockets mark the Fair's theme of space travel; most prominent in the construction are two tall towers, with the flying saucers now mounted at the top of each.",
    "572": "The Orkin van is parked in an alleyway somewhere downtown. From inside, throaty WAILS of frustration can be heard. Inside the van, the ornate rosewood box is now battered and scarred, its various locks holding tight against EDGAR's repeated attempts to claw his way into it. He BELLOWS in rage and hurls the box against the side of the van, where it finally CRACKS a hinge. Inside, there are dozens of precious, glittering diamonds, which he promptly tosses aside as worthless. But the rest of the box is empty. He points up at the screen with a laser pencil. He indicates the three stars that make up the belt. Elizabeth looks up, as if she knows she's being watched, but she's just looking at the sky, wondering how many stars'll be out tonight. It's more than Kay can bear. He reaches out and flicks a switch. Kay clicks off the picture of her. The monitor goes blank, except for a data screen. Jay drags a chair and sits down. Jay and Kay cross back toward the LAD (Landed Alien Display), where each of the thousand or so Aliens who live on earth are represented by a flickering LIGHT. Some lights are starting to go out. Kay looks to his partner, then to the screen. Kay and Jay walk away. Edgar reaches into the front seat of the van and pulls out his twelve gauge. He points it at the tow truck Driver. The tow truck driver looks at him with disdain, and pulling back his shirt reveals a mean-looking gun. There are several PHOTOS OF A CAT on the wall. There is also a pile of BEJEWELED CAT COLLARS. Jay's attention is broken by something through the window. Outside, lumbering straight for the store, is EDGAR. And then Jay FIRES, shattering the storefront window, and BLOWING UP A CAR on the street. The blast hurls him up and back a good ten feet, SLAMMING him into the wall with tremendous force. Edgar turns and rushes away down the street as Jay picks himself up. Jay leaps through the broken storefront window and after Edgar. Kay gestures to a group of ONLOOKERS, drawn by the curious blasts from the store. There's smoking rubble everywhere. After gesturing to the back of the Orkin van, where Edgar's spaceship is neatly stowed, Kay pulls out his cell phone. ZED is in his office. Zed looks down to the vast floor below and sees the four worm guys with suitcases walking across the floor. He looks up at the screen. EDGAR gets out and walks away, fast, CURSING under his breath. He rants, livid, thinking hard. As he passes a newsstand, he grabs the NEWS VENDOR by the collar.",
    "573": "Jay looks down. A voice answers him, but not the Vendor's. The voice is coming from the dog. Kay approaches, motioning to Jay to make sure no one hears. Kay grabs Frank. He yelps like, well, a dog. PASSERBYS glare at Kay, who appears to be seriously mistreating this poor little dog. Jay tries to explain. Kay shakes Frank the Pug, trying to force an answer. Kay shakes Frank the Pug once more. Kay lets go of Frank, turns to Jay, who is lost in thought. Jay suddenly notices Frank the Pug bark at a cat farther down the sidewalk. In the morgue, LAUREL is working at a desk when suddenly ROSENBERG'S CAT leaps up onto it from nowhere, the way cats do, landing right in the middle of the file she's studying. Laurel jumps. She pets the cat. Laurel turns the name tag to face her. As it is written across the collar of the cat. Laurel notices something dangling from the cat's collar -- a CIRCULAR ICON of a strange and beautiful metal. The center is some sort of hardened, translucent material, light green in color. She peers into the jewel, and her face washes over with amazement. It's as if Laurel is sucked into another universe. Her face goes beatifically blank as she sails through a massive starfield, millions of stars, billions of green, verdant planets, all racing by her at the speed of light. From out in the corridor, a bell rings -- DING, DING. Suddenly, quick as a gunfighter, Tony SNAPS the fly swatter down on a BUZZING FLY. Edgar winces. WHACK! Tony flicks the fly swatter again, sending another bug to meet its maker. Edgar grits his teeth. WHACK! Still another fly goes down. Tony looks down, to where Edgar's hands rest on the counter. Half a dozen cockroaches stream out of his sleeve. And he continues into the morgue, leaving Kay waiting outside. LAUREL SLAMS into a wall on one side of the morgue, thrown there by EDGAR. He leans in, close, furious. He grabs her roughly and drags her across the morgue, toward the equipment she pointed to. As they draw close, ORION the cat bolts from underneath it, races between their legs, and leapfrogs over several small cabinets, landing on top of a very tall one with only six inches clearance between it and the ceiling. Edgar just starts to turn when they hear the BELL and a VOICE from the corridor outside. Jay looks at her. Jay just looks at her, amazed at the power he seems to have over this woman. She seems irritated with him, but it doesn't go with what she's saying. Laurel rolls her eyes. She looks down, pointedly, in the direction of her waist.",
    "574": "Parrish blinks, has he heard something, has he not, he is not sure, he releases his arm, his grimace of pain fades, the discomfort seems momentarily to have subsided. It is unmistakably a Voice, it is not the wind, Parrish has heard something, he looks around, but no one is there. He can't finish peeing, turns back to his bedroom. All beweildered, Parrish looks around once more, climbs back into bed, trying to trace the source of what he has heard or hasn't heard; he is not sure. He pulls the covers up now, not a SOUND, tries to close his eyes. Parrish sits up again, frightened, but still there is no one there, he seems fraught with indecision, should he get up, should he not, what is happening? Parrish closes his eyes but then they flutter open, he glances up at the ceiling and finally, exhausted, falls back asleep. The great lawn infested with workmen, planting stakes, un-rolling a huge canvas tent, gardeners fashioning topiary and adding landscaping of their own, crews setting up platforms, speakers, lights. Ubiquitous is ALLISON, 35, Parrish's older daughter, foremen competing for her attention and she relishing every moment. A Painter approaches. Parrish, groomed for the day, trots down the stairs, observing the activity outside through the windows. Parrish grins, continues on, is intercepted by Allison who, on catching sight of him, bounces in from the terrace. But Parrish only pours coffee. Parrish gazes at the going-on outside which are increasing in intensity. Allison goes, Susan observes Parrish fidgeting. The helicopter CHOPS in overhead. A BUTLER and May carry the overnight bags for the family as led by Parrish, they hurry towards the helicopter. Drew kisses her, over her shoulder he glances at Parrish. Quince comes running up now. Drew ushers everybody on, first Parrish, then Susan and Quince, Drew the last to climb on, shuts the door behind him as Allison hurries away from the whirling rotors. He smiles. The Young Man hangs up, turns around and sits down to an overflowing plate of eggs and meat, potatoes and toast, the counterman refills his cup and the Young Man ties into the breakfast, eating it with such relish that Susan can't take her eyes off him. He senses her eyes, glances over, his cheeks filled with a mouthful of food, swallows embarrassedly. Susan laughs. The Young Man smiles. Susan looks into her coffee. Drew is still at Parrish's heels, but now Parrish stops at the open door, turns back to him, reminding Drew that this is as far as he goes without being invited. Parrish disappears into his office. Drew, on his way out, glides past Jennifer's desk. Leaning against the back of the couch, he stares out through floor-to-ceiling windows, surveying the Manhattan skyline: cogitates.",
    "575": "He takes a seat on the couch, opens a folder, suddenly he flinches with a spasm of pain in his shoulder. It is sharp but brief, he notices it but what it does not continue, he ignores it. Parrish resumes looking at the folder when suddenly the pain comes again. Frozen with surprise, Parrish's eyes search the room for the source of the SOUND, it comes from no particular direction, yet surrounds him. Suddenly Parrish's symptoms sharply intensify, he is sinking to the floor but somehow grabs a corner of the desk, holds on with one hand, with the other clutches at his shoulder and arm, the pain has violently seized the upper part of his body. Parrish grips the edge of the desk, the pain assaulting him on the one hand, the Voice coming at him from the outer, each aberration feeds on the other, he is beside himself, consumed with pain and bewildered by what seems to be a hallucination but which he is certain is not. Parrish is possessed. Parrish gasps. He holds on tight to the corner of the desk, sweat dripping, his skin ashen. Susan at the door now, pauses abruptly, her eyes on the Young Man. The Young Man holds the door for Susan as they step out onto the street. Susan is staring at him now, he smiles, all open and vulnerable. Parrish ignores her, his attention has been taken by the Voice. His eyelids flutter, nonplused, edgy and fearful. Parrish is confounded. Blindly and disconcerted, he follows Allison and Drew and Quince. Parrish sits. Parrish is on the edge of his seat, struggling to hide his panic. The conversation swirls on around Parrish, he is deaf to it. Parrish is in shock, still striving to gain control of himself. As Coyle serves him, Parrish turns to Luisa. Parrish is stunned. Parrish, spinning with anxiety, tries to summon up his courage to go as Allison continues. Finally Parrish rises from the table, starts out. Allison is about to press the point, but then drifts into disappointed silence as Parrish leaves the room. Parrish moves deliberately down the hall, slows as he nears the doorway to the library. The door is open. He hesitates before he crosses the threshold, taking in as much as his eye can see, now tentatively, he enters. A beautiful, classic room, areas of dim, warm light, club chairs, books reaching to the ceiling, a rolling library ladder, a weathered dictionary on a stand, a model boat carved of bone set into the stacks which are separated from the reading area by a seven-foot high partition of obscured glass. Parrish, poised in the doorway, looks around, nothing in sight. Parrish is startled, he shrinks backward for a moment, his eyes searching the room for the Voice, the timbre and pitch of which is exactly what he has heard before.",
    "576": "Now a flicker of a shadow from behind a corner of the obscured glass, the section of the room most distant from Parrish, there is a shape. Something is there. Parrish falls silent, something in the SOUND and TONE of the Voice muting him. He takes a step backwards. Parrish struggles to make sense of what he is hearing. After a moment. The figure who is the Voice takes a step forward now, no longer obscured by the glass he comes into the light, revealing himself to be the Young Man seen previously in the coffee shop, but there is a change; he seems odd, offcenter, not handsome but terrifyingly beautiful. A moment, Parrish beside himself. The Young Man steps closer to Parrish, his face is inches from a shaking, sweating Parrish's face, the Young Man daring Parrish to identify him. Parrish turns away. But the Young Man, spectacularly, is in front of him again. Parrish is shocked, stunned, terrified at the word, by what he has comprehended. He surveys the Young Man who, at this moment, actually seems bewildered by his effect. A hopelessly confused Parrish does not respond for a moment. A SOUND at the door. Parrish ignores her at first, finally he looks at Luisa then at the Young Man, then once more at both of them as if to verify the Young Man's presence has been acknowledged by Luisa. Luisa nods perfunctorily and exits. Parrish is frozen, dumbfounded. Parrish is frightened by the response. Parrish hesitates, then obediently leads the Young Man out of the library, down a long hallway and across the foyer. As Parrish and the Young Man enter, Allison is heard in the background. Parrish and the Young Man appear at the table, an awkward pause ensues, the unannounced guest's presence at a family dinner being noted, and the guest himself carefully surveyed. Parrish is horribly uncomfortable as the Young Man looks at each person as if he were discovering a face for the first time. Parrish drifts into another awkward pause. The group waits patiently. Parrish's face reveals a desperate searching for a last name, a furtive glance at Joe. Parrish's brow darkens and a name tumbles from his lips. Luisa has set a plate in front of Joe, and Parrish's, which was taken to the kitchen to be warmed, has been returned. Joe looks over at the other guests, then picks up his utensils gingerly, strives to copy the others, stops, staring at his food. Parrish falls silent again, looking for an answer. She kisses Drew in some light, humorous way they have obviously done before, their heads bobbing like plastic water toys and their lips meeting mid-air. At the kiss's conclusion Susan suddenly notices Joe is present and has been watching.",
    "578": "Everyone sits when Parrish does but Joe, right at home, spots a tray of refreshments: coffee, pastries, he heads for them. Immediately indications of surprise on Board members' faces at Parrish bringing in an 'observer', Drew's reaction guarded but intense. Drew indicates to the Board's Stenographer to arrange Joe's refreshments. Joe interjects. After a moment. Drew regards Joe. The Board is provoked and mystified by Joe and even more by his presence, they cast meaningful glances at Parrish, Drew coolly grasps the irritation of the members. But Joe doesn't move. Joe stares at the money as Parrish shows him the door. Joe goes. Susan is busy giving instructions to a Nurse, a patient on an examining table beside them. As she finishes, she suddenly notices Joe down the corridor in the reception area. She is startled for the moment, quickly makes a last notation, hands a chart to the Nurse and heads down the corridor. Susan regards him. Visible now behind them are a Caribbean woman in her mid-thirties, TEENA, an arm around her mother, EASTER, who is holding her stomach and rocking back and forth in her seat, in great pain. Easter looks up and sees Joe. She abruptly becomes still, eyes wide, as if sudden recognition. But Easter just stares at Joe, fearful. Joe looks at Easter, curiously. Joe regards Easter, a long moment. Joe shakes his head, a firm no. But when he looks and speaks to Easter again, it is with concern and even regret. She does, her pained grimace melts into a peaceful smile. He takes his hand away, and the Orderly wheels Easter off. Teena goes. Susan regards Joe, puzzled. Joe shifts. Another awkward silence. Susan smiles gently. Another moment. Joe is more abstracted than usual, he is staring at Parrish's food. Joe takes another big bite. Silence, Parrish getting lost in his memories. Joe is riveted on Parrish now, Parrish aware of him, has paused. A KNOCK, the door opens and Drew enters, looks at Parrish, then at Joe, stands poised in the doorway. Drew takes a moment, then plunges in. Drew is stunned. Drew heads for the door, turns around. Allison and Susan together by a piano; Parrish, Quince and a distracted Joe are gathered near the terrace. Quince sees Parrish hesitate. An excited Quince drains his drink and heads for Drew as Allison appears. An awkward pause. Allison elbows him. Silence, everyone waiting for Parrish to proceed. He sits, then immediately stands up again. Coyle heads for the kitchen. Joe is locked on Susan, it is as if there is nobody else in the room. Parrish regards Joe, then Susan, his face reflects a sudden concern with their relationship.",
    "579": "Silence, Parrish is at a loss. Susan's directness has caught him by surprise, Joe blinks. Joe remains silent, rendered extremely anxious by Susan's inquiries. Susan comes closer to Joe. Joe tries to respond but he can't, his stammer interrupted by Susan. They are inches apart now, the smell of each other surrounds them, a heaviness to the moment, now Joe turns to head up the stairs. He excuses himself with an ineffable gesture, now climbs the stairs, Susan watches him disappear. Susan is left alone now with Parrish who is fixing a drink at a sidebar. She kisses him. She goes. The Board of Parrish Communications is gathered, absent are Parrish and Quince. Drew leans over to Felicia, speaks quietly and she leaves the room. The door opens and Felicia enters followed by Quince, surprised at seeing a convened Board, but still he is all smiles. Quince hesitates, then realizes what Drew has on his mind. He nods confidently to Drew, then turns importantly to the Board. She bursts into tears all over again. A sense of foreboding falls over Joe's face, his fear that he is passing through some barrier, a point of no return. The apprehensive expression on Joe's face fades away. Parrish and Joe enter, the entire Board is assembled, including Drew, Quince and Sloane. Drew gets the message, at the same time Joe is checking out all the attendees, his eyes come to rest on Drew. A moment as Parrish looks around, the moment extends, it appears he may not ever answer. Parrish is expressionless. Joe's eyes are riveted on Drew. Joe follows Parrish out of the room. Sloane has pursued Parrish and Joe. The elevator door opens, Parrish and Joe step inside and the door closes, leaving Sloane behind. The Board meeting has broken up, clusters of members have lingered, exchanging post-mortems. An enraged Quince has cornered Drew, out of earshot of the others. Quince falls silent, aquiver with this reality. Quince is struck dumb. Her head nestles underneath his arm, she has a sense of his comforting her without knowing that he is doing so. She laughs at the earnestness with which he answers. Joe seems to drift away now, they lie together as one but for the first time, she feels separate from him, sensing him gone to some distant, distant land. She smiles. Joe and Susan are at the front door, he has helped her on with her coat, she turns around, they kiss. The kiss lingers, Susan breaks away, reaches for the door, looks back longingly at Joe and then she is gone, Joe closing the door softly after her. He turns back into the foyer, looks up, Parrish is on the balcony, it is clear he has observed Joe and Susan.",
    "58": "Gittes takes a deep breath. It yawns AT CAMERA, only a trickle of water dropping into the ocean. VIEW WIDENS TO INCLUDE Escobar, Gittes, and two Plain clothesmen, standing and staring at the empty pipe as if they expect it to talk. A THIRD ASSISTANT runs down the side of the cliff and Over to Escobar. Escobar turns to Gittes. Stares at him for a long moment. Escobar stares hatefully at Gittes. Escobar steps between the two. He rings the doorbell. Scarcely waiting for an answer he tries it. It's locked. He reaches into his pocket pulls out his cigarette case, takes a pick out of the side and starts to fool with the lock. The Maid opens the door abruptly, stares in some surprise at Gittes. Gittes in Mulwray's Buick whips into the driveway. Gittes pushes past him. She takes Gittes' arm. Evelyn, looking a little worn but glad to see him hurries to the door. She looks at him, searching his face. Gittes is looking around it. Gittes continues to look around. He sees clothes laid out for packing in a bedroom off the living room. He goes to the phone and dials. Gittes looks at her, then takes the handkerchief out of his breast pocket. Unfolds it on a coffee table, revealing the bifocal glasses, one lens still intact. Evelyn stares dumbly at them. gets up, shakes her. Evelyn is trembling. Gittes stares at her. He's been charged with anger and when Evelyn says this it explodes. Gittes smiles. He hits her full in the face. Evelyn stares back at him. The blow has forced tears from her eyes, but she makes no move, not even to defend herself. Gittes slaps her again. Gittes slaps her again. He hits her again. He belts her finally, knocking her into a cheap Chinese vase which shatters and she collapses on the sofa, sobbing. Kyo comes running down the stairs. Kyo turns after staring at Gittes for a moment then goes back upstairs. She nods. Then he follows her gaze to the glasses lying on his handkerchief. Gittes picks up the glasses, stares at the lens, is momentarily lost in them. From the stairs. She has her arm around Katherine. With her arm around the girl, talking in Spanish, Evelyn hurries her toward the bedroom. In a moment she re-emerges. He nods slowly. Gittes hangs up and goes to the door. He opens it. Escobar and his minions appear from either side of the door. A steep hill overlooks part of the harbor. Escobar's unmarked car pulls up to a stop in front of a Spanish duplex perched on the steep hillside. Escobar shakes his head. Gittes gets out of the car, glances around, goes up the stairs.",
    "581": "He heads towards her, they are somehow situated as if they were alone in this crowd. Susan is in pain now, she can't summon an answer. They regard each other, a long pause, they have reached an understanding. He takes her in his arms and they dance away. On a distant fringe of the party, a grass terrace that still commands a view of the dance floor, is Joe. His eyes are on Parrish and Susan, he watches them admiringly yet ruefully. A Waiter passes, catches sight of Joe, stops. Joe regards the Waiter for a moment. The Waiter hesitates. The Waiter moves off. Joe's attention returns to Parrish and Susan, the dance number ends, a BOOM. On the dance floor. Parrish looks up, sees Joe up on the terrace, waiting. Suddenly he hugs her, holds her very close. She looks at him, he smiles, nods, but doesn't release her until she smiles back. Now she heads out with the crowd for the fireworks. When Parrish senses she is on her way, he turns and heads up towards Joe. Joe rises to meet Parrish as he approaches. They watch the guests gathering to view the fireworks. Joe waits. Joe regards Parrish, waits until he has a sense that Parrish has accepted what Joe has said, then Joe continues. Parrish waits. Parrish smiles faintly, takes a deep breath, he strides out again, Joe right with him. In tandem they continue on and disappear over the crest of the hill. A barrage of fireworks lights up the sky. Down below, Susan, in a pained reflex, again turns and looks up towards the hill. She hesitates, now glides away from the party, her step quickens as she walks up towards the hill. Susan halts, in the distance a figure is approaching from over the crest of the hill where Joe and Parrish disappeared. He is heading straight for her, she tries to make him out, seems to recognize him, starts to walk towards him as if pulled by a magnet. Now she stops again. It is a man, he keeps coming, and now that he is close and recognizes him. Something about him makes Susan slightly tentative. Joe shrugs, scratches his head endearingly, uncertain of time and place. Some realization is dawning on Susan, it renders her lightheaded. Susan regards Joe intently, searching his face for an answer. Susan holds herself very still. She searches the Young Man's eyes, his face is open, completely vulnerable, waiting for her response. A long silence, the words come out haltingly. Susan signs, the Young Man smiles gently, they are completely intent on each other. Susan smiles, the fireworks finale goes off, the MUSIC comes up from below, the night fills with light.",
    "582": "A plane takes off from Orlando International Airport amid heavy clouds. In a room, a digital clock on a bedside table reads 7.13. It turns to 7.14. A naked dark haired woman with her hair falling around her shoulders, sits up on a bed. She gets off the bed. There's a naked man sleeping on his stomach wakes up. The woman takes a purse and walks out of the room as the man picks up a cell phone. He sits up in bed. He drinks from an almost entry beer bottle. And watches the shapely woman as she reenters the room. The woman picks out some clothes. She slips on a thong. The man lights a cigarette. The woman lights a joint. The man lies on his back. The woman climbs on the bed. She straddles the man. She puts the joint to his lips. She gets off the bed. He smokes a cigarette. He sits up and snorts a line of cocaine. The man walks out of the room dressed in a black suit and sporting dark glasses under a pilot's cap. An airplane pin is on his lapel. People run across the tarmac as rain lashes the airport. Lightening flashes in the distance. The man now in a raincoat walks under a parked south jet airplane. He pauses near one of the wheels. Opens his mouth and sprays some mouth freshener. He trots to the mobile stairway leading to the passenger walkway and slips on the first step. He joins the passengers through a side door. Whitaker sits next to his co-pilot. Whip inhales the oxygen. Whip fidgets on his side of the cockpit. Ken watches as Whip brushes his hair. A woman steps out of her room at Hotel Atlanta. Carrying up a folded-up massage table. She wears a dress and has a small tattoo on her shoulder. She pulls some bills from a bundle of cash. She walks to a car and places the massage table in the trunk. She smokes as she makes a call from the driver's seat. She leans on the steering wheel and lowers the phone to the passenger seat. A man snorts coke. He looks Nicole over. Brad drops his towel. He holds a small square. Margaret sits, facing Trina. Whip pushes the side-stick forward. The cockpit shakes. Whip takes the yoke and pulls back. They ascend. The plane shakes and the items fall from overhead bins. Ken casts an uneasy sideways glance at Whip. With eyes on the horizon, as he steers the plane through rough air. He moves the side-stick forward. The altimeter slides quickly to the right as the plane rises. They reach a clearing through clouds and bright sunlight as Whip levels out.",
    "587": "A cassette labeled Soul Funk number two plays on the stereo as Whip lies back with a pack of ice on his knee. He picks up a glass of whiskey as Nicole, fresh from taking a shower, exits the bathroom. She picks up a cushion. Carrying the pillow, she walks to Whip. Kneels down beside him and removes the ice pack from his knee. She lifts his leg and places the cushion under it. She massages his knee. Whip is laid back in the armchair watching as Nicole's hands move up to cover his hand. He raises the glass as if to take a drink, but stops midway. Nicole hesitates, her gaze steady on him. She takes the glass from his hand and sets it carefully on the nearby table. She pushes herself towards him and they kiss. They look into each other's eyes and their lips meet again. The next morning Whip watches Nicole as she briefly stirs in her sleep. Whip looks up and rises off the bed. Outside, Hugh gets out of a car. Whip steps onto the veranda holding his cane and a gun. Hugh partially raises his hands. Hugh and Whip climb a platform near the church. A small congregation listens to a sermon in a cordoned off area. Hugh takes a pair of binoculars and watches a woman step out of a black SUV. Whip watches as reporters and officials wander around the wreckage. Whip clenches his jaw. Carr stands at the far end of the large conference table opposite Charlie. Carr pushes through the double glass doors and walks towards Whip, who stands. Whip forces a smile. Whip drinks straight from a whiskey bottle. He watches a home video of his father and son playing football. Nicole walks in the door. Nicole watches him. He increases the volume on the TV. Nicole has not moved since she walked in. She watches Whip try to stand, and then, fall. He lies prone on the carpet. Nicole covers her mouth with her hand. Whip has passed out. Nicole removes the cigarette from his fingers. And adjusts his head so he can breathe easily. Nicole covers Whip with a blanket. Then, turns off the video and switches off the light. Nicole sits in a chair on the veranda taking pictures. Whip steps out in a bathrobe. He ambles toward her. He sits in a rocking chair. He smiles at her. He places a cigarette in his mouth and picks up her camera. He picks up a book from the coffee table between them. He points to some open land. Nicole puffs on her cigarette. She nods. Whip points the camera at her. At a church, a large framed picture of Katerina stands surrounded by flowers as a coffin is carried out.",
    "589": "He reads the letter using the light from a nearby window. He picks up the bottle and throws it hard across the room. It explodes against the hanging photo of his son, which stares at it motionless. Rain falls steadily as Whip sits in the car and pours alcohol into a bottle of juice and takes a drink. He exits the car and enters a large hangar. The crashed South Jet Aircraft stands almost completely assembled with parts strewn around beside it. Cabinets and shelves lining one side of a building. Hugh follows Charlie out of the plane. Whip cocks his head. Hugh turns and walks away. Whip speeds down the mud road, splashing slush to the side. He brakes when he sees news crews outside the farm house. Some reporters spot him, he reverses and drives back onto the main road. He stops opposite a house in a quiet neighborhood. Pulling up on a curb barely missing a fire hydrant. He chugs on the bottle of juice. He steps out of the car and walks up a foot path to a house. A man watches Whip from a parked car and speaks into his cell phone. Whip's ex-wife opens the door. Her smile fades. Whip hugs the struggling Will. Whip turns off the news. Whip lifts his arms. Whip walks down a hotel corridor with Charlie holding a can Coca-cola. They approached a burly man. Hugh emerges from a room. Whip enters the room. They shake hands. They hug. Whip looks around the spacious room. He picks up a can of Coke and goes over to the fridge. He finds it stocked with juices and nonalcoholic beverages. Later, he eats a meal alone in his room. He lies in bed surfing channels on the TV. He shaves. He tries to open the thick file Hugh left for him, and it spreads like an accordion. He abandons it. He sits over the toilet smoking as the bath fills. The clock shows 2.08 AM as he hangs a suit in a wardrobe. He looks around for the source of the knocking. Lying in bed he's awakened by the same sound. He gets out of bed and goes to a side door. He holds his ear to it, then pulls it open. The extended lock on a door leading to an adjoining room bumps repeatedly against the doorjamb. Whip enters the room. A gentle breeze blows through the balcony doors ruffling drawn curtains. Whip walks over and gazes at the skyline. A plane's beacon lights flash in the night sky. Whip turns around and his eyes fall on a fridge. He opens the door to reveal rows of miniature bottles of alcohol on the shelves.",
    "591": "Lightning flashes behind it, as it moves forward. A human eye. Harry Potter's bloodied face. A host of press photographers flash their cameras repeatedly at the dazed looking Harry and a tall, white-haired old man with a long white beard, Professor Dumbledore. He puts his left arm protectively around Harry's shoulder, and steers him through the crowd. Dumbledore wears two rings on his left hand. Reflected in the glass of a tall office building, the brooding storm clouds settle over the City of London. The staff on one of the upper floors gather at the windows, and look out in alarm, as the menacing clouds drift ever closer. Lightening flashes behind the clouds. They billow forward in the shape of a skull, from which three dark trails of smoke appear. They swoop through the clouds, down towards the Thames, then across Trafalgar Square. They sweep up Charing Cross Road, moving swiftly past Leicester Square tube station. Traveling down narrow alleys, back streets, and through solid walls, they hurtle into Diagon Alley, where they swoop into a shop. It bursts into flames. People lie injured, as the Death Eaters emerge from the shop, one holding a man with a bag over his head. Two wear metal masks. The third has a long, thin face and a beard. They zoom away, and weave over and under the Millennium Bridge. It tilts and sways, flinging people against the parapets. They cling on, desperately. Steel supports are ripped away. Those on the undulating bridge run in panic. The remaining supports give way, and the bridge crashes into the murky waters of the Thames. The three trails of smoke rise from the river, and cross each other in a blur. Surbiton Railway Station. A pretty waitress. He puts down the paper. She smiles at him, starts to walk away. He spins round. Harry smiles at the waitress. As she goes, he cups his hand over his mouth. He sniffs his breath, then pops a mint in his mouth. A train flashes through the station. Harry slowly rises and walks to a window. A light flickers on the platform opposite. He uses his sleeve to wipe condensation from the glass. Another train passes. Harry's eyes are fixed on the opposite platform. As the train disappears, he sees Professor Dumbledore standing in front of a billboard advertising Divine Magic Perfume. Harry smiles and crosses over to join him. Dumbledore stares at the Divine Magic billboard. Dumbledore has a blackened hand. Harry sees the waitress leave the cafe. Harry holds Dumbledore's left arm. Harry's face contorts as they spin. They're on a street. Dumbledore walks past a market cross. Harry follows him down the dark street. They stop outside a detached house.",
    "592": "The figure is tall with a thin face and beard. He stops and smiles menacingly. Harry appears behind Ginny and raises his wand. Greyback deflects the spell. He flies up in a spiral of black smoke. Ginny and Harry turn in circles, but can see no sign of him. They take refuge on a small island of sand. Bellatrix spots them. Remus and Tonks are still searching. On their tiny island, Ginny and Harry fend off attacks with their wands. Tonks, Remus, and Mr. Weasley join them on the island. They form a circle, back-to-back, wands poised. Bellatrix watches them. Greyback glances at Bellatrix. They change form, and shoot into the sky, the cloud of black spell. They attack the Weasley house, which bursts into flames. Mr. Weasley sprints off. He finds his family safe, watching their house burn. He puts an arm around his wife. The others join them. And they all watch helplessly, as the Weasley house is engulfed in flames. Lavender puts a heart pendant round Ron's neck. Hermione watches Lavender simpering over Ron. She heads back the way they came. Harry nods to Ron, then walks along the corridor. Lavender leaps on Ron's back and he staggers away with her. Professor Dumbledore's cabinet of vials. Harry plunges his face into the pensive. Teenage Tom Riddle at a Slughorn tea party. Slughorn smiles uneasily. Tom taps the hourglass. The memory stops. Harry straightens up. Dumbledore dips his hand into the pensive. Harry stands solemnly in front of Dumbledore, and nods. The Potions class leave. Slughorn turns and sees Harry. Slughorn shifts uneasily. On his way out, Slughorn stops, spins round and stares at Harry, who doesn't flinch. He stomps out. Slughorn closes the spyhole and locks the door. Harry finds Ron in the boy's dormitory. He's sitting on the floor, gazing dreamily out of the window. Ron holds a gift box. Harry moves away, as Ron leans closer. Ron throws down the box, which has a heart on it. Harry stares at Ron, who smiles inanely, a far away look in his eyes. As Ron sits on the floor and gazes up at the moon, Harry reads the card which came with the chocolates. He grins and crosses to Ron. Little hearts float from it. Ron embraces Slughorn. Harry prises him off. Ron sits on the back of the sofa and falls off. Slughorn gives him a potion. Ron drinks. The inane, fixed smile fades. He looks quizzically up at Harry. He fills three glasses. Ron drinks and collapses, foaming at the mouth. Harry runs to Slughorn's potion cabinet, as Ron convulses on the floor. He puts one in Ron's mouth. He leans over Ron, who lies on his back, no longer breathing.",
    "598": "Dumbledore glances down and catches Harry's eye. Snape looks eyes with Dumbledore, Bellatrix glares. Dumbledore's eyes flicker. Harry watches in horror as Dumbledore is flung backwards over the balustrade. The white-haired professor seems to float gently downwards. Snape grabs the distraught Draco. Bellatrix is jubilant. The shape of a skull appears in the dark clouds. Snape rushes Draco down the tower's spiral staircase. Harry follows, as Snape leads the death eaters and the ashen-faced Draco through the school corridors. Bellatrix creates havoc as she strides along a table top in the Great Hall. An Auror is thrown aside. Bellatrix aims her wand at the huge windows. They explode and the candles are snuffed out. Draco, Snape, and the Death Eaters stride through the forest towards Hagrid's cottage. Harry follows. Bellatrix sets fire to the cottage. Harry aims his wand. Harry falls. Bellatrix licks her lips then saunters away. Illuminated by the flames from the burning cottage, Snape stands alone. Harry lies on his back on the hillside. Snape turns away as Harry gets to his feet. Harry staggers forward. Snape deflects the spell. Harry crashes to the ground. Snape walks over to him. Trembling, Harry looks up at Snape, who kicks Harry's wand from his hand. Harry lies motionless on the grassy hillside. Snape hurries away past the burning cottage below him. Harry looks up at the glowering clouds forming the shape of a skull. Harry strides through the school courtyard followed by Hagrid. He pushes past students and teachers. Professor McGonagall, Hermione, Ginny, and Ron stand at the front of the crowd. Harry kneels beside Dumbledore's body. He leans forward and gently touches Dumbledore's cheek. The Horcrux. Harry gently places his hand on Dumbledore's heart. Ginny walks forward and kneels down beside Harry. He rests his head on her shoulder. A tear rolls down Hermione's cheek. Professor McGonagall raises her wand high above her head. The tip of it glows as it points up towards the skull-shaped cloud. Pomfrey raises her wand then Luna. One after another, everyone does the same. Wand after wand points upwards, the tip of each one glowing like a star. Grief-stricken, the staff and students stand in solemn silence. Dumbledore lies before them, his face serene and peaceful. As the wands glow more brightly, light bursts through the clouds and the skull disappears. Harry takes his hand from Dumbledore's heart. His head on Ginny's shoulder, Harry weeps. Sunlight streams in through the damaged window of the Great Hall. The long tables are bare, the seats and benches are empty. The door of Dumbledore's study opens and Harry steps inside. It, too, is bathed in sunlight. Harry walks towards Dumbledore's desk. A pair of half-moon spectacles lies on an open book.",

Bellatrix steps towards Snape. She's behind him. She walks away. Bellatrix stares, open-mouthed. Narcissa and Snape grasp each other's right wrist. Bellatrix waves her wand, and a glowing cord binds the wrists together. Narcissa stares unwaveringly at Snape. Bellatrix stands close to him. The cord binding their wrists fades and disappears. Narcissa releases her grip, and flexes her wrist. A shop, Pieces of Modern Magic. Outside, a mechanical man makes the rabbit on his head disappear under a big top hat. The Weasly twins.

Outside, a little dragon breathes flames. It's roasting chestnuts. A boy buys some. He slides down a chute into a bag. They're in Diagon Alley. They enter the empty and burned out shop the Death Eaters attacked. Harry leads the way, followed by Ron, then Hermione. Ron stops by a window and looks out. Narcissa and Draco look around furtively before entering a narrow alley. The trio leave Ollivander's and peek round the corner, where there's a wanted poster for Fenrir Greyback: The beardy Death-eater who attacked the shop. They follow the Malfoys down the gloomy alleyway. The Malfoys descend steps to a shop with a sign above its door, Borgin and Burke. Narcissa strides in, and Draco follows. The three friends look up, as a light comes on in an arched window in the roof at the rear of the shop. They climb onto an adjoining roof and watch, as the Malfoys are led across a courtyard below into a high room. It reaches from the ground floor to the roof. They see Draco running his hands over a tall, triangular, embossed wooden cabinet. Several figures approach Draco. Harry hauls himself up to get a better view. and Narcissa kisses her son's cheek. someone appears at a window. Harry, Hermione and Ron duck down, as a thin-faced man with a beard looks out. He lowers the blind. Harry looks up and breathes a sigh of relief. The Hogwarts Express chugs through barren moorland. Luna holds magazines. Ginny has a Pygmy Puff. Ginny reads the cover. Luna saunters along the corridor with her magazines. Further back on the train, Hermione, Harry and Ron have a compartment to themselves.",

Harry turns. Wearing a waiter's jacket, Neville walks away. Harry spots Hermione slipping into a curtain. He pulls back the silk drapes to join her. She scuttles away, as Cormac comes through the drapes. Snape opens the curtains. Cormac throws up at his feet. Snape glares at him. Snape walks away. Filch manhandles Draco into the room. Draco glares at Snape. A dark corridor. Snape has Draco pinned against a wall. Harry overhears them from an adjoining corridor. The Hogwarts Express plows through snow-covered countryside. She breathes on the glass then draws, with her finger, the shape of a heart with an arrow through it. She looks lovingly at Ron, whose expression glazes over. She breathes on her love heart, then whispers though the closed door. Ron looks up as Hermione comes to the door. She sees the love heart. Ron looks confused. They both look up at the fading love heart. Christmas at the Weasleys'. Nymphadora Tonks indicates to Harry to remain quiet. Tonks walks away and Remus Lupin follows her, leaving Harry with Mr. Weasley. Ginny sits beside Harry with a plate of dainty mince pies. Mr. Weasley goes. She holds out a pie. He takes a bite from the pie she's holding. Ron plunks down between them with a plate of bigger mince pies. Looking awkward, he turns to Harry and holds out the plate. Ron takes one and bites into it. Harry's with Mr. Weasley in his shed. Harry looks at him thoughtfully. Later, the front door of the house opens. Remus walks out, followed by Tonks. Remus looks out into the night. Tonks steps forward with a concerned expression. Wearing a pink dressing gown, Ginny finds Harry sitting on the stairs. He stands up. She bends down and fastens the lace on his trainer. Ginny rises. They stand close to eachother. They lean closer. A ball of fire hurtles to the ground, creating a flaming circle around the house. In a swirl of black, Bellatrix appears. Harry races out of the house. She laughs and sprints away. Harry dashes through a gap in the flames. It closes, preventing Remus giving chase. Tonks tries to control the flames with her wand. Ginny runs out. Ginny leaps through the flames. Harry chases Bellatrix through the tall reeds. Ginny follows. Harry stands still, surrounded by the swaying reeds. Hearing something, he starts to run again. Ginny is a little way behind. She ploughs through the undergrowth, ending up ankle-deep in water. She hears movement. She steps back as a figure emerges from the reeds.",

Sydney's mouth hangs open. A snow dusted black limousine draws up. A man opens the car door for Sophie. Climbs out onto the street, pink dressed and a light pashmina. She poses for press photographers. Sophie and Elena leave Sydney alone. Sydney boogies on the dance floor with the happy bounces around joyfully as a smiling Sydney jives. Smiling suggestively wraps her arms around Sydney. Images from a moving car. Tall palm trees. Signs read Hollywood, Beverly Hills. The limo sweeps down a main road. A billboard sports an image of a pouting Sophie wearing a nun's habit. Stripped to his socks and boxer shorts, a terrified Sydney tries to gather the courage to leap between two high hotel balconies. He hops back down from the railing. The hotel room's filled with the young, affluent and beautiful. Sophie unzips her blue dress and lets it fall to the floor. She hands Sydney her bottle of beer as she strides out onto the balcony in her bra and knickers. The guests rush over to the adjacent balcony to watch. Smiling victoriously, Sophie stalks into the room from the adjacent balcony. Reluctantly, he wrinkles his nose and snorts like a pig, hopping from one foot to another, his limp wrists held up to his chest. Drinking whiskey at the foot of his bed and half watching a monster movie on TV, he flicks through the channels. It's his mum. He drops the remote control and looks down at his bare hand. The handsome Brill-creamed gent in the '50s movie slides an engagement ring onto Sydney's mum's finger and she gazes love-struck into his eyes. Sydney's transfixed. A sleek black sedan by a fountain outside the 53rd Annual Apollo Awards. Sophie, Elena and Sydney get out and head down the red carpet towards the entrance. Sophie wears gold an ostentatious white fur stole and a long flowing red dress. Inside she does an interview for the cameras. Sydney stands waiting nearby. Lawrence approaches. Sydney's eyes rove in thought as the penny drops. He sits beside Sophie in the award ceremony. The woman onstage announces the winner, Sophie Maes. He looks up from his seat to see that Sophie's wearing his mother's ring. He lowers his eyes. The crowd applauds and Sophie makes for the stage. He runs up behind her. Sophie charges. She pins him on the table. They fall to the floor. She slaps him. Richard watches on the hotel room TV. The magazine models see Sophie kick Sydney. Alison chuckles to herself as she watches the debacle.",

Vincent shields his eyes from the light. Sydney races out of the doorway. Clayton bursts out laughing, then sharply resumes a serious look. Sydney races outside, where his escape is blocked by the fans and photographers amassed behind a red rope cordon. Sydney looks defeated. Then, a young guy lifts the cordon. The bespectacled mop-head guy nods for Sydney to pass and he does, racing off through the crowd. He approaches a pretty flame-haired flight desk attendant at LAX airport. He glares at his mobile then looks up to see himself on a TV mounted to a pillar nearby. Onscreen, Sophie dives on Sydney, pinning him to a table. A close-up shows them grappling on the floor. He smiles blankly at her. Then, he obliges. Looking bedraggled in his ruffled mess of a suit, Sydney sits alone in the departure lounge, impatiently tapping his hand with his mobile phone. A burly guy in a yellow baseball cap, grey jacket and jeans pushes a floor buffer past behind him. Sidney looks at the gold ring in his palm. It sports a spiraling his hand around it and stares off. A yellow taxi drives through the streets. Seated in the back of the taxi, Sydney. He looks out through the window to see La Dolce Vita open- air cinema screening. The people are seated in deck chairs and on blankets, staring up. Sidney searches for Alison in the crowd. On the screen, a man rides on a woman's back. He staggers around, looking left and right, then stops to stare up a grassy incline. His face lights up as he sees Alison, reclining on a blanket, beside a man and a woman. Alison leans in and talks to the man with an air of familiarity. Sidney's face drops, and his shoulders sink. The other woman hugs the man, and they cozy up together. Sidney's smile returns, and he hurries up the slope towards them. Alison squints up at him. She smiles, and he looks around awkwardly. She picks up her notebook and hands it to him. She looks on as he leafs through it. They smile at each other. He tosses the book down on the blanket and offers a hand. She takes it and rises to her feet. They stand hand in hand, facing each other, just inches apart. She smiles, and they share a passionate kiss. They kiss. He secretly takes the ring from his trouser pocket and puts it in the pocket of her floaty, pale blue floral dress. They share a look then turn to face the screen.",

Sidney saunters over to Alison carrying a plate piled high with finger foods. Three beautiful women slink by. Lawrence walks off into the crowd. Party guests whip out their mobile phones in response to the ring tone. A glamorous woman in her 50s approaches heavy featured, debonair Lawrence. Lawrence drifts off with goateed Vincent. Sidney approaches Rachel who stands by herself looking out over the city. She looks at him suspiciously. Beaming she puts down her champagne. Sidney hands her a napkin and a pen. She hands him her autograph. Sidney grins. He rejoins the others. Eleanor gestures to a besuited young man on the opposite side of the pool. He dutifully taps Sophie on the shoulder and she turns to face Eleanor. Sophie is resplendent in a backless white halter neck dress. Sidney's jaw drops. Eleanor waits for her to join them. Pulling up the poolside, Sophie looks around for an appropriate route but is hemmed in by guests absorbed in conversation. Smiling, she scratches her head, then kicks off her glittering high heels before stepping fully clothed into the pool. Photographers takes pictures as she lifts her sleek, jet black hair over her head and wades gracefully towards Eleanor. Clutching her long hair in a bun, she smiles flirtatiously for the camera. She pulls herself up out of the water, her wet dress clinging to the sinuous curves of her lean, shapely body. Eleanor speaks on her cell phone as they leave. Sophie and Eleanor lead the way outside where a bustling crowd of press photographers asking for Sophie's attention. Sidney shields his eyes from glare of the flashing cameras puts a coat over Sophie's shoulders. And they head towards a waiting car. Sidney tries to squeeze into the car beside Sophie. Her Chihuahua. They walk together. Sidney stops with a frown as Alison strides off. Sidney sits at his computer. Lawrence throws him a newspaper. A woman delivers a basket of flowers to Lawrence. He reads the gift tag. Gray-haired Lawrence gives Sidney a prickly look, then walks away. Alison looks at a tight-lipped Sidney and shrugs. He turns back to his computer. Sidney zips up his fly as he rounds a corner into a white-walled corridor. He sees Elizabeth Maddox approaching and stops anxiously in his tracks. She stumbles and falls down in a heap in front of him. Alison watches with baited breath from the end of the corridor. Slack-jawed, Sidney gawks at her and she raises her eyebrows.",
    "614": "Sidney scurries off excitedly. Back at his apartment, he types on a laptop at his coffee table. Grinning proudly, he scratches his chin and looks down at a pile of magazines on the table. He takes some of Sophie's promotional literature from the pile and regards it with a grimace. It's Chihuahua, Sophie stares back at him from the page. He dials a number on his cell phone. A van sweeps past the Soho Grand Hotel. Sidney fidgets as he tries to get comfortable on a sofa in the spacious white lobby. The cushion he's sitting on slips forward and he sinks awkwardly into the crack. A tall, slender woman emerges from a lift to find him struggling with the cushion. His shirt and tank top have ridden up unflatteringly. The woman towers over him. Sidney's eyes widen. She shrugs. Sidney plonks the fishbowl down on the bar. She stifles a self-conscious smile. On a TV. Alison's eyes are downcast. He comes back for the fishbowl. He heads off. Alison stares down sadly at an untouched glass of White Russian. Clayton presides over a staff meeting. Sidney's irked. Sidney scowls as Lawrence basks in the adulation of his colleagues. Sidney catches up with him outside the meeting. He grins broadly then heads off before turning back heavy-browed. Sidney screws up his face. Lawrence gives him a jaunty nod and saunters off. Lawrence takes a seat behind his desk to address his underlings. A blonde. She strips and dances. The stripper reveals a penis. Mrs. Harding and her two young daughters looking. Sidney quickly cups Bobbie's dangling penis. A stone-faced receptionist stares at Sidney, who sits outside Clayton's office obsessively scrubbing his hand with a tissue. The receptionist frowns. Sidney looks in at Eleanor and Clayton, who stand at a desk discussing an A3 mock-up of a potential magazine cover. Eleanor exits and walks uneasily past Sidney. Clayton looms large in the doorway. Sidney skulks into the office with his head hung low. He sits as Clayton paces. He's behind Sidney. He walks round to face him. Sidney looks him in the eye. Clayton stares coldly. Clayton turns away in his high-backed swivel chair as Sidney lopes out with his tail between his legs. Seated party guests eat under white marquees on the lawn outside Clayton's sprawling mansion. Alison's puzzled. Sidney rises from the table and lets his hand linger on Alison's shoulder before sauntering away. Alison looks behind her, then she too rises from the table. Sidney, dressed in long shorts and a Hawaiian shirt, spots Sophie approach Lawrence. Sidney joins Lawrence and Sophie. Sidney gawks. Sidney lopes off. Sydney spies on them from behind a bush. Lawrence stands with Alison, playfully tossing nuts into his mouth.",

A teenage girl with short brown hair tied back in a small ponytail swigs from a little size plastic bottle as she contemplates an armchair standing on the lawn, in front of her. In flashback, the girl steps out of the knickers and walks slowly across the room towards a skinny boy sitting bare-chested in the same armchair. Wearing just a T-shirt, the girl gives a tentative smile as she straddles the boy's lap and brings her rosebud lipped mouth close to his faith. The girl stops the boy's mouth with a tender kiss. The shaggy blond dog does what he's told. The girl takes a swig of juice and wags her mouth on the sleeve of her hoodie. She picks up a pregnancy kit. She reaches for the washroom key. He hands her the key. In the washroom, she unzips her jeans and sitting down on the lavatory seat, she opens the pregnancy detection kit and brings out a narrow paddle shaped stick and puts it into position. She pulls the stick out and gives it a cursory look. Then, hurries back through to the store towards the counter. She slaps a pack of sweets onto the counter and gazes at the test. She shakes it. She rolls her eyes at the counter clerk and leaves the store, stick in one hand. Her expression is suddenly forlorn. Juno slings the rope candy onto the branch of a tree and makes a noose. She bites in to the liquorish rope and wanders off home. Bedrooms, the light switch doubles as a doll's penis. Naked dolls are clustered on the mantelpiece. There's a photo of Bleeker playing his guitar. Juno dials a number on her hamburger-shaped phone. A girl lying on her bad with a rabbit on her chest answers. They take up the armchair. The armchair is shoved into the back of a car. Bleeker hands Juno a note and she beams. Bleeker brown and yellow sports kit. Juno's sitting in the armchair on his front lawn. On a rug, a posse of runners in brown and yellow come by. Juno lowers her eyes. Beneath his yellow sweatband, Bleeker's eyes cross and what little color there was in his pale cheeks washes away. Juno blinks happily. Bleeker swallows. A thin smile flashes across Juno's heart-shaped face and she cuts a pipe between her teeth. She gets on her bike and rides off, leaving Bleeker clutching his sandwich. Juno cycles up to Dancing Elk School. She parks her bike and secures it with a chain lock. She makes her way past the oncoming throng of students, most of them taller than her, and reaches her locker.",

There's an urgent rustling in the maize stalks beyond the swing, which gradually dies away. Next morning, Caroline sits in the dining room with Morgan, who's holding her walkie talkie. Morgan nods. Caroline smiles warmly and nods back. She grins. Bo sits in the adjoining lounge, watching cartoons. Graham walks over. Bo does so. There are three glasses of water on the TV set. Caroline looks across at Merrill, who sits at the other end of the long dining room table. He rests his head on his hand and looks up at her. Merrill grins at Caroline and absently rubs his finger on the table top. She shrugs. Caroline glances at Morgan, who's studying her walkie talkie. She looks back at Merrill. Graham walks across the lounge and spots three glasses of water on a small table. He leans over and picks them up. He stands upright and sees some more glasses of water on a nearby cabinet. Graham puts the three glasses back down and walks into the dining room. He sits at the table by Merrill. She checks her notebook. She gives them a patronizing look. Graham looks tense and awkward. She nods. Graham shrugs, and looks uncertainly at Merrill. Graham blows out his cheeks. And Merrill looks at the ceiling. Merrill holds up his hands and turns away in frustration. Bo comes into the dining room and taps Graham on the arm. Bo leaves. Merrill shifts awkwardly. Graham considers for a moment. Bo comes back. Caroline looks up. In the lounge, the TV shows news footage of a corn field with a line of crop circles similar to Graham's. A man talks to camera. 17 circles are scattered across a map of India. Footage shows people standing in some of the circles. Graham's steely blue eyes gleam as he stares at the TV. Morgan takes a puff of his inhaler. Caroline stands behind him. Graham and Caroline come out of the house. She shakes her head as they stroll away from the farmhouse. Caroline nods and opens the driver's door of her police car. She smiles and gets in. Graham stands and watches as Caroline pulls around an island of grass in the middle of a stretch of gravel and heads off down the driveway. Morgan and Bo sit in the back of a car. Bo points a finger at Morgan. And he brushes it away. Graham turns the radio off again. Graham, in the driving seat, glances over his shoulder at Morgan, then, turns back to the road. Morgan sighs wearily. An aerial view looks directly down onto a quiet freeway, which runs through a suburban part of town.",

She sees Salim and runs onto a waiting train. Salim finds her and pulls her off the train by her hair. He grimaces towards Jamal rushing down a flight of stairs. Then with the other men, they manhandled the three the crowd to the exit. Salim forces Latika into a waiting car. Jamal is still trying to weave his way through the crowds. Jamal arrives to see one thug holding a blade to Latika's face. Salim points threateningly at Jamal. The thug slices the blade across her face. He jeers at Jamal as he slams on the car window. Jamal looks on helplessly as the car speeds off into the traffic. Behind the scenes, the host walks into the toilets. Jamal sits in the cubical. The host goes to urinal. He leaves the toilets. Jamal exits the cubiclal and approaches the sink to wash his hands. He looks at himself in the mirror and sighs. He notices at the bottom of the mirror the letter B has been written in the condensation. His jaw drops as he looks through the door. He looks puzzled as he returns to the studio floor. With a sly look, the host sees Jamal being led in by staff. Jamal sits back in his chair and stares at the host. Lights come on and illuminate the host's false smile. Jamal looks up from the screen to see a nasty grin on the host's face. Again, we see that written in the condensation. The host's face hardens suddenly. Jamal shakes his head. Again, Jamal shakes his head. The host tenses his jaw. The host looks disappointed. The host rubs his chin and shifts uncomfortably in his chair. He shakes his head. With eyebrows raised, he regards Jamal. The audience are on their feet. The director and his assistants all smile. The host gets up. He dances. He pats Jamal patronizingly on the back of his head. Then he glares at the director off-stage. The director gives him a happy thumbs up. The host maintains a grim serious expression. A smile appears fleetingly on Jamal's face as the host grins through gritted teeth. Backstage, the host waits for Jamal to leave. Jamal turns to follow the host down the corridor. He slaps him on the back then grips him by the shoulder. Two policemen stand outside the door. They cover Jamal's head in a blanket. The director approaches the host. The policemen bundle Jamal into a waiting vehicle. Srinivas is at the wheel. At the police station, the inspector and Jamal drink milky tea in glasses.",

Present day, back in the police station, Srinivas inserts a VHS into a player. Jamal is slumped in a chair opposite the inspector's desk. Srinivas slaps Jamal. Jamal stares at the ground. The inspector points the remote control at the TV. The five-year-old Jamal squats over a hole in a makeshift shanty toilet. Salim sits guard outside. A man rushes down towards the toilets. Prakash leans over painfully. Jamal pulls his pants up. Old clips of Amitabh's 70's action films. The helicopter flies over Jamal's roofless loo. Salim jams his chair against the door locking Jamal in. Through a hole in the wall, Jamal sees hundreds of men women and children flock to the runway. He kicks the door in vain. Jamal takes out of his pocket a creased photo of his hero, Amitabh Bachchan. He looks down through the hole in the floor to the cess pit beneath. He looks from the cess pit to the photo and back. Then he pinches his nose, and jumps. One arm stays aloft, holding the photo clear of the effluent. Amitabh descends from his helicopter to cheering crowds. Jamal appears covered from head to toe in excrement. He dashes towards Amitabh making his way through the crowds of photographers and onlookers. Salim stands at the front of the crowd hemmed in by security. In the distance, we see Jamal running holding onto his photo of Amitabh. The crowd parts for stinking Jamal. He makes straight for Amitabh. Salim stares at his brother in disbelief. People hold their noses. Amitabh signs the photo and hands it back to Jamal. A hazy orange sun rises above the teeming streets, slums and skyscrapers of Mumbai. Jamal's mother. She scrubs Jamal with soap. Salim looks back at his brother mischievously and disappears. A man sits next to a film projector in a cinema. Salim enters the projectionist's booth. He shows him Jamal's autographed photo of Amitabh. The man thrusts the photo into the light from the projector. He hands Salim two coins. Salim winks and salutes the man, then bumps into Jamal outside. Jamal on the video. The policemen stare at Jamal. Jamal concentrates hard. Jamal smiles briefly. Trains speed through a slum. Jamal's mother washes brightly colored clothing in a pool as young Jamal and Salim frolic in the water. Their mother smiles at the two boys playing. Suddenly, she turns to look at the trains. She looks worried and scared. The train passes by revealing a crowd of men wielding clubs, knives, and axes running towards them. People drop what they are doing and flee.",
    "65": "Evelyn steadies herself on the open car door. She stares at Gittes for a long moment. Then he gently tugs the car door closed. Evelyn remains unperturbed. He drives off into the Wilshire traffic, leaving Evelyn looking after him. Gittes goes through the door to the Secretary. She looks up. She recognizes Gittes again and is not happy to see him. The Secretary immediately gets up and goes into the inner office. Gittes turns and strolls around the office a moment. He stops as he spots a photo of the man with the cane Gittes had seen photos of earlier. He is standing high in the mountains, near a pass. Gittes pulls out a cigarette case, offers the Secretary one. She refuses. He lights up and begins to hum 'The Way You Look Tonight,' strolling along the wall looking at more photographs. Here he spots several photos of a much younger Mulwray, along with Julian Cross. Gittes, still humming, turns to the Secretary. She gets up, annoyed, and goes into Yelburton's inner office. Gittes goes back to the photographs. He hears a SCRATCHING SOUND, apparently coming from just outside the outer door. He moves quickly to it, hesitates, swiftly opens the door. Workmen are behind it, scraping away Mulwray's name on the outer door, looking up at Gittes in some surprise. The Secretary returns, sees the workman on the floor. Gittes heads toward the door. Gittes nods graciously, heads on into Yelburton's office. There is a subtle but perceptible difference in Yelburton's attitude. Gittes nods. Gittes smiles, leaves an unsmiling Yelburton. Gittes enters, drops his hat on Sophie's desk. Sophie tries to tell him something but Gittes goes on into his office. She looks up when he enters. Gittes moves to his desk, barely breaking stride at the sight of her. Is sitting, smoking. Gittes buzzes Sophie. Evelyn nods. She lights another cigarette. She signs it. Cross is visibly surprised. Cross nods. Gittes glances down at the fish whose isinglass eye is glazed over with the heat of cooking. Gittes laughs. Gittes shrugs. Cross starts to reply, then there's the SOUND of a MARIACHI BAND and some men in formation clear a bluff about a hundred yards off. They are dressed like Spanish dons on horseback. Cross shakes his head. Cross looks to Gittes in some real surprise. Cross looks hatefully at Gittes. Dark and quiet except for the whirring of fans. Gittes approaches one of the CLERKS at a desk. The Clerk's droopy eyes widen a little which is a snotty remark. Gittes smiles. Gittes regards his back a moment, then goes to the stacks. Gittes sees the Clerk turn to another, say something. The second clerk gets on the phone.",
    "650": "The male singer kneels and cradles the body of a woman. A thick mist wafts across the stage. We suddenly see an image of five-year-old Latika chasing a train followed by an image of a very beautiful Latika, now in her 20s. Then, back on the game show, Jamal looks lost in thought. In the director's edit suite. The video plays in the police station. The 10-year-old brothers walk along a pipeline. From an aerial view, we see the boys are heading toward the distant skyscrapers of Mumbai. The city sprawls with high rise apartments and green parks, juxtaposed with huge slums and shanty towns. Jamal walks alone through slum streets strewn with rubbish and debris. He approaches a group of men scavenging on the rubbish tip. Jamal wanders the teeming streets of Mumbai by day, and by night. He questions some young boys his age. They shake their heads. He walks through a crowded night market with stalls selling a thousand and one different things. Then he's in uniform walking through a kitchen. Salim also in uniform, dozes on a kitchen worktop. Salim wakes up. Jamal descends into a subway, where a blind Arvind sings and begs. Jamal stops and recognizes Arvind. Jamal digs into his pockets, finds the $100 bill and gives it to Arvind. Jamal takes the note and turns it over. Arvind feels his way from Jamal's hands up his arms to his face. He smiles. Jamal grips Arvind by the shoulders. Jamal looks happily surprised with the news. Jamal touches Arvind's face gently and runs off along the subway. A worker starts to fumigate the subway. Jamal disappears running through the smoke. He emerges with Salim through exhaust fumes on Pila Street at night. The street is lined with brothels. Prostitutes sitting on chairs on the pavement. Salim questions a woman. She shakes her head and they move on. Jamal asks another woman and she pats his cheek. A girl in a silk costume and jewelry dances whirling round and round. Salim and Jamal wind their way down Pila Street. Women call down from balconies and open windows on men on the crowded street. Salim and Jamal question two women who direct the boys to an entrance down the busy corridor. The dancing girl continues her steps under the watchful gaze of an elderly male teacher who claps to maintain her tempo. Jamal and Salim walk through a brothel, pulling aside curtains covering alcoves where couples are having sex. Jamal approaches a girl. The girl points to a closed door. Jamal peers through a crack in the door and sees the beautiful dancing girl. Salim yanks Jamal away and peers through the hole. His eye widens in surprise.",
    "652": "Latika appears and gently pushes Salim's gun down. Jamal looks incredulous as Salim pulls Latika back into the room. Jamal remains rooted to the spot. Back in the police station, the inspector and Srinivas stare at the sweating Jamal. Srinivas grins. Jamal leans over toward the inspector. Two other uniformed policemen rush into the room and eventually subdue a raging Jamal. The inspector wipes the sweat from his hands and face. Jamal carries a tray of tea at the call center. She holds an Eastern magazine. Jamal rushes around, delivering tea to the call center workers. They all sit at computers, wearing headsets. Dave rushes off to a nearby TV showing the game show. Dave signals to everyone. They start to dial the number on their mobile phones. The read out say it has found over 26,000 Latikas as the name scroll across the screen. Jamal gulps and puts on his headset. Across the room, call center managers walk around, monitoring staff calls. Back on the game show. The host shakes his head. The director. He hands him a check. Jamal is ascending in a lift on the construction site of a skyscraper. Hundreds of meters above, Salim waits. Jamal arrives at the open top floor which has no walls and offers panoramic views of Mumbai. Jamal sees a guy dressed in an expensive shirt, wearing jewelry and dark glasses. Salim smiles and removes his glasses. Jamal lunges for Salim. They both fall off the building. Jamal blinks awake from his vision and punches Salim instead. Jamal and Salim sit on the edge of the building. The vast city scape is spread out before them. Salim is phoned. Salim shakes his head as he watches his brother go. At night, in Salim's apartment, both Salim and Jamal are asleep. Salim gets up. Jamal opens his eyes but lies still. Jamal sneaks to the landing to spy on Salim downstairs as he loads a gun. Jamal watches as Salim kneels on a mat to pray. Salim touches his forehead to the ground. Salim leaves his apartment block and heads for his car. As Salim drives off, Jamal appears in a tuk-tuk, following closely behind. Salim's car pulls up to a sprawling palatial house situated on the hillside surrounded by construction sites. He drives through the electronic gates. Jamal's tuk-tuk then arrives outside the gates. He jumps out then watches Salim approach a beautiful woman in dark glasses standing on a balcony. Salim collects a small package from her then drives past the gates where Jamal is hiding. The young woman notices Jamal lurking at the entrance as a guard closes the gates. The guard goes to the gatehouse. The woman removes her glasses for a better look at Jamal.",
    "663": "He folds them up. He lays them down. He does a double take on seeing his physique in the mirror. He flexes his muscles. He turns away from admiring his new body in the mirror and reaches for his shirt. Glancing through the window he catches sight of Mary Jane, MJ in her room in the house next door. He smiles as she primps her hair. He walks back to his mirror and grins. Coming downstairs he places one hand on the molding, walks on the wall around the corner, and then leaps to the ground. Peter heads out. Peter stands and stares having witnessed the altercation between MJ and her father. He sets off down the street after the pretty young red head who is wearing Calfland's boots, short skirt and a zipped cardigan. MJ marches down the sidewalk, arms folded. She reaches the school bus stop and grinds the sole of her left boot on the ground. Peter's a bit behind. MJ climbs into her friend's Ford Mustang Convertible. The school bus beats past now chased by Peter. He makes a grab for the bus and catches hold of a poster stuck to his side. It comes away in his hand and rips its full length. The bus zooms on leaving Peter in the middle of the street with a large portion of the poster sticking to his fingers. He looks at his hand and ponders. The imposing Osborne home. Harry rushes into the study where his father is lying face down on the floor. He helps his father to a seat. A flashback. Norman stares in shock. Peter is having lunch at school. He looks up from his French fries and sees MJ walking towards with a tray of food. He smiles at her. But her smile is for the people behind him. As she passes she slips on a spilled drink. Peter leaps to his feet, catches her, then the tray, then the food. Peter grins inanely. Raising her eyebrows MJ tries to coax an answer from him. She walks off. Peter gawps at her retreating figure. Then he sits back down at the table letting out a big sigh. He raises his right hand, a fork is sticking to his palm. He can't shake it off. So he pulls the fork. It's attached to web like threads coming from his wrist. It snaps. But another web shoots across to the next table and then sneers a tray. Peter holds it towards him. He ducks, it flies over his head and lands on the back of Flash Thompson who is with MJ. Covered in mush the guy turns around as Peter makes a quick exit. Tracking the tray behind him.",
    "665": "Still nothing, he tries again. Out flies a column of threads. Palm uppermost, he flexes his wrist again and another web shoots out and falls to the ground. On the third attempt, the web wraps round the jib of the crane. Peter has hold of the other end. He grabs it in both hands and leaps up onto the wall surrounding roof. He takes a quick glance down to the street below. Then studies himself, ready to jump. Clinging for dear life to the web, he swings to the air like Tarzan on a creeper and lands running on the roof opposite. Unable to stop, he smashes into a wall poster and slams to the ground. Later that evening, he races to his aunt and uncle's house. In the darkness inside he sees the paint, brushes, roller and tray all set out. He crosses over to the sink where he spots a note. Michelangelo! Meat loaf and veggies in the oven. His attention is drawn to the argument across at MJ's. His face falls. He takes the garbage out. The backyard of the houses are separated by a small wire fence. MJ barges out of her back door. She stands there for a moment, then turns to Peter. She sticks her hands on her coat pockets. She moves a little closer to him. She looks a little coy. He leans on the fence. MJ gives a little shrug of her shoulders. Her eyes fixed on his face, she moves over towards the fence. They both turn on hearing the engine of Flash's convertible. Peter's on his way to look down the passage way between the houses. Peter flicks to the paper, looking at cars for sale. Auto's away offers used cars at great prices over $27,000, over $25,000. He turns the page. Motor Town used cars are cheaper, only around 15,000. On the next page, prices are down to around $3,000. Peter then spots an advert. Need cash? Amateur wrestlers, $3,000 for 3 minutes on the ring, colorful characters a must and a phone number. He dreams of MJ and the sports car. Peter writes costume possibilities and sketches a cape for go. He writes utility belt then puts the lines for it. He screws up the paper. More sketches then symbol for the question mark. Now he draws spiders on the page. He imagines a spider with red legs and a blue body with red dot. A red checked mask comes into his mind and the inevitable spider's web. He adds color. Red checks on boots at the blue body stocking. Next to complete the join, red checks all over the head mask show the blades, center strip down the chest and round the waist and a touch of red along the arm.",
    "666": "Next morning using a can of Dr. Pepper as a target, Peter is busy fine tuning his wrist webbing. He pulls it too and then catches it. He's not so lucky with the bed lamp. Peter closes the partly open door. He turns round. His room has spider's web dangling from wall to wall. Norman Osborn is reading the Daily Bugle. The devils in Norman's mind cause him to close his eyes tightly and he shakes his head wearily. Uncle Ben gives an OK sign to Aunt May as Peter walks out of the door. Downtown, the four-dour automobile pulls up at the curb. Peter looks away. A look of pain creases Uncle Ben's face. He nods of his head slightly. A somber Peter again looks away from his uncle. Uncle Ben, his face grim, gets ready to move off. Peter combers out of the car and stands on the middle of the road. A brown paper bag in his hand. He starts to cross the road. Watches as his uncle makes a left turn out of sight. And then he walks off away from the library. Peter makes his way up a stairway on the wrestling arena. From the balcony, he watches as Bone Saw McGraw, the master of disaster, slams an opponent on the floor then jumps on him leading with an arm to his throat. The large, long-haired, muscle man takes the ploddeds. Fans rub big toy saws over their arms. Being massaged by four leather-clad beauties. Peter joins the queue. Bone Saw hauls his opponent out of the ring. Bone Saw grabs the mic. Peter bolts then slips through the ropes. Th crowd charm the hostility as the cage is set up above the wrestling ring. Peter wear the spider and web brazened on his sweatshirt looks up as the cage is slowly lowered around the ring trapping him in. Bone Saw charges. As Peter leaps in the air. Bone Saw cunks into the cage. Bone Saw jumps up. Peter somersaults out of his weight. Then uses his web to leap out of reach. Bone Saw is handed a folding chair. He crashes it twice over Peter's head. And when Peter's done, thuds it across his back. Grabbing Peter by a leg, Bone Saw crashes the youth into the cage bars. Bone Saw's handed a golf club. As the big wrestler charges, Peter on his back on the floor, lashes out with his right foot into Bone Saw's body and face. Bone Saw comes again, Peter uses both feet and propels the big man under the ropes. Bone Saw collapses to the floor. Peter's eyes sparkle with the with the eye-hole at the balled cover, as he listens to the crowd.",
    "667": "Later, in the arena office, $100 is laid on the desk in front of him. Peter waits expectantly. Peter screws up his face. Peter glares at the promoter and then storms out of the office, passing a tall, burly unshaven guy with bleached hair who barges in and throws a canvas bag at the promoter. In the corridor, Peter overhears. Through the frosted glass wall, Peter sees the gunman cob the promoter. The gunman makes his escape. Peter stands aside as the robber escapes in the elevator. The promoter with a gash on the right side of his temple sneers at the youth. Then heads back along the corridor after the security guard. Peter smacks as he calls the elevator. Outside is a hooded jogging top over the sweatshirt. He watches police cars draw up. Peter sees a crowd of people milling around on the sidewalk. He looks on curiously. Peter pushes his way through the crowd. He's lying on the ground. Peter is beside him. The gray-head old man opens his eyes and tries to focus. His eyes light on Peter and he attempts a smile. The old man takes his nephew's right hand in his. Uncle Ben's eyes close. His head lolls to one side. His grip on Peter's hand loosens until his hand slips out of the youth's grasp. Peter, tears running down his cheeks, looks at the peaceful face of his dead uncle. The young man sobs. Having overheard the cop, Peter's face grows determined. His jaw set. He stands up and walks away. He runs into a dark alley way, pulls off his zipped up jogging top, put on his balaclava. Spider-Man leaps up on a wall at the end of the alley way. He clambers, climbs, and leaps up the side of a building, almost scurrying along with great speed. He spots a flag pole on a building opposite and jumps sailing through the air, grabbing the pole with both hands, then like a gymnast swings round and round until he builds the momentum to catapult him through the air on to the adjoining rooftop. He leaps from roof to roof until he lands on top of a dome. Far below, he sees the automobile being chased by police. He shoots a web to an adjacent building. He looks up at the corners of the building to which his web is attached. Glances down at the streets way below then takes a deep breath. He launches himself off the dome. As he races towards the building opposite, he shoots another web to pull him away. Then another as he zig-zags his way along far above the trolling streets. Each time it seems he's going to plummet to the ground, he shoots out another web and pulls himself along, again like Tarzan swinging from vine to vine.",
    "673": "Peter watches as Aunt May lays flowers on Uncle Ben's grave. Peter helps the white-haired elderly woman to her feet. Aunt May's coat billows in the stiff breeze, which also blows falling leaves around the two of them. Clutching her bag to her and, with one hand on her hat, she strides away. Peter stands with his back to the departing figure. Peter is sitting at the dining table. Aunt May comes through from the kitchen holding a tea pot. She strides up to the table and pours a cup of tea. She sits down next to him at the table. Peter, in blue shirt and tie and spectacles still on, lowers his eyes then looks at his aunt who sips her tea. He nods his head. She looks at him quizzically. Aunt May stares intently at her nephew. Tears well up in Peter's eyes. He stretches out his hand to place it on hers. Her eyes fixed on Peter's face, Aunt May removes her hand from under his. He gazes at her through tearful eyes and looks away. Aunt May gets to her feet. She leans on the table for support, then about turns and runs up the stairs. Peter sits at the table. Octavius is in his lab. Two of the limbs push a curved base in a replica fusion chamber in a space from which now four curved pillars rise. Octavius eases the final girder securely it into position. He steps back standing inside the fusion chamber which floats on the river below. He looks up at the structure and the limb. Suddenly, Octavius spins around. The houseman enters as Harry drinks. Bernard turns and walks out. The lightning flashes making Harry's features in a pallid white. Harry strides over to the open French windows which lead out onto a balcony. He goes outside. His glass in his hand. He stops when he hears a distant thud. He starts to look around the vast terrace-like balcony. Lights on the pillars and small trees and bushes are dormant. The balcony judders as the thuds seem to move closer. Harry, his face grim and curious, steps forward towards the balustrade. As he looks over the parapet, one of the mechanical limbs rears up and throws him off his feet. Harry's glass flies in the air. The pincer catches it. A limb grabs Harry by the ankle. Octavius smiles. The limb hauls Harry back on to the balcony. Aided by another limb, Harry is set down on the ground. He stares at Octavius. The four mighty limbs start to move away with Octavius carried in midair. He turns to Harry. Octavius scuttles like a spider out of Harry's sight. Peter reads it at a newsstand.",
    "677": "Octavious covers his face, Spider-Man fires more webs. Spider-Man somersaults back, jumps to avoid the mechanical limbs and limbos under a bridge. With two webs attached to two limbs Octavius manages to catapult Spider-Man towards a covered walkway. Landing on Octavius and knocks him off the roof. Octavius uses one of the limbs to thrust Spider-Man into the train. He crashes through a door, stops at the one opposite, then spins around two poles. He tangles as Octavious who struggles through and climbs up to the roof. Spider-Man turns to see why. He presses himself to the side of the train to avoid an oncoming one. While it passes he cambers out of the roof. Spider-Man spots a limb moving under the train. He crawls down. The passengers find Spider-Man at one window and Octavius at the one opposite. Octavius punches Spider-Man who falls down onto the street below. Quick webs grab him out of the way of cars and up into the air. He swings along beside the elevated track, then bounds over high buildings and flings himself down. He shoots web at Octavius and lands on him. Octavius gets the upper hand, clutching Spider-Man with two of his long metal limbs. He smashes Spider-Man into a train window. He flails Spider-Man, who then manages to stick his feet to the side of the train. Octavius holds him tightly in his arms and his head smashes through signs on the side of the track. A train is coming the other way. Octavius lets go, and the train hits Spider-Man. Swinging gracefully with long of web. Seeing him come, Octaviuos pulls two passengers from the train and holds them up. He tosses a woman at Spider-Man who swoops down, catches her then deposits her into a web safety net. Next, Octavius throws the man he's holding. Again, Spider-Man sweeps the passenger up before he hits the track, and then places him in a web mat. He punches the driver. As Spider-Man lands behind Octavius, a limb pushes a lever. The train picks up speed, sending the passengers whining. Octavius tosses the lever to Spider-Man. Octavius leaps off the train. Spider-Man heads for the front. A further explosion burns the mask which Spider-Man peels off. Blinks to clear his eyes and realizes the train is hurdling through the city towards the end of the line. The unmasked Spider-Man leaps down onto the track. Raises himself against the train and uses his feet to shove against the sleepers as an attempt to decelerate. Spider-Man jumps back onto the train, clutching his right knee as the train continues its relentless surge through the city. Spider-Man leaps anxiously from side to side, then shoots webs right and left.",
    "678": "As the train hurdles towards the river, a desperate looking Spider-Man fires webs at buildings. A block of web shoots out. The two webs attach to buildings either side of the track, and Spider-Man takes the string. Once again, Spider-Man out front takes the strain. The web breaks and Spider-Man falls forward. It rips Spider-Man's costume in several places, and battles the front of the train as the costume tears away his arms as his hands holds the webs uses them to restrain the train forward thrust. Spider-Man's features are contorted as some of the webs start to break. The train approaches the buffers. It crashes through them and careens forward to the very end. The first carriage teeters over the edge. Spider-Man stands as if glued to the front of the train. He continues to hold the webs attached to the buildings behind them. The train grinds to a halt. Spider-Man's eyes close. He releases the web and slumps forward. Hands reach out to prevent him from falling. The passengers lift the unconscious, unmasked Spider-Man into the carriage. His head falling back, the costumed figure is passed along the carriage over people's heads. Willing hands reaching out to support him, until he reaches the center of the carriage, where he's gently lowered to the floor. His face visible, the passengers stare at him. The kid's eyes open and his gloved hands touch his face. A worried look creeps into his eyes as he realizes he has no mask. He sits up as a passenger crouches down. The passenger looks round and two boys step forward. The younger of the two stretches out his hand. In it, Spider-Man's mask. Peter takes it. Through tear-filled eyes, Peter gazes at the two boys standing in front of him. Then lowers his head, and slips on the mask to become Spider-Man once more. Spider-Man sits up straight. Then, struggling to rise, is helped to his feet by more willing hands. These same hands steady him. The door behind Spider-Man clatters in. Octavius climbs on board. Spider-Man turns to face him. A passenger steps forward. The first man gulps. Others step between Spider-Man and Octavius. He simply smiles. Using two of the limbs, he sweeps them aside, leaving a clear route to Spider-Man. Spider-Man indicates to those around him with a raised palm and a nod of the head, and staggers forward. A punch from a mechanical limb sends Spider-Man to the floor where he lies helpless. An electric storm hovers over the Osborn home. Inside, Harry drinks. He turns to see Octavius holding Spider-Man above his head. Harry points to the couch, where he saw Spider-Man stand over his dead father. Octavius lays the bound figure down.",
    "68": "The car trunk pops open and a hand reaches inside, pulling out a folded white sheet. A can of shoe polish is grabbed from the shelf. DANTE dips his fingers into the shoe polish and writes large letters on the unfurled sheet, leaning on the cooler. DANTE stands on a garbage can and tucks a corner of the sheet under the awning. He jumps down. The banner reads I ASSURE YOU, WE'RE OPEN. The door sign shifts from CLOSED to OPEN. The clock reads 6:20. DANTE leans behind the counter, the morning routine completed. He stares ahead, catatonic, then drops his head in his hands. The store, with its makeshift banner looming in the dim morning hour, just after dawn. A car drives by. DANTE waits on a customer (ACTIVIST) buying coffee. The ACTIVIST leans on a briefcase and drinks his coffee. Another CUSTOMER leans in the door. The ACTIVIST lifts his briefcase onto the counter. He opens it and extracts a sickly-looking lung model. The ACTIVIST hands him something from the briefcase. Hands him a picture. The CUSTOMER exits. Another CUSTOMER comes up to the counter. A blank wall. JAY steps into the frame, followed by SILENT BOB. JAY then throws down with a makeshift slam dance, spinning his arm and fake-hitting SILENT BOB. JAY pulls off his coat and swings it into the arms of SILENT BOB. SILENT BOB lights a smoke. SILENT BOB points to something off-screen. SILENT BOB nods. JAY makes blow job faces down an imaginary line of guys, looking quite like a performing seal. He throws a little humming sound behind each nod. He then hops up quickly. The small crowd begins to chant and jeer in DANTE's face. VERONICA enters and surveys the mess. The CROWD throws cigarettes at DANTE, pelting him in the face. Suddenly, a loud blast is heard, and white powder explodes over the throng. Everyone turns to face. VERONICA as she stands in one of the freezer cases, holding a fire extinguisher. The CROWD looks among themselves. Someone points to O.C. The ACTIVIST carries his briefcase surreptitiously toward the door. VERONICA jumps off the freezer case, training the nozzle of the extinguisher on the ACTIVIST. She pokes the extinguisher nozzle at him, warningly. He reaches into his briefcase. He pulls out a business card and hands it to her. She reads it. He nods. He nods again. She blasts him with more chemical as he exits. He quickly flees. The CROWD sheepishly exits, one by one, offering apologetic glances. VERONICA watches the crowd disperse, disgusted. DANTE tries to regain his composure. The last of the crowd exits. DANTE is sitting on the floor, head in his folded arms. She slaps him.",
    "683": "She moves her left hand to his head. Her fingers caress his temple. Her hand slides down his cheek. His eyelids flicker and almost close. MJ turns and walks slowly away. Peter lowers his head and swallows. His head droops. With a smile on her face, she saunters away. Peter enters his apartment building. He climbs a dark stairway and reaches a landing. A door opens behind Peter. A man playing cards looks out at him. He snatches it. He screws up his face. Mister Ditkovich's daughter, Ursula, drops a ladle and sets fire to the stove. The door is shut in Peter's face. Peter lets himself into his apartment. He switches on the light in his single room home. He rolls off the satchel strapped to his back, sits down on the bed, his face glum. His back is to the opened window. On the bedside cabinet, photos of Aunt May, Uncle Ben and MJ. Beside them is a radio set, which he switches on. The morning sun lights up the skyline of New York. Mister Ditkovich barges past Peter and into the restroom. He closes the door, then opens it. Peter leans forward and shuts the door. Harry and Peter enter a lab. Harry leaves Peter with Doctor Octavius. Peter looks around. They're having tea. The doctor nods. Peter is in a laundromat, reading Longfellow. He lays the volume down on top of a pile of other poetry books and goes to the washing machine. He opens it. As he stretches in to remove the laundry, he looks across at the only other person in the laundromat, who is paying him no attention. Peter stuffs the Spider-Man costume in his bag, then checks his boxers. The white is now stained with blue and red from the costume. Ditto his once white socks. Peter stands by the window of his apartment. He lugs off his T-shirt, drops the shirt on the floor and opens the curtain door of his wardrobe. Hanging on the rail, a Spider-Man outfit, and a suit, shirt and tie. In front of the mirror, he fastens the tie. He runs down the stairs. He's in his boxers. His daughter stares as he pulls up his trousers and walks into a room. Cabs pull up outside the theater. MJ's face is displayed prominently at the entrance. As crowds walk into the foyer, and tickets are checked and stubs torn off, MJ is suiting with a fellow actress in makeup. Half grinning, Peter picks up a bunch and hands over some money. The florist taps him on the shoulder, takes the flowers and hands him back a single stem with three flowers on it. Backstage. Peter glides serenely along a street on his moped.",
    "689": "Spider-Man and Octavius crash through an office window. Spider-Man pummels Octavius' face. The limbs grab Spider-Man's head and toss him about. Both men fall out of the window. The material of Aunt May's brolly starts to tear. She slips down on it. Octavius tosses Spider-Man across the street into a window in the block opposite. Aunt May slips further down the brolly. Aunt May's feet land on a ledge. She looks way down to the ground, then up at the face of the statue whose outstretched arms she'd hooked her brolly around. She's lifted off the ledge. Spider-Man sticks two webs to the window frames and stretches them back like a catapult. As Spider-Man launches himself through the air, a pincer on one of the limbs becomes a pointed spear. Octavius stretches out the spear-like limb towards Spider-Man. Aunt May smacks Octavius on the head with her brolly. Spider-Man grabs the limb. Octavius releases Aunt May. Spider-Man dives to her rescue. He catches her, and they swoop and swing down the street. The police fire at Octavius. Bags of money in one pincer, he disappears around the corner of the building. Spider-Man lands with Aunt May. Spider-Man cocks his head, then leaps up on a web. Girls flock to Aunt May. Firing webs as he goes, the costumed hero sweeps through the skies from building to building across New York City. The planetarium with its suspended glass curtain wall stands 95 foot high. Inside it, a sphere constructed of fabricated aluminum panels. Peter is in the crowded planetarium. He reaches for food. Someone grabs the last canope from a waitress's tray. A couple walks by. He raises his camera. Realizing the lens cap is still on, Peter removes it. Of which time, the couple have walked away. Harry's poured a drink. Snatching the bottle, Harry knocks over his glass. Peter walks up to him. The two old friends stare defiantly at each other. The Mayor glares. All heads turn to look at the stairway down into the planetarium. Captain Jameson is in uniform. A young lady walks beside him arm-in-arm. Everyone applauds, except Peter who sees the young lady is MJ in a black strapless dress, her hair tied up. MJ stares at Peter and turns her head away. He gazes, mesmerized. Later, Peter makes his way out onto the balcony. A server has a tray with one canope on it. He reaches for it as someone else whisks it away. Peter sees MJ alone. He pauses, then walks up behind her. MJ turns to face him. Peter gulps. His eyes fill up. He watches forlornly as MJ strides away from him. A waitress passes. Peter grabs a cocktail glass.",

A moment of silence as DANTE'S chuckles fade to comprehension. DANTE waits on a customer in the interim. She counts silently, using fingers as marks. VERONICA stops counting. DANTE chases VERONICA down and grabs her by the door. She exits in a huff. VERONICA violently lets go of him. VERONICA went. Then he swings the door open and yells out. Two men who were walking in the opposite direction outside double back and head in the direction. DANTE stands there in silence for a moment. A videocassette encased in the customary black box flips repeatedly, held by an impatient grasp. It's twenty after. He should be here soon. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER glares at DANTE. Dante studies a copy of Paradise Lost, making a strong attempt at not noticing the glare. He storms out. Dante lifts a ring of keys from the counter. The half-filled trash can swallows the ring of keys. A hapless RANDAL drifts by and stops. He glances at the door, peers inside, and gives the door a tug. Another VIDEO-ANXIOUS CUSTOMER leans against the video store door. RANDAL walks away. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stands like a sentry at post. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER storms up. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stops RANDAL. A pile of videocassettes is plopped onto the counter, with a single key on top. RANDAL marches off. RANDAL balances the pile of tapes on his head. The IMPATIENT CUSTOMER stares after him. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER now sits on the ground, next to the video store door. RANDAL balances his burden and shoves the key into the lock. The VERY ANXIOUS CUSTOMER stares as RANDAL enters the store. The door closes behind him, only to be held ajar in a gentlemanly fashion a few moments later. RANDAL smiles. We've seen this same routine before. A coffee filter is shoved into the metal pan and someone heaps ground coffee on it. DANTE crosses back to his post, as RANDAL enters, tossing the key into the air happily and catching it. He picks the cat up. He walks by a row of snacks and grabs one without looking at it. He holds a list in his hand. DANTE sits in his seat behind the register. RANDAL grabs a paper and joins him behind the counter. THE HEADLINE of the engagement announcement reads, BREE TO. RANDAL dials the phone. A CUSTOMER comes to the counter and waits. He looks at the litter box. A black cat suddenly jumps into it and starts pawing around. The CUSTOMER watches as the cat takes a huge dump, leaning on its haunches to accommodate the stinky load.",
    "690": "A burst of light reveals a woman dressed in a white classical robe with a blue still draped over her arm standing on top of a shallow pyramid of steps holding a blazing torch high in her right hand. Pages from a superhero comic book flick rapidly down the screen. A spinning war vortex of blue light becomes a silver blue spider's web which scatters the words the opening credits. More splinted images reveal earlier moments in the story. A spider biting Peter Parker. Peter's look of disbelief at his changing physique in a mirror watched by Uncle Ben and Aunt May. Peter having fun with red headed Mary Jane and crawling up a wall like a spider. Uncle Ben's wise, kindly face. Spider-Man in his skintight red and blue webbed suit swings lively from thread to thread like a trapeze artist. More credits appear and blow away as if made of sand. A tangle of sinister black, sticky, tendrils crawl across everything in their path. On a street, Peter Parker rips open his shirt to reveal the Spider-Man suit beneath. Mary Jane in a long white dress looks reproachfully at Peter in the final fractured image. The broken mirror pieces slot together, becoming the blue sky above New York City. Spider-Man swings through the air, high above the city streets. Peter rides his small moped. A student aims a peashooter at Peter's neck. A blonde hottie. Gwen Stacy smiles at Peter. Another student shines a light in Peter's face. Peter steps up to the ticket window. He makes his way to his seat. As he sits down in the center of the front row a couple of large men sit on either side of him. The lights go down. The curtains open, revealing a starry backdrop. Mary Jane descends a staircase wearing a glamorous, long, white dress. Peter grins proudly and mouths the lyrics. In a balcony seat to the side of the auditorium, dark haired Harry Osborne is watching Mary Jane through opera glasses. He lowers the glasses, then his gaze settles on Peter sitting below him in the stalls. Peter, lost in Mary Jane's performance, is totally unaware of Harry's malevolent stare. Following a couple of young women out of the theater, Peter grins with pleasure. He spots someone up ahead. Harry slowly turns to face him. Harry gets into the back of his chauffeur driven limo and is driven away, leaving Peter standing helplessly on the pavement. In Mary Jane's dressing room. Mary Jane smiles warmly. Peter beams happily. In the Goblin Lair at the Osborne mansion several incarnations of the demonic Green Goblin mask are displayed on stands along with a number of high tech weapons and futuristic flying equipment.",
    "693": "Black-suited Spider-Man watches pitilessly. Flint crumbles to nothing and washes away. Later, changed out of the Spider-Man suit, Peter walks through a dilapidated breeze block building, stopping to glance in a chipped mirror. He tugs down his floppy forelock and stares intently at his reflection. His forehead puckered into a frown, his eyes fierce. Outside his digs, his landlord is mopping the floor. Peter glances at his landlord's daughter, watching from a doorway. The young woman comes up to her father. In his flat, Peter closes the French windows to the small balcony and paces restlessly. He examines his reflection in a mirror. He unbuttons the front of his shirt. Underneath, he glimpses the top of the black spider suit with its gray web and spider emblem. He looks down at it uncertainly, his eyes wide and tinged with fear. He tosses the black suit back into the trunk and backs away from it wearily. Later, he visits Aunt May. She looks into his eyes. Peter blinks uncertainly. Peter's expression wavers. He glances at Aunt May's kindly face. Later, Mary Jane steps out of the doorway of a jazz restaurant. Its blue and red neon sign not yet switched on for business, offers nightly music, food, drink, and dancing. With a glum expression, she gazes out into the gray daylight, pulls her coat collar around her neck, and heads away down the street. Walking along the crowded pavement, Mary Jane looks wretched and alone. She slumps down onto a bench and calls up a dial list on her mobile, highlighting the name Peter Parker, then hesitates and scrolls up to Harry Osborne. Harry is expertly painting a still life. Peter picks up a payphone in the hallway outside his room. He drops a coin in the slot, sighs, and hangs up. His landlord steps out of his flat, peeling an orange. Peter looks at him searchingly. The landlord's eyes widened. Father and daughter go into their flat. The daughter peeps back out and waves. At the top of the Osborne luxury apartment building, lift doors open into palatial wood panel penthouse. Harry is waiting for Mary Jane. She takes a deep unhappy breath. Harry gets busy in the kitchen. He spoons chopped peppers into one pan, melts butter in another, and turns up the music with a remote. Grinning cheerfully, he looks over his shoulder at Mary Jane chopping vegetables on the simple kitchen table. She grins back at him and starts to dance the twist. Harry smiles at her. She tries to get him to join in. She drags him away from the stove. He joins in. Bending his knees as he crouches lower and lower, behind him the pan starts to smoke.",
    "696": "Peter takes a cookie. Peter pulls a face and drinks his glass of milk. Later, he struts and jives down the street like one of John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever. The slender Black woman passing by gives him a pitying glance. In Jameson's office, he stands very close to Betty. Peter sneers. Peter sits in Jameson's chair, helps himself to a bowl of sweets and puts his feet up on the desk with a supercilious smile. Robbie and Jameson looked at him dumbfounded. Out on the street, Peter jives down the road, making shooting gestures with his fingers at any pretty girl who walks by. He swaggers into a clothes shop and comes out wearing a sharp black suit and black open neck shirt. On the pavement, he launches into another hip-thrusting '80s dance routine. People on the street give him strange looks and hurry on by. He sorters coolly away. On the outskirts of the city water from a sewer outfall drops into a pond, a line of bubbles cleave the water, leaving a trail behind. A muddy figure made of sand materializes on the swampy bank and hauls itself upright. Drying out and becoming human, Flint stares at his hands, dangling from his fingers as the locket and chain with Penny's photograph. He gazes at the tiny image. His eyes filled with resolve. Peter is with Gwen. Brock watches bitterly as they cross the street towards the jazz club. Gwen looks around. Peter spots Mary Jane waitressing. Peter beckons the hostess and slips her a wad of money. Peter gallantly gestures for her to sit down. He sits behind her, facing the on-stage back. Mary Jane goes by with a tray of drinks. Gwen notices Peter glance at her. Mary Jane puts down her tray and hurries up onto the stage. Peter glances at Gwen out of the corner of his eye. He slips away to the stage. Just as Mary Jane is about to sing, he comes in on piano. Gwen looks up and realizes it's Peter playing the piano. He kicks away the stool, leaps onto the piano, and dances over the tables. Grabbing a martini from a customer, Peter swings across the room on a chandelier, puts his legs around the chair, and slides back across the dance floor, scattering customers. He drops to the floor, spins the chair, and poses with it. He dances towards Gwen and rips his black suit jacket off his shoulders. She gasps. He tosses the jacket towards Mary Jane on stage and strikes a series of poses. Clicking his fingers, he salsas over to Gwen holding out his hand. She takes it and rises to her feet. Mary Jane looks devastated as he leads Gwen into the center of the dance floor.",
    "697": "They start to dance slowly, their faces close together. Peter suddenly throws in a fancy move. Gwen throws her head back. Peter puts his hand on her thigh and raises her leg. As the number ends, he bends her over in his arms. Peter's cold black eyes settled on Mary Jane who looks devastated. Gwen follows his gaze and turns to him in shock. She gives Peter a reproving look and crosses to Mary Jane who's standing motionless behind the microphone. Gwen pushes her way past Peter. Mary Jane hurries from the stage. Peter, looking uncertain, puts his hand to his chest. He comes up behind Mary Jane with a hostile scowl. She turns to face him with scorn in her eyes. Peter pins a bouncer against the wall and starts beating off two more. He lashes out, sending Mary Jane careering to the floor. His vicious expression turns to wide eyed shock as he realizes what he's done. His eyes well up, then he glances down at the Black Spider-Man suit under his dark open neck shirt. Covering the suit with his hand, he turns away from Mary Jane and hurries out into the night. Mary Jane, still sitting on the floor, looks around helplessly. Out in the rains wet street, Peter, keeping his hand clasped both his collar, steps into a doorway to think. Drawn by the sound of the bells, he looks up at the torrential rain pours down. A flash of lightning illuminates a Gothic church with a tall studded aspire topped by a stone crucifix. The storm clouds slowly drift away, leaving a lowering gray sky. Perch tie up on the studded side of the steeple, black-suited Spider-Man looks at his hand, flexes his fist, then drops from his perch like a bird shot from a tree. He plummets down to a square archway, leading to the bell tower of the imposing cathedral, decorated with an intricate network of Gothic arches and flying buttresses. Inside the cathedral, Eddie Brock dips his fingers in a font of holy water and crosses himself before the altar. Up in the bell tower, Spider-Man claws at his mask, desperately trying to tear it off. It tears and stretches like rubber then snaps back like a second skin. He falls against the bell in a struggle. For a second, the mask seems to disintegrate then snaps back into place. Brock looks up at the sound. Peter pulls up the mask, ripping it across his contorted features. The black threads of the Symbiote sticking to his face like bulging veins. As if in a trance, Brock is drawn to the screams of his nemesis, pushing open a door that leads to a staircase winding around the walls of the bell tower.",
    "7": "The Colonel looks coldly down at us from Ricky's bedroom window, and then he pulls the drapes shut. Cars ZOOM past in the rain. Carolyn sits behind the wheel, listening to a MOTIVATIONAL TAPE on the STEREO. Carolyn leans over and opens the glove compartment. She takes out her GLOCK. Jane stands across the room from her. Angela is sprawled across the bed. There is a KNOCK on the door. Jane jumps up and opens the door and lets him in. Angela stares at him, stunned, then starts toward the door. And she exits, SLAMMING the door behind her. Jane turns to Ricky and he takes her in his arms. Angela sits on the stairs, shaken, crying. We're MOVING SLOWLY toward the Burnham's GARAGE WINDOW through the RAIN. Through the window, we see Lester, wearing only his sweatpants, performing bench presses. Through the window, we see the Colonel standing outside, watching. We ZOOM slowly in on him as he watches, transfixed. Lester finishes his last rep, then racks the weights and sits up, sweaty and out of breath. And then he glances at us, suddenly aware he's being watched. Lester and the Colonel stare at each other through the window. We're directly outside the GARAGE DOOR as it slowly lifts to reveal Lester smiling at us. The RAIN is coming down in sheets now, and there is a sharp CLAP of THUNDER. The Colonel moves stiffly and seems preoccupied, slightly disoriented. The Colonel just stands there, looking at Lester. The Colonel moves closer towards him. He grins and so does the Colonel. He places his hand on the Colonel's shoulder. The Colonel closes his eyes and then kisses him. Lester is momentarily stunned, and then he pushes the Colonel away. The Colonel's face crumples in shame. The Colonel stares at the floor, blinking, and then he turns and runs out the open garage door into the rainy night. Carolyn is still listening to the same MOTIVATIONAL TAPE. She holds the GLOCK in her hand. Carolyn switches the TAPE OFF and puts the gun in her purse. The Mercedes pulls away from the shoulder. Lester enters, opens the refrigerator and grabs a BEER. Lester opens his beer and starts toward the family room. Lester leans against the wall and takes a swig of his beer. AS we MOVE SLOWLY around a corner, Angela comes into view, standing at the STEREO, holding a CD case. She's been crying; her face is puffy, and her hair mussed. She regards us apprehensively then puts on a slightly defiant smile. She smiles. Lester holds the bottle up to her mouth and she drinks clumsily. He gently wipes her chin with the back of his hand.",
    "70": "DANTE hangs up. He looks at the paper ruefully, shaking his head. He then sniffs the air. JAY, SILENT BOB and OLAF lean against wall. OLAF looks quizzically at SILENT BOB. OLAF looks the girls up and down. OLAF makes a metal face. OLAF laughs and shakes his head. OLAF busts a crimson metal sneer and cackles deeply. The theme to Star Wars plays. RANDAL leans back in his chair, staring up at the TV. He stands, points the remote, clicks the TV off, and ponders. RANDAL locks the door and walks away, while OLAF sings for the small crowd. The can pops off and DANTE staggers back a few steps. The man rubs his hand. The MAN exits as RANDAL enters. DANTE throws the canister away. RANDAL follows DANTE as he cleans up around the store. DANTE steps behind the counter. The BLUE-COLLAR MAN joins them. The BLUE-COLLAR MAN exits. DANTE and RANDAL remain respectfully quiet for a moment. RANDAL hardly stirs and continues to read his paper. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER wears a face that belies utter disbelief in the audacity of this most lackadaisical video clerk. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER is a tad flabbergasted, but not put off. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER smirks smugly at RANDAL and his paper. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER half turns to see if her comment was even heard. She tries again, but this time with a different approach. RANDAL continues to read his paper, not looking up. RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER tries harder, then louder and more direct. RANDAL continues to read. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER holds up her rental choices. RANDAL, as always, reads on. The INDECISIVE CUSTOMER shakes her head in disgust and throws the movies back onto the wall. An angry WOMAN opens the door. She storms out. He hops over the counter and whips the door open. RANDAL is offended. RANDAL closes the door and stands there, momentarily, totally appalled by her exiting remark, then shakes his head. He reaches behind the counter and grabs a ring of keys. Exiting, he locks the door behind him from the outside, gives it a tug to ensure its security, and storms off in the opposite direction from the woman. DANTE is staring, open-mouthed, at something O.C. RANDAL hurls the door open and immediately launches into his tirade. An ODD MAN sits on the floor, surrounded by cartons of eggs, all opened. The ODD MAN holds an egg up to the light and studies it from several different angles. He grabs a carton from the cooler case, pops it open, and examines each egg carefully. RANDAL snickers at his friend. RANDAL and DANTE study the O.C. oddity. The ODD MAN is spinning an egg on the floor.",
    "700": "Peter frees himself and punctures Venom. They fall off the web and plummet down the side of the skyscraper as they're falling down the lift shaft, trading kicks and blows as they go. Peter tries to pull his mask back on but drops it as he fires a thread just as he's about to hit the ground. He lands in a deserted construction site, his suit ripped and torn. He retrieves his mask then looks up sharply as the truck starts dropping towards the cab. Mary Jane leaps out of the cab just before the truck hits it and clings to the web. The sandy ground shakes, knocking Spider Man over as if a rug is being pulled from under him. Out of a moving mountain of sand Sandman rises to his feet, towering over the cowering crowd like a colossus. The crowd scatters as the huge, hulking, King Kong-like figure slams a car sized fist into the ground, narrowly missing Spiderman, who looks up at Mary Jane, clinging onto the web. Spider-Man dodges being squashed like a bug beneath Sandman's truck sized foot. He whizzes past the giant beast on threads, with Sandman swatting at him as if he was a fly. Mary Jane loses her grip, landing on the lower section of webs splayed out like a sacrificial victim. She watches Spider-Man hurtling towards her. Venom leaps out at Spider-Man, knocking him into column of girders that he bounces against as he falls. He lands on a horizontal girder and turns to face Sandman, who slowly pulls himself up to his full height and towers over him like an elephant looking down on a mouse. Standing beneath the girder, Venom fires a thread down Spider-Man's neck and pulls him onto his back, garroting him as Sandman brings his fist down like a steam hammer. Spider-Man desperately reaches out a hand as he tries to free himself. The web holding the cab above Mary Jane starts to break as Spider-Man is pummeled by Sandman's fist. His mask torn. Peter stretched out his hand towards Mary Jane. She looks down helplessly as Sandman smashes his fist down on Peter, whose hand hangs limply at his side. Sandman rear up for another blow. A pumpkin bomb, which to Sandman is the size of a pimple, is fired into the side of his head. Half of Sandman's head is blown away, and what's left of it looks like a bowl of burning coals. A searchlight picks out the new goblin gliding through the air on his sky stick. He sends Venom flying through some walls with a flick of his sky stick. His mask peeling back to reveal Harry's disfigured face, he glides up alongside battered Peter.",
    "701": "A screen shows a scan of a human body. Next to it, a high tech hoverboard. The door of a glass chamber slides open and green smoke pours out. Harry, wearing just a pair of shorts, steps out of the chamber. He takes a deep breath and smirks. In a dark, peaceful forest, Peter and Mary Jane, lying on a huge hammock-like web on their backs, are watching for shooting stars. Mary Jane shuts her eyes very tightly, and a faint smile falls across her face. She smiles, and they kiss tenderly. A fiery meteor plummets from the sky and smacks down in the forest. Mary Jane and Peter, wrapped in each other's arms, are oblivious to it. The glowing orange meteor embedded in the ground cracks open. Black tendrils, like living vines, spring out of it and stretch across the ground. Peter, smiling happily, slides down a thread of webbing with Mary Jane, unaware of the tendrils crawling up a nearby ridge like a huge black spider. Peter wraps his moped. With Mary Jane sitting on the pillion seat, it starts to move off. The strange black substance crawls speedily up behind and attaches itself to the rear number plate, as the moped rides off down the woodland track. At night, a train rumbles across a bridge in the heart of Brooklyn. Close by, a burly fair-haired man in an orange jumpsuit runs down a dark street. A police car with a search lamp mounted by the passenger window turns onto the street behind him and drives down the road at a walking pace. The man, Flint Marko, hides in the shadows and watches nervously as the squad car cruises past. Flint grabs the bottom rungs of a metal ladder mounted on a wall. He holds himself up and climbs the ladder to a fire escape outside a bedroom window. Gently, he opens the window and climbs into the dark bedroom. He looks down at a little girl of about 10 years old asleep in bed. She has a tube connected to her nose. Flint sits down on the window sill as he gazes at her intently. He reaches into his jumpsuit and takes out a handful of letters addressed to Penny Marko. Flint reaches over and gently slides the letters underneath Penny's pillow. He pulls open in a drawer and takes out a green-and-black- striped T-shirt. In the dark kitchen, he breaks some bread in half. He turns sharply as the light comes on and looks at a blond woman in her 40s with her arms folded, wearing a disenchanted expression. They both turn to the door. Penny, who's overheard, comes in. Flint walks over to her, kneels down in front of her, and gently takes her arm.",
    "705": "Harry banks around and sees Peter swinging between the buildings. He zooms down after Peter, who swings into a narrow gap between the tall buildings, propelling himself along from thread to thread. Harry turns the Sky Stick side on so he can fly along the narrow gap, dodging fire escapes and air con units as he air boards after Peter. Harry pulls a glowing green sword from a scabbard on his back and slashes wildly at Peter, who swerves out of the way. Harry soars above Peter, then plummets down to stab him but misses. Harry hurls a small, golden pumpkin bomb at Peter. Opens up in mid-air into a kind of flying metallic bat. Harry throws more bombs at Peter. They slash at Peter who desperately tries to swing out of their way. He jumps off a pipe and swings back the way he came, just missing Harry. The winged bombs surge after Peter and Harry gets caught in the swarm. One of them embeds its wing in his shoulder. He yanks it out, zooms upwards into the air, and swoops on after Peter. Peter swings backwards, shooting webbing at the bombs and disabling them. One of them, in a thread, and swings it back at Harry. Harry flies through the explosion, shielding his eyes. He hits the line of thread stretched out in front of him and bounces off a pipe and a wall, tumbling towards an alleyway below. Peter, his eyes widening with alarm, swings down towards him. Harry lies motionless on the ground. He hurries over to his unconscious old friend. Peter crouches down and holds his ear to Harry's mouth. He yanks open Harry's dark green jacket and starts pumping his chest. He listens again for signs of life. He carries his friend to an emergency room. Peter watches through a window as a crash team try to revive Harry. A detective hands a file to tall, thin faced Captain Stacy. A police dog handler blows a whistle and points. Flint sprints across waste ground with armed officers running behind him. As he reaches a wire mesh fence an Alsatian lunges at him. He wrestles the dog off and punches it away. Flint climbs. Flint runs on and suddenly falls into a huge pit. Flint tumbles down a concrete wall and lands heavily on a pile of sand in the bottom of the pit. Slowly, he hauls himself to his feet and looks desperately from side to side. He's caught in a dazzling beam of light. Above the pit, three glowing capacitors begin to rotate like a merry-go-round. Flint looks up nervously as the capacitors descent towards him and spin around him. They kick up a sandstorm with Flint trapped in the middle.",
    "709": "As pedestrians scatter, one of the cops stops along the side of the lorry with his gun drawn. He looks up and sees the tarpaulin rippling. He gestures to his partner, who holsters his gun and climbs a ladder on the back of the lorry. He unfastens one of the ropes attached to the tarpaulin. The tarpaulin flies off to reveal a cargo of tightly-packed sand. The cop at the back of the lorry makes his way across the sand with a shovel. He stops and raises the shovel like a spear. Sand pushed the cop off the lorry onto the windscreen of a car. A huge wave of sand spreads across the top of the lorry and forms into a gigantic hand which crumbles on the police gun fight. Sandman rises up like a walking giant as a group of cops take aim. As bits of Sandman crumble away in the gunfire, he sweeps down at the cops bursts in a bucket of sand blocking cars over as if they were toys. At the key of the city ceremony, Gwen Stacy is at the lectern flanked by city dignitaries. Photographers turn away from the stage pointing their lenses to the sky as red and blue balloons are released and Spider- Man comes swinging through the crowd, high-fiving them as sweeps past on a thread. He perches on top of the stage. He glides onto the stage upside down. As Spider-Man hangs upside down in front of her, Gwen peels back his mask, exposing his mouth and plants a passionate kiss on him. Mary Jane looks on in shock. She walks off. Everyone looks up as a string of sand whizzes past like an express train. Elsewhere in the city, security guards load up an armored van with cash bags. As the van doors are closed the sandstorm zooms in like a swarm of angry bees. The guard driving looks at the shadow alongside the van as the mass of sand forms into a human shape standing on the roof. Sandman punches a hole on the roof and board inside, overwhelming the guards with a torrent of sand. The weight of the sand presses the accelerator on the van, picks up speed. Flint is zipping up a bag of cash as Spider-Man drops through the hole in the roof of the van behind him. Spider-Man dodges a couple of punches then puts his fist through Flint's stomach. Flint's sandy fist swells to a huge size. He punches Spider-Man through the back of the van, ripping the door off. Spider-Man fires a thread at the runaway van, leaps onto the torn off door, and he's dragged along like a water scare as he dodges cars.",
    "711": "In animation, city lights glow behind giant letters sitting on a cliff surrounded by shining spotlights. In sepia tone film footage, people wearing early 20th century clothing stand on a dock and wave toward a massive ocean liner, the RMS Titanic. Passengers on board the moored ships doff their hats or wave to the people below. Surrounded by inky darkness, a pair of small bluish white lights glow. The lights grow brighter as two objects approach. Now revealed to be deep sea submersives. The two subs disappear as they sink into the dark ocean depths. Later, the subs creep just above the ocean floor. Their lights illuminated a small expansive pale sand. A triangular shape appears on a sonar screen. Ahead of the submersible, a prowl of the sunken ocean liner looms up. A brown-haired man cranes his neck, as he stares out of one of the submersible portals. One sub rises over the tapered bow and railing. Which are covered in a growth resembling drippy, gray concrete. The sub's bright light shine over a thick chain lying accross a ship's deck. The sub moves forward stirring up clouds of sediment as the second sub follows close behind. A brown-haired man films himself with a camcorder as he stares out the window at the wreck. The man smiles at a bearded crew mate. Both subs glide of the wreck and illuminate twisted metal shapes encrusted with grayish growth. They pass along side upper balconies running down the side of the ship. The man sets down his camcorder as the subs descend toward the wreck. Lights illuminate rectangular windows with panes of broken glass. A crewman operates a remote control with a joystick. Outside a small robotic vehicle attached to a tether engages from the sub. Duncan enters a hole in the side of the haul and films a door with an ornate leaded glass window. Powered by a small propeller, Duncan glides past the door. Outside, the other sub releases a second remotely operated vehicle. Snoop Dog descends into an open pit in the ship's hull. Snoop Dog moves through an opening. Its bright lights illuminate a crystal chandelier, still dangling from a ceiling. Snoop Dog glides up a corridor. A partially decayed boot lies on the sediment beside a pair of eyeglasses missing one lens. Nearby, a porcelain doll's face juts out of the silt. Snoop Dog's lamps shine into a bunk room. A broken door lies on the floor beside a dilapidated bed frame. The bearded crewman stares into a visor as he pilots Snoop Dog through. A pale eel slithers through the water as Snoop Dog approaches an elaborately carved fireplace surround and a mantel. One of the robotic explorer shines its lights on the rotted remains of a grand piano.",
    "722": "Snoop Dog glides into a room. The remains of a wooden bed lie collapsed on the floor. Another eel swims past a porcelain bathtub. Snoop Dog pivots toward a broken door lying in the silt. The bearded man grasps the two joysticks as Snoop Dog extends a pair of mechanical claws. Snoop Dog moves the door aside and uncovers a square object. The brown-haired man squints as he studies a video monitor. The silt settles, revealing an unopened safe. On the ocean surface, a research vessel outfitted with cranes plucks the submersibles out of the water. Men cheer as a winch raises a net holding the safe to the surface. Lewis uncorks a bottle of champagne and sprays everyone as a crewman opens the safe with a cutting wheel. A man pulls off the door, unleashing a flood of muddy water. As a cameraman films him, Brock kneels and pulls out wads of sodden papers. He removes a muddy ledger, which he tosses aside. Brow furrowed, he empties the safe. Scowling at the safe, Brock stands. Later, Brock takes a phone call. Nearby lab techs clean the muddy papers, revealing a sketch of a woman. Reclining on a settee, the naked woman wears a large pendant around her neck. Brock studies a photograph of a pendant necklace with a heart-shaped gem. The same necklace the woman in the drawing is wearing. Elsewhere, in a home, a young, long-haired woman walks past a small dog as she carries teacups to a table. In an adjoining sunroom, a white-haired woman uses a pottery wheel. Leaning on a cane, the older woman steps toward a small television set in a nearby kitchen. Brock stands on the research area. Brock uses a satellite phone. Holding the small white dog on her lap, Rose and the young woman ride inside a helicopter as it flies out to the research ship. Brock and Lewis move to a railing as the helicopter approaches. They moved towards the Landing pad as the helicopter touches down. Crewman unloads several suitcases and a large trunk. Rose shakes Brock's hand. The long haired woman smiles and pushes Rose away in a wheelchair. A man aboard the helicopter hands a fishbowl to Brock. Later, Rose sets framed photographs beside the fishbowl. In the lab, Rose peers down at the clean sketch which rests in a container of clear liquid. She closes her eyes. A blonde man with a few stray locks over his eyes sketches the drawing. Rose smiles as she picks up the silver hand mirror. Rose turns the mirror in her hands, catching her own reflection in the cracked glass. She sets down the mirror and examines other objects. She picks up a silver and glass hair comb adorned with an ornamental insect with outstretched wings.",
    "724": "Cal steps on a piece of broken banister and falls. He stands, picks up the gun, and runs after them. Jack and Rose run to the bottom of the staircase. Cal aims but doesn't fire. He knocks a man out of his way, then shoots again. Jack and Rose run down another staircase, then jump into waist-high water. Cal runs into the water. Jack and Rose hurry into the dining room. Cal aims, but the gun is empty. Cal looks around himself at the rising water. Jack and Rose run through the dining room. Cal climbs several steps, then stops. He chuckles to himself as Lovejoy appears. Rose and Jack run down a passageway. They turn, then run down more stairs. Stopping, Jack presses his finger to his mouth. In the dining room, a glass door swings slowly through the water. Small waves push plates and silverware, as rising water covers the tables and chairs. Rose and Jack step into another passageway. At the far end, a small boy stands against a wall. Water pours down the steps, and then they run towards the boy. Sparks shoot from an overhead pipe. Jack picks up the boy, then watches as water shoots in from cracks. They turn and run back up the passageway. They stop as water rushes into the passageway ahead of them. As they run in the opposite direction, a man, the boy's father, steps into the hall. The man grabs the boy from Jack, then knocks Jack against a wall. The man runs off with the boy, and Jack and Rose run after him. The man picks up a suitcase, then gapes at the door, which bursts. Water rushes in, knocking the man over. Water rushes after them as they run down the passageway. A wave knocks them over, and rushing water carries them away. Water pours around them as lights flicker. Jack struggles against the current toward a stairwell. They pull themselves along a wall toward the stairwell. Jack pushes Rose through the shoulder-high water toward the railing. Rose grabs the railings and climbs to another locked gate. Jack shakes the gate as the water rises below them. The water reaches their feet. A steward runs past them. The steward returns for them. He tries several keys in the lock, as water swirls around them. The water reaches their thighs. Sparks shoot nearby. The steward fumbles with the keys and then drops underwater. Holding onto the grate with one hand, he reaches for the keys. Jack grabs the keys, then resurfaces. Jack reaches around the grate with the key, but misses the lock. He slips the key into the lock. He turns the key. Rose opens the gate.",
    "728": "Stacks of plates slide off the shelves and smash on the floor. A life boat flows people away from the part of the ship which rises several stories into night sky. People slide down the slanted deck. Jack's eyes widen as he watches people and deck chairs smashed with each other. A brunette woman slips out of a man's grasp and slides on the deck on her stomach. All along the Titanic people dangle from ropes, spill from railings or slide down into the ocean. More people climb over the railing at the back of the ship. One man jumps and free falls into the icy water where small groups of survivors cling to floating debris. Standing at the rear railing, the black haired baker watches a falling man bounce off of one of the giant propellers and cartwheel into the sea. The baker pulls a flask out of his pocket and takes a drink. Jack wraps his arms around Rose as she grips onto the railing. Sitting beside Molly in a lifeboat, Ruth's eyes are glassy as she watches from a distance. Also in a lifeboat Ismay turns away from the carnage and squeezes his eyes shut. A crewman reaches towards a sparking circuit breaker. A shock flings him. All along the Titanic electric lights flicker then go out. As the rear of the ship continues to tilled upward. Blood streaming down his forehead, Lovejoy grips a side railing as it splits apart. Inside the ship a ceiling collapses as several support columns failed. Small explosions shoot flames from portholes. A pair of men slides into the widening chasm. The mighty ship snaps in half, sending the rear of the boat plunging back toward the sea. The back of the Titanic slaps down on the ocean surface crushing dozens. The last of the funnels topples over as water rushes into the gap between the two sections, which are still joined at the bottom. The Titanic rapidly fills with water and sinks. Jack climbs over the railing at the back of the ship as it tilled sky over rapidly. Passengers manage to scramble over the railing. Sheets of water grimmer in the moon light which rises up from the ocean. People dangling from railings lose their grips and fall. One man bounces off a cab stand before slamming into other people hanging on below, creating a domino effect of falling bodies. A blonde maid dangles from the railing near Rose, who looks into the young woman's eyes as she loses her grip and falls. Her breath visible in the cold air, Rose turns toward the baker who crouches on the railing beside her. He returns her silent gaze. The entire ship sinks.",
    "729": "Air pressure blows water out of compartments. The ocean roils around the ship as it sinks deeper. Dozens of passengers still dangle from poles or lie against railings and staircases. Jack keeps one arm wrapped around Rose as they descend toward the water. One man slips off a pole and spins as he bounces off a railing. Some people behind the ship try to swim as the massive propellers sink below the surface. Jack and Rose hold hands as they kneel beside one another. Rose nods as the bubbling water covers the tail rudder and surges up the whole deck. Waves swell around the name Titanic and across the ship. Deep gulps of air as the tail end of the ship sinks beneath the surface. Under water, Jack and Rose hold hands as they tumble in the jostling current. The ship sinks and vanishes. Jack grabs onto Rose's life vest but is swept away by the turbulence. Rose kicks to the surface and emerges amid other flailing survivors. For at least a quarter mile the ocean churns with panicked swimmers. Out of their grasps, one man grabs onto Rose and shoves her underwater as he tries to climb on top of her. Jack punches the hysterical man in the face until he releases Rose. Jack pulls Rose by her life vest. They swim out of the mass of survivors. Jack leads her to a flat piece of wood floating on the surface. Rose pulls herself onto the elaborately carved panel. Jack tries to pull himself onto the panel as well, but it tips under their combined weight. Jack holds onto the panel as he floats in the water beside her. Jack looks down, then blinks and nods to himself. Lying on her stomach on the panel, Rose moves toward Jack and leans her forehead against his face. Their breath is visible in the cold air. He takes her hand. Clinging to a nearby piece of debris, a crewman blows into a whistle. Rose's blue lips tremble as she smiles weakly. Sitting in a lifeboat beside Molly, Ruth closes her eyes. Furrowing her brow, Molly looks around at the other people in the boat who avert their gaze. A young woman sobs. Molly glares at the crewman then sits. Beside her Ruth presses hands over her own ears. Elsewhere, survivors in four lifeboats work to lash the vessels together. A dark haired crewman supervising the operation glances back toward the site of the wreck. Still clinging to wreckage, the crewman with the whistle in his mouth floats motionless with his eyes closed. Swimming a few yards away, Jack stares at the man, then turns toward Rose. Rose's lips tremble as she stares at Jack.",
    "73": "JAY deals with a customer as SILENT BOB looks on. The two exit. DANTE, alone, studies his summons. He rubs his forehead. DANTE spins, angrily. His expression softens. DANTE hops behind the counter. A customer pays for something while DANTE continues to talk. Another customer comes to the counter. Yet another customer comes to the counter. JAY and SILENT BOB lean against the wall. She kisses his forehead and walks away. She heads toward the back. DANTE watches her leave. DANTE looks ahead, dreamily, half-spinning in his chair. He then explodes in jubilance. RANDAL enters carrying videos. DANTE hands him the summons. RANDAL reads it. The cooler door is heard opening. DANTE and RANDAL regard her curiously. She looks very satisfied. CAITLIN walks lazily down the convenience store aisle. DANTE is bewildered. She joins them, latching on to DANTE's arm, lovingly. RANDAL and DANTE stare at CAITLIN, confused. Everyone is silent. The same OLD MAN who took a porn mag to the bathroom. THE OLD MAN'S FACE is serene, almost happy, as he lies on a stretcher. The body bag zipper is pulled closed. DANTE, the CORONER, and RANDAL stand around the stretcher-bound body bag. It is an erection. Midway down the body bag, something protrudes, pushing the bag up. The CORONER takes notes. RANDAL stares at it. Ambulance attendants join them. The stretcher is wheeled out. The CORONER stares at DANTE. RANDAL and the CORONER stare in disbelief. RANDAL looks down, anonymously. DANTE and RANDAL stare at the floor. DANTE says nothing. DANTE says even less than nothing. RANDAL hops off the freezer case and steps out of camera. He exits. RANDAL comes back. DANTE crosses out of camera. DANTE repairs ripped dollar bills, taping them back together. JAY enters with SILENT BOB and claps his hands. Exit JAY. SILENT BOB stands there. SILENT BOB leaves. DANTE shuts his eyes tightly and rubs the bridge of his nose with his thumb and forefinger, as if in deep concentration. He suddenly snaps his eyes open. RANDAL has a heart-to-heart with VERONICA. VERONICA stares, dumbfounded. VERONICA exits. DANTE lies on the floor alone. RANDAL exits and locks the door behind him. Tight on RANDAL'S face as he steps inside. Hands clasp around his throat and yank him out of the frame. DANTE throttles RANDAL, choking him to the ground. RANDAL throws his fists into DANTE'S midriff, throwing him back into the magazine rack. RANDAL jumps to his feet as DANTE comes at him again. RANDAL tumbles into the cakes as Entenman's products scatter beneath and around him. He grabs a pound cake and hits DANTE in the head with it, using the opportunity to scurry down the middle aisle. RANDAL grabs Italian bread and smacks it into DANTE'S face as he rushes him blindly.",
    "731": "Below the sky along the horizon, lifeboats row toward a waiting ship anchored amid floating icebergs. Rose opens her eyes as they row up alongside the ship Carpathia. Later, Titanic survivors recover on one of the ships lower decks as nurses and crewmen flit amongst them. Still dressed in a tuxedo, Cal walks down a staircase onto the lower deck. Cal brushes past a man and walks into the survivors. Rose sits on a bench with a blanket wrapped around her, hooding her hair and head. She glances up at Cal's back as he surveys the passengers. Rose looks away as he turns toward her. She closes her eyes as Cal paces behind her. Rose peers sideways at Cal as he walks away. Her hair wet and stringy, Rose stands in pouring rain on the deck of the ship. She stares up at the Statue of Liberty, the torch and crown glowing in the night. A ship's crewman holding a clipboard steps up to Rose. Rose continues to stare up at the giant statue as the crewman moves on. Lizzy smiles. On the ocean floor, the two submersibles shine their lights on the Titanic's remains. The submersibles rise, leaving the wreck and darkness. At the surface, crewmen work to recover the submersibles. Standing with Lizzy on the research, Brock sniffs a cigar, then throws it into the water. Staring at Brock, Lizzy smiles and shakes her head. He turns and watches lights glint off the surface of rolling waves. Later that night, wearing only a nightgown, across the desolate deck, her loose white hair blows in the wind. Clutching her hands over her heart, Rose walks to a railing at the back of the ship. She grips the railing with one hand, and then pulls herself up onto the bottom rung. She stares down into the water. She unclasps her left hand, revealing the Heart of the Ocean. The large heart-shaped blue diamond glints in the moonlight. On the deck of the Carpathia, young Rose stands in the rain and stares at the Statue of Liberty. Frowning, she looks down and pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of her jacket pocket. Back on the deck of the Keldysh, Rose tosses the diamond necklace into the sea. As the necklace sinks, Rose smiles and exhales deeply. The necklace twirls down to the dark ocean depths. Later, Rose sleeps in her berth beside her collection of framed photographs. In one picture, Rose stands beside a large fish. In another, she sits on an elephant's back. In a third, Rose wears a long scarf around her neck as she poses beside a biplane. In another, Rose smiles to stride a horse.",
    "735": "He pulls Rose up. Three nearby sailors turn and run toward Jack. Rose grips the railing with her free hand as Jack holds her up and on to the poop deck as Jack wraps his arms around Rose's torso and lifts her back over the rail. Jack falls on top of Rose as she is spilled onto the deck. The sailors run up to them. One sailor glances at Jack and then at Rose's torn dress. Jack stands and places his hands into his trouser pockets. Later, Rose is wrapped in a blanket as men handcuffed Jack. Jack glances at wide eyed Rose. Cal rubs Rose's arms. Cal strides back to Jack. Rose glances at Jack before leaving with Cal. Jack motions over Cal's brown-haired man servant. He steps up to Jack and holds out a cigarette case. Jack takes two cigarettes, placing one in his mouth and the other behind his left ear. Jack looks down at his unlaced boots. Jack looks down as the man walks off. In her berth, Rose sits at a vanity table and holds her silver hand mirror. She sets down the mirror as Cal opens the door. Cal opens a box containing the heart of the ocean. He fastens the necklace with a blue heart-shaped diamond on Rose. Rose strokes the necklace as she gazes at her own reflection on the vanity mirror. Cal kneels beside Rose. She stares at him. Cal smiles at the blank-faced Rose who blinks then turns and stares at her reflection. She places her right hand over the diamond. Daytime, Jack and Rose walk along in upper deck. Rose holds out her engagement ring. Rose shakes Jack's hand up and down. She releases his hand and walks away. She stares at him with her mouth open. She snatches Jack's sketchbook. Jack sits beside Rose as she flips through his drawings. She studies a sketch of a woman breastfeeding an infant. She turns to a drawing of a nude woman lying on her side with a cigarette on her mouth. Another sketch depicts a nude woman standing against a ballet bar. Rose closes the sketchbook as another passenger walks past. Smiling, Rose turns to his sketch of a nude dark-haired woman lying with one arm stretched over her head. Another drawing of just a pair of hands. Rose looks down open-mouth as Jack flip to another drawing. A fully-clothed middle-aged woman. Rose smiles at Jack. Her smile fades. In a dining room, Ruth sips tea with two other women. Ruth nods at Molly then strides off. Nearby mustached Ismay sits with the captain. Jack takes Rose's hand. He pulled her to a different section of the railing. Jack spits.",
    "737": "The waiter spoons a dollop of black caviar into Jack's dinner plate. Rose smiles. Jack grins at Rose. Molly glares at Ruth. The waiter refills Jack's glass. Jack tosses a box of matches to Cal. Rose raises her glass. They all toast. Jack raises his glass to Rose. Cal lifts his glass, frowns and then sips. Later, a waiter pushes a cart laden with desserts. Jack hands a pen to Molly. Cal lobs the matches back to Jack. He slips them into his pocket, then approaches Rose. Rose smiles. Ruth stares at them. Kissing her hand, Jack slips a note to Rose. He turns and walks off, glancing back at her over his shoulder. As Ruth stares at her daughter, Rose gazes across the room toward the door. Beneath the skylight, Jack stands on the landing and faces the clock. Rose steps to the bottom of the staircase. Lifting her dress slightly, she ascends the stairs. Jack turns. Another play is a set of pipes. Two men swing each other around on the platform as couples dance. Fabrizio dances with a blonde woman, Helga. He places his hand on her back. Jack, now with his tie removed and sleeves rolled up, dances with Cora, a little girl with dark hair. Some people clap their hands in time to the music. Rose sits at a table with blonde Bjorn as Tommy sets down several glasses of beer. Tommy sets a beer in front of Rose. Rose claps her hands as she watches Jack. Nearby, a man falls to the floor. Two other men help him up, while another hands the man his drink. Jack spins Cora as Fabrizio and Helga prance back and forth. He waves rose over. They stand on the dance floor. Jack pulls Rose close. Cora stands watching them. Cora smiles. Jack and Rose dance through the crowd. Fabrizio and Helga climb onto the platform, then dance. Jack and Rose whirl around. Jack pulls arm of the rose and then performs a special dance. Watching him Rose, pulls off her shoes, tosses them to a nearby woman, then holds up the hem of her dress. Jack smiles, claps his hands. When he stops, Rose dances. They link arms and dance in a circle. Other couples dance around them. Jack and Rose hold hands, then face each other and spin faster and faster. In the smoking room, a steward lights Cal's cigar. Others talk or smoke cigars. Tommy and Bjorn arm wrestle as others cheer. Jack steps up to their table and, reaching over Bjorn, grabs two glasses of beer. He hands one glass to Rose, then drinks from his own. Jack watches Rose gulp down most of her beer.",
    "746": "At the Holbrooks', Hilly with her hair in curling clips is scowling at the newspaper. Her eyes shoot up at Yule Mae who is clearing away some dishes. Yule Mae goes towards the kitchen, then stops and puts the plates back down. William and Hilly both lower their newspapers. William glances at his watch. He pecks his wife on the cheek and goes. Yule Mae picks up the plates. With a supercilious smile, Hilly picks up her paper. Chubby faced Sugar who towers above Minnie listens obediently. Sugar gets on the bus leaving Minnie behind. Minnie gets on another bus. He deposits her outside a set of gates and a long drive beyond. Minnie walks up the drive towards an imposing white painted mansion. Celia bursts barefoot through the door with a cheery wave. Minnie walks towards her. Long and slender Celia puts on her stilettos in the hall. Minnie points to a mark on Celia's cheek. She drags Minnie into the state-of-the-art kitchen. Minnie looks at the messy kitchen table. Celia coyly touches her slender waist. Minnie shrugs a yes. Celia hugs her. She ushers Minnie into the house, swigging from a bottle of cola. Celia sinks down on a chair like a naughty child. She swigs some more Coke. At the Holbrooks', Hilly is addressing a meeting of the junior league. Skeeter is sitting near the back. Hilly dismisses Mary Beth with a wave of her hand. Skeeter sits back down with a blind smile. Later, Skeeter pulls up outside Brent's Drug Store Diner and hurries in carrying her briefcase. Elizabeth and Hilly are already sitting in a booth. With a knowing smile Hilly command Elizabeth to budge up. Elizabeth slides a milkshake in front of Skeeter. Hilly's face softens. Hilly and Elizabeth smile conspiratorially. Skeeter gives Hilly a long look. She forces a smile at Elizabeth's enthusiasm. At Hilly's the front lawn is being mowed and Yule Mae is hoovering. She goes to move the sofa away from the wall. Spotting something she reaches down. It's a ring. She looks about her catching her breath and slips it into the pocket of her white apron. At Elizabeth's, Aibileen lays Mae Mobley down to change her nappy. As she unpins the nappy, her face stiffens with displeasure. In her kitchen, she sits facing Skeeter. She fixes Skeeter with a determined expression. Minnie barges in. Seeing Skeeter she puts her hands on her ample hips. Outside she starts to stride away from Aibileen's house, then stops and walks right back inside. Skeeter obediently moves back her chair. Skeeter gawks nervously as Minnie heaves her full round hips onto the table and folds her arms. Skeeter whips off her specs.",
    "756": "David reaches for it, loses it, sees it again, and at the third attempt, grasps it. Above the pole, bright lights shine into the pool. David struggles to the surface, clinging to the pole, lets go of it to claw his fingers over the pool edge. The pole slides away, and David hangs on grimly for a moment before hauling himself out of the water and crawling painfully slowly away from it. The two children are standing a few paces away, drenched by the rain, watching him. The pole is lying on the ground between them. David stands and looks at them. Liquid splashes onto the woman's bruised and bloody wrists, bound tightly by twists of wire. Looming over her, beer bottle in hand, the huge maintenance man spits a stream of liquid at her bruised face. David closes on him from behind, throws his left arm around the man's neck, and clamps his wrists with his other hand. The man tears at the choking arm, and slams David back into the bedroom wall. David's back leaves a dent in the plaster wall. The man tries to throw him off, but David squeezes his throat relentlessly. The man jabs him viciously in the ribs with his elbow, lifts him again, but can't escape the arm across his throat. He staggers across the room, lifting and twisting David, still trying to throw him off. They reel across the room and he smashes David into the wall again. He thrashes about, pulling desperately at the arm locked around his neck, and makes another backward rush into the wall before falling forward onto his knees. He rises off balance and David drags him back down. He sinks to the floor and David tightens his grip yanking against the man's neck. David throws off the inert form and the maintenance man falls face down, motionless. David crosses to the woman and quickly untwists the wire from her wrists. When they are free, her arms flop down. David steps back and the woman slumps sideways onto the floor, limp and unreacting. He stands over her, still in his cape, gazing down at her. David gently opens a closet door. Audrey's sleeping body in a white night dress is carried from the shadowy light of her room to the foot of the stairs. She opens her eyes in the brighter light of the hall, and lifts her head as David carries her up the staircase. She watches him, smiling very faintly, her long, fair hair falling back from her white forehead, and the light making a silver line of her profile, emphasizing her aquiline features, as she stares steadily up at him. He carries her along the landing and into the bedroom, where he lays her softly on the bed.",
    "758": "David's eyes open. Outside, the greenery is becoming a blur. The train is moving faster, shaking more than it did. He watches through the window. He glances across the aisle. A man reading a book closes it and, like the woman beside him, begins to stare out of the window as the train begins to shake more violently. David looks up ahead. Between the seats, he sees another passenger's hand reaching down to grab hold of an armrest. A car is driving down a quite urban street. In a living room, a boy lies over a sofa, his feet over the back, his head hanging down to the floor, flicking through TV channels with the remote, upside down. David slowly swings his legs over the side of a hospital trolley and sits up. In front of him, a white bandaged figure is lying on another trolley. Dressed only in his shirt and trousers, David looks around uncertainly. A white coated man carrying a clipboard, who has been standing by the other figure, walks towards David and is replaced by other medical staff. He holds up a torch. He examines David's eyes. David stares at the other trolley. They both look at the person on the other trolley, whose chest is heaving unevenly. Still staring at the other figure, David slowly shakes his head. David shakes his head again, watching a crimson stain slowly seeping through the bandages of the other passenger. David nods abstractedly as the crimson stain quickly spreads. The other body heaves as blood forms a pool on top of the bandages. David walks stiffly down a hospital corridor lined with silent people standing, sitting, leaning against walls, many of them watching him and smiling. His son sees him, jumps up from the bench, and runs to him. David hugs his son to his chest, gives him a slight smile, and looks over his head at the slim fair-haired woman who has followed the boy. They stare at each other. She moves forward and puts her head on his shoulder, his cheek against her hair. He puts his arm around her, gazing past her. She steps back, looks at David, then at the boy, her head on one side. The boy's lips move. The three of them stand silently for a moment. Then the boy takes the woman's hand and puts it in his father's before setting off down the corridor. As his parents follow, they let go of each others hands. A gaggle of reporters and photographers, one holding a long boom microphone, are standing inside the big double doors at the end of the corridor. Flashlights go off as David's family steps out in the open air.",

Jackson unbuckles it and they all climb inside. Gordon heaves a lever. The cargo door opens Gordon turns and heads for the steps. The plane thumps against the ground. Reaching the cargo hold, Gordon sprints between the rows of cars towards the open rear door. Jackson inserts a key into the Bentley's dashboard. he turns the key. Jackson puts the car into the gear and accelerates towards the cargo exit.

Sasah crosses himslef. And closes his eyes. It comes to stop as he opnes his eyes. The plane comes perilously close to the drop. Sasha breathes in then grins. The grin is vanishing from his face as the plane starts to go down in a steep incline rapidly gaining speed. It falls into an abyss and explodes Watching from up above, Tamara sobs. Jackson looks skywards when he hears the helicopter. A fleet of helicopters carries wild animals in suspended harnesses. The group on the ground stare. Then Gordon starts to wave.

There are massive structures to the left with work going on the various arks. Yuri is at the R3 Boarding gate Gordon walks with Tamara. They all stop. Lily spots light.

Soldiers crouch behind him. They arrive at a busy research facility. Jackson smooths back his black hair. In an office with Professor West, Adrienne talks to Satnam via the Internet. He talks a great expression worn by Satnam and West. Mouth agape, Adrienne straightens away from the computer screen. Wide-eyed Adrienne frowns.

Noah zips the door closed on Jackson. Jackson sits back and reads the text. Jackson sits in his limo typing on his laptop. He spots Charlie nearby broadcasting from an RV. Newspaper clippings. Charlie, who has a beard darker than his long, straggly hair, looks around furtively then leans in close. Jackson frowns dubiously then nods calmly. Gordon hugs Kate in a supermarket. She smirks. A crack appears in the car park outside. It rumbles beneath a car. The crack opens approaching another car. In the supermarket. He finds it nearby and hands it to her.

Massive hit on Sultan and he runs to the canvas. Jackson drives the kids in the limo. The kids fell asleep in the back seat.",

Jackson changes into a chauffeur's uniform. Tamara looks fondly at her little Pekingese dog, Caesar. Jackson pulls up on the driveway outside Yuri's palatial mansion in Bel Air.

The house collapses and they board the limo as the trees fall off ahead of them. Jackson reverses the limo and the back door is knocked off. He bumps on a Porsche and it falls into an earthquake. Gordon is slightly pissed. Jackson sets off on high speed as the street falls to pieces. The creeks off the road rears up savagely behind them. Kate in the back seat holding Lilly. The collapsing road rushes out to them. Two old ladies driving steadily ahead of them. Jackson powers through gardens. The old lady powers into a rising section of the road.

Kearney with others watches TV with others in the galley. Harry enters the galley. Tony dazed, gets to his feet and wanders aimlessly towards him. The trolley with the television on it starts to roll, as do other filled trolleys around. The ship vibrates. Harry moves towards a door and hangs onto a handle. Tony clings to a table. As the ship starts listing, the table is torn and personnel sliding down the slope. Tony loses his grasp on the table and slithers along the floor away from Harry still clinging to the hammock. Harry pulls himself out on to the deck as the ship lists behind him until he faces the black night sky. The ship keels over to the starboard side then completes a hundred and eight degree turn. The waves wash off. In Washington a white sheet flutters in the breeze and a wheel turns. There is not much movement elsewhere. President Wilson looks up as he hears the noise of water. The water up the tarmac swelled by the onrush from Chesapeake Bay thunders towards the city. A wave brings a large aircraft carrier and it buries the whitehouse. On the Antinov, Jackson fiddles with a radio on one of the cars in the loading bay. Kate, in a parka, wanders over to him. She opens the passenger door and settles down beside him. He glances at her. He turns to look at the radio again. She gazes out of the windscreen. Kate watches him then turns her head away. She takes her hand up to her cheek. He blinks, inclines his head and stares at the radio. On Air Force One. Anheuser walks over to the screen. They turn to Professor West. The Antinov cockpit. Jackson and Yuri climb down the steps, leaving Gordon in the cockpit with Sasha. In the cargo hold, Jackson hands Yuri life jackets. Jackson leans on the steps and looks across at his sleeping family. Still standing by the steps, Jackson wearily removes a life jacket from its container. As he does so, his son Noah wakes and looks over at him. Jackson, taken by surprise, stares at Noah. Jackson lowers his gaze and nods. Father and son both nod. They hug. Kate wakes. The Karpovs put on the life jackets. The plane descends rapidly. Both the Curtis children have their life jackets on.",

Kevin, eyes closed, hopes he hasn't gone too far. He talks into a dictaphone. His jaw drops in astonishment. He's spotted the closet full of dresses. She rushes after him, barging him out of the way to close the closet doors. She strides off to put on the shiny dark green dress. He shakes his head in disbelief and takes a photo of the closet. Jane rolls her eyes self-consciously. She pulls out a yellow dress with pleats and orange flowers. One bridesmaid falls over. Next, a twirly orange number. It's a Japanese style kimono. They bow to each other and Kevin takes a photo. At the wedding, Jane crouches down to be the same height as the Japanese bridesmaids. There's one with long black gloves and even a man's evening suit. Jane does a high-stepping routine with a top hat and sashays in pink floral print. There's a bright one like yellow and pink candy floss, and Kevin gets caught up in a white skirt like a giant snowflake, with dazzling yellow. The wedding is on a lawn overlooking the ocean. The bridesmaids wear tiny pink strapless mini-dresses. Jane poses with the heavily made up bride and a much older, open-shirted groom. She poses in gauzy red, shiny candy pink and flowery baby blue as Kevin lounges on the couch taking pictures. He finds a cowboy hat with a red flower on the brim. At that wedding, Jane is on a horse that ends up facing the wrong way for the photo. He finds a pair of flippers. At the underwater wedding, Jane smiles in floral bathing cap as the bride and groom share a watery kiss. He reaches for the dictaphone. He looks awkward at catching her off guard, looking sad and vulnerable. They sit opposite one another, squirming in uncomfortable silence. Later, Jane, still looking unhappy, hangs the dresses back in the closet. On a sunny day, Jane arrives at Tess' apartment. Jane becomes suspicious as Tess stands blocking the doorway. Pedro is vacuuming and dancing. Jane looks appalled. Kevin is at work. Kevin watches Maureen walk off, shaking his head. Later, he and Jane are scanning the bar codes on items for the wedding list. He scans some china penguins. She looks mortified. He grins and brandishes the scanner. High above the busy streets at the New York Journal, Kevin approaches Maureen's office. He looks horrified. Jane hurries to meet George on the terrace of the boat house. Back at the paper, Kevin picks up the phone.",
    "787": "Marcus looks incredulously at Willie who drags on a cigarette. In a boxing ring, he's talking to the kid. Marcus is his opponent. Marcus looks him over. The kid steps forward and kicks Marcus in the crotch, doubling him up. He punches the kid low. He whacks Willie in the balls too. He hits Marcus in the nuts and all three combatants lie, writhing in agony, on the canvas. Willie turns to the kid. They kick at each other. That night, Grandma has collapsed in front of the TV in the lounge when Willie and Sue come in, they see her. Granny lies back on the sofa, deathly still, with her mouth agape. They walk a little closer. Willie goes over to her. Sue looks on anxiously as Willie bends over Granny. Willie looks round at Sue. He holds his hand in front of her mouth then puts his head to her chest to listen for a heartbeat. Granny suddenly comes to. Later on, in a bedroom, a black rug is spread out on the floor. On it lies odd discarded clothes. Nearby, Sue lies on her back in her bra and jeans. A bare-chested Willie sits astride her, wearing his jeans and a Santa hat. He leans down and seductively licks from her navel up to her bra. He then leans forward and kisses her. He kisses his way back down her body and grips her pants between his teeth and pulls on them. As he does so, the kid comes in through the door. He hands Willie a roughly carved bit of wood with a ribbon round it. Mystified, Willie looks at it. He holds up his injured hand. Willie looks moved. She props herself up on her elbows. Willie stares at the pickle. Sue smiles. He stares at her. He looks at her and nods to himself. He smiles and shrugs. The next morning, Willie is back in his Santa gear and rooting around in the fridge in the kitchen when the kid runs in. Willie takes the report card. Willie puts the report card down. Willie stops buttering toast. Thurman looks down sadly. Willie angrily throws down his knife. Willie is struck dumb. Thurman picks up his report card and heads out of the kitchen. Willie watches him go, a thoughtful expression crossing his face. At night Marcus and Lois sit in the van in the deserted mall car park watching the staff entrance. They see Gin come out. Marcus and Lois watch as Gin gets in his big Chevrolet car and drives off. Gin drives down a deserted unlit road. Up ahead he sees a light swinging from side to side. The van's up the road side.",
    "793": "He then lobs the bottle over his shoulder and it smashes on a Mercedes windscreen. Unconcerned, Willie ambles after Marcus towards a mall inside a Manager deals with an irritate Santa. Harrison sees Willie and Marcus. He gazes lustly after her through his cigarette smoke. Marcus winces. Marcus shoves Willie. In an office, Bob sits with a black guy who takes a gargantuan drag on a cigarette. The security chief eyes Bob. The chief peels an orange. Down in front of the grotto, Marcus works a crowd of kids. Santa's chair is conspicuously empty. Marcus turns to a gum-chewing female helper. Marcus rolls his eyes, shakes his head, then turns to the kids. Marcus goes backstage and finds Santa comatose. He wakes him roughly. Santa swigs his grog as Marcus goes out front where kids are lined up. Inside the grotto. A fat kid with an ice cream. The fat kid takes a deep breath and sneezes over Santa. A small girl sits on snotty Santa's knee. A boy with long hair sits on his knee. He shoos the boy away and looks over at Marcus. A bus pulls up at a bus stop near some cool skaterat kids. The bus door open and a fat boy with curly blonde hair steps off. The skaterats clock him. Fat Ass tries to look dignified. He walks on. The skaterat throws a tin which bounces off Fat Ass's hand. Eyes front, Fat Ass waddles on towards the mall. Inside, he's in the grotto. Santa impatiently munches nuts. Marcus leads Fat Ass over to surly Santa and he sits on his knee. Fat Ass stares at him. He's got boogies dangling from his paunchy nose. He pulls his beard. At the end of the day, Fat Ass is sitting in the car park outside the mall as Willie and Marcus come out. Willie gives Marcus the finger as he walks away across the car park. Fat Ass watches him go. Still in his Santa suit, Willie sits alone at the counter in a bar and lights a cigarette. He chews some gum and looks resentfully around the bar. He takes in the usual collection of festive social drinkers out enjoying a Christmas drink. He drags on his cigarette and his gaze falls on a bald, goatee-bearded Indian guy giving him the evil eye across the bar. Willie stares back at him. The Indian guy keeps his malevolent gaze on Willie and looks away. The barmaid comes over to join them and sniffs his empty glass. The barmaid refills his glass and gives him a sunny smile. He knocks back his drink. She frowns, then smiles. The barmaid grins and laughs. She pours out a shot for herself as well as Willie's.",
    "795": "Gin munches on his orange and regards bespectacled Bob, who looks away thoughtfully. That night, Willie drives a seven series BMW in through the gates of the motel. He sees someone with a torch is in his room. He kills the lights of the car. She takes the strawberry blonde wig off and comes over. On the phone. Willie puts his stuff down on a bed and begins taking off his fake snow-covered boots. He gets off the bed and goes over to a wardrobe. The kid watches Willie in the bath. The kid blinks a couple of times. Willie lies in bed, the kid hovering at the bedside. The next morning, Willie is still asleep in bed. The kid comes in, clutching a glass of orange juice and an advent calendar. Gradually, Willie surfaces from his slumber. He sits up and takes the glass. He gives the kid a look and puts the glass down. The kid climbs on to the bed. He settles beside Willie and opens the relevant door on the calendar, then reads what's written on the back of the door. The kid gives a doubtful looking Willie the door. He knocks the chocolate out of the calendar. He does and turns to Willie. The kid gets off the bed. Willie looks dubiously at the door off the calendar. At lunchtime, he is eating with Marcus and his oriental girlfriend, Lois, at a restaurant in the mall. Marcus regards him with thinly-veiled contempt. Willie masticates a massive mouthful of salad and glares vainfully at Marcus. Lois and Marcus head off. A mom and her young son spot Willie in his Santa suit. Jimmy's mother looks at Willie expectantly as she holds the hand of the sulky boy by her side. Jimmy's mum scoops him up and hurries away, leaving dear old Santa to his salad. Out in the shops, Lois scrutinizes a swatch of fabric and tries on a pair of designer sunglasses. She moves on and looks over a mink stole with a very critical eye. Having decided it's not too bad, she notes it down on her shopping list. Detecting a possible sale, a saleswoman comes over to her. Again, Gin, the security chief, walks up behind a boy pursuing a shelf of video games. Gin turns back to the boy. Back at his new digs, Willie is playing checkers with the kid. The kid moves a piece, keeping his finger on it. Uncertain, he moves it back again. Willie eyes the kid a little impatiently. The kid moves another counter, but still keeps a pudgy finger on it, and looks at Willie, then changes his mind and moves it back. Willie watches as the kid moves a third piece but still keeps his finger on the counter.",
    "796": "The kid removes his finger. Then, before Willie can move, changes his mind and puts the counter back where it was. Willie struggles to contain his irritation. The kid quickly moves one of his pieces, taking three of Willie's, and reaching the far end of the board at the same time. Willie glares and throws the board in the air. The kid stares placidly at him. The kid is unruffled. Willie opens the door to a balding man. He proffers his hand. Willie glances at the kid. He hands Willie some paperwork. As Grandma nods off in front of the TV, Willie is outside entertaining the barmaid in the hot tub. Still wearing his festive red cap, Willie energetically humps Sue, the barmaid up against the side of the hot tub putting in smokes and foam. Afterwards, in the living room, he pours himself a straight vodka and her one with orange. They sit on the sofa together. He hands her her glass, and they each take a swig of their respective drinks. She sits back and smiles. She laughs to herself, and he nods off. She looks a little bit disappointed. Later Wille accompanies her to the front door and sees her out. She gives him a kiss and trips over the front step. She heads off into the night. Willie shuts the front door and, vodka bottle in hand, reaches over to the hall table where the kids advent calendar is lying. He picks up the calendar and puts the bottle down on the table. He then proceeds to tear open the remaining doors on the calendar and scarf the chocolate inside. Calendar ruined, chocolate eaten, he picks up the vodka bottle and lurches towards the lounge. He stops in the doorway and drains the bottle of its remaining contents, which is about a quarter. He belches, falls backwards, and lies unconscious on the hall carpet. The next morning he is roused by a distressed kid and is unfazed as his grandma. The kid's hand is covered in blood. Willie follows him to the kitchen where he puts the hand under the tap. He pours vodka on the cut. Willie turns the tap off, takes a slug of vodka, and walks back into the hall. Willie looks slightly uneasy. Then he spots the tattered remains of the advent calendar lying on the hall table. Later that morning, Willie drives the BMW into the deserted car park. Marcus is standing beside a green van waiting for him. They open the back of the van, and Marcus irritably hands Willie an empty Santa sack. Willie shakes his head. He puts a drill in the gift-wrapped box. The gift-wrapped safe-breaking equipment loaded into the sack, Willie and Marcus head for the mall.",
    "797": "Outside a door, a security guard is on duty. The tall, blonde security guard checks his watch. In the back room Willie puts the sack down, and Marcus points to an air conditioning vent. Marcus takes the cover off the vent and clamors into the duct. Clutching a torch, he crawls along it. A man in an office looks up at the duct as noises emanate from it. Another woman working at her desk looks up, as does a woman at the next desk. The woman turns around, looks at the duct, shrugs, and gets on with her work. Marcus arrives at a vent and looks out into a security office full of monitors. He looks at the equipment and makes some notes on a pad. Gin is having a pedicure. He answers his phone. Roger Merriman, the kid's dad, is in prison. Gin walks into the prison visitors room where balding, bespectacled Roger is sitting. Gin nods his head and gets up. Roger looks confused. Willie cooks for the kid and Grandma. He serves it up. He spoons a dollop onto it. He turns back to the stove and flips the bologna. The kid heads off to get it. Willie serves up a plate of North Pole-style fried bologna for himself and puts it on the breakfast bar. The kid hands it to him. He hands it back to the kid who struggles to open the appropriate door. Rather as if someone might have already opened it and then stuck it back down with a bit too much adhesive. Willie watches out of the corner of his eye as the kid finds a cheap sweet inside. Bob is with Gin, who's mixing himself a dose of Fibracell stool softener. Bob winces. Gin slurps his stool softener and grimaces. The bus pulls up outside the mall and the skaterats see the kid getting off at the stop. The kid sees them and hesitates for a moment. Then, eyes front, keeps walking down the street. The skate rats follow in, close behind him, their interest clearly malicious. They get him and they grot him. The boy wanders off and Santa scratches his own ass. The kid appears, his pants around his armpits. Marcus heads off. Willie looks at the kid. Willie stares incredulously at the kid for a moment then shakes his head. The kid just stares at him. The kid walks away still with his underpants up around his armpits. Willie watches him go with a doleful expression. Willie turns back to Marcus who, for an elf, is staring at him in a very deadpan way. Gin is the next in line. Gin, Willy, and Marcus in a bar. Marcus shifts uneasily.",
    "798": "Marcus leans forward. Marcus glances at Willie and rubs his chin thoughtfully. Gin gets up from the table and goes. Marcus and Willie regard each other. Willie resignedly rests his head on his hand while Marcus slips into a brooding silence. The next day, a very large queue of excited children and their mothers has formed at the western-themed Christmas Corral Grotto. A semi-comatose Santa is on his way as he lies on the escalator clutching a broken bottle. Marcus, back in elf guise, is trying to calm the kids. At the top of the escalator, Santa drunkenly gets to his feet and lurches slowly towards the grotto, broken bottle still in hand. Marcus shakes his head as Santa makes his way into the grotto, bumping into one of the kids as he does so. In his state of extreme over-refreshment, he keels over and collapses on top of a fake cactus and a sack of presents. The kids and moms gasp as Santa rallies and gets on his feet, only to fall over a life-size model donkey. He's falling on his back. He sees a second donkey going over. He scrambles to his feet and slugs the donkey with a big right hook, knocking its head off. He then punches and kicks the donkey's body to bits in a fine display of drunken violence. The moms hurriedly usher their offspring away as Gin strides up. Gin drops Willie. Marcus shoves Gin contemptuously in the leg and marches off and drags Willie away. Later on, Willie is back at the kid's house in the garage. He sits in Roger's BMW with the engine running, having first run a hose from the exhaust pipe into the driver's window in order to commit a seasonal suicide by carbon monoxide poisoning. The kid walks into the garage and sees him. Willie's head lolls to one side as he inhales the noxious fumes. The kid walks over to the car and looks in through the driver's window. Willie moves slightly. Willie raises his head a little and looks at the kid. The kid turns and makes to go out of the garage. Willie winds the driver's window down and hands the kid a letter. He sees the kid has got a black eye. Later, Willie is smashing into the chief skaterat's face. He turns to the rest of the gang. Two other kids, on bikes, watch astounded as Santa administers the festive beating. Back at the mall, Marcus and Willie are in the locker rooms after a hard day dishing out presents. Marcus gets changed out of his elf gear while Willie, in contemplative mood, sits on a bench and sucks on a bottle of gut rot.",

She has a rich body. PEARL comes to her and she picks up PEARL and the doll; JOHN, laden with his oath, walks quickly into the house. WILLA does a bewildered take, then looks again towards the cars o.s. He lies on his back, chuckling and murmuring indistinctly in his sleep. BEN lies in profile. From the bunk above, the face of PREACHER stretches down into the SHOT, upside down, snake-like. BEN wakes, sees PREACHER, and hits him so hard in the face that he falls from bunk to floor. PREACHER collects himself into a squat, nursing his face. BEN sits up in bed. He picks up and wads a sock. PREACHER gets and pockets the knife. They rest on sill of cell window, the lettered fingers legible. The right hand is lettered L-O-V-E. The hands open, disclosing his open knife. They close over it. His eyes lift from his hands, heavenward. Moonlight on his face. He prays, quietly. Same SHOT as before, but now, prison lights are on; and a man, a prison GUARD, waits close inside door. BART the HANGMAN joins him with a silent salute. BART wears a hard derby. They walk in silence into MEDIUM, MOVING SHOT, the GUARD talkative, BART reluctant to talk. The Penitentiary recedes in b.g. On porch, by door, is a doll's perambulator. BART and GUARD walk into the SHOT. GUARD stops, BART starts up his front steps. The GUARD leaves the SHOT; BART goes in. He hangs up his coat and hat. Across this his wife speaks o.s.; a lighted door is ajar at rear of hall. He looks past her, and we see two small CHILDREN asleep in a big brass bed. BART registers, turns again to the basin, and we PAN them back into the original TWO-SHOT. His WIFE'S eyes go sharp and quiet. BART rinses his hands. A sigh; he takes up the towel. He looks at her a moment. towards his CHILDREN. He goes into their room on tiptoe. He approaches his children, across whose bed WE SHOOT without yet seeing them. He comes into MEDIUM CLOSE-UP. As he leans and we TILT DOWN, he extends his large hands.

He dials a number on the phone. He has another drag on the cigarette. He slowly raises the phone to his ear. A surveillance view of the city. In a park, Hoffman calls Ferris, who's walking through an airport terminal. On a residential street, Ferris and Skip get out of an SUV. They communicate through earpieces. Sadiki emerges from an apartment building. Ferris walks up and follows him to his car. They are watched by men in a white four-by-four. The four-by-four drives at them. Sadiki gets in his car. Ferris smashes a window. Sadiki drives away. Ferris and the attackers exchange fire. An agent drives the SUV after the four-by-four but crashes. Skip is thrown through the windscreen. Ferris keeps shooting. The attackers drive off after Sadiki. Skip lies on the ground covered in blood. Ferris feels for a pulse in his neck. He makes a call on his mobile. Sadiki sits on a chair in a shabby room. A man sits filming him. Al-Saleem's lieutenant pours a drink. He hands the drink to Sadiki. The lieutenant looks at Sadiki curiously. In another room, Al-Saleem watches the video footage of Sadiki on a small screen. Outside the city, a group of boys stand on a hillside. Further down the hill, some dogs mooch about. Sadiki lies dead amongst piles of rubbish. Skip lies unconscious in a hospital bed with a breathing tube in his throat. Ferris stands by the bed, staring at Skip. Ferris swigs from a bottle of soda. Ferris picks up a phone and sits by a window. Sitting on a terrace by a lake, Hoffman pulls out his earpiece and sighs. Ferris walks into his apartment and steps on an envelope. He picks it up and shuts the door. He walks into the living room. He puts his keys on the table and opens the envelope. He takes out a photograph of him and Aisha walking down a street. He stares at the photo. He looks around anxiously. Then, he picks up a bowl and hurls it at the wall. He storms out of the apartment. Aggressively driving through town, he calls Aisha on his mobile. A mobile on a table in Aisha's apartment rings. Ferris speeds along a street and stops. Ferris gets out and runs across the street. He holds out his hand and the car stops. Ferris slaps the bonnet and runs to Aisha's apartment building. He heads up the stairs with his phone pressed to his ear. Ferris slows up as he approaches a gate.",

Cala looks at the boys and points. Aisha looks at Cala, worried. She waves a white napkin. He smiles and raises his eyebrows at Aisha. They walk out to the street. He holds out his hand. Aisha smiles and looks up to a window. Cala is looking down at them. Ferris waves to her. Without shaking hands, Ferris goes. Aisha wrings her hands as she looks up at people leaning out of windows, watching her. Hani gives Ferris photographs of Al-Masri and Sadiki with young women in a club. Hani lights a cigar. Ferris frowns earnestly. Hani looks at a grandfather clock. Ferris's eyes dart. He smiles and holds up the file of photographs. Garland works on a computer. Garland stretches his arms above his head.

A soldier detonates a bomb. Al-Saleem watches a news report with one of his men. Ferris, Hani and Garland are also watching. Garland sends the message in Arabic. Ferris pulls out his earpiece. Al-Saleem sits on a balcony. His lieutenant walks over with a laptop. He sits and opens the laptop, which displays a picture of Sadiki. Al-Saleem looks at the picture. Al-Saleem studies the photo and narrows his eyes. In his office, Sadiki shows a model to three men. A colleague calls over. Sadiki goes to a computer and opens his mail. Emails flood across the screen. He frowns as he starts to read the messages. Below the message is a photograph of someone wearing a balaclava. The next has a picture of someone holding up the Koran. Sadiki looks at a TV which plays news footage of the bombing. Increasingly alarmed, he takes off his glasses. Carrying a case and laptop, Sadiki rushes out of the building. He walks out onto the street. He stops and looks round anxiously. Then he walks over to his Mercedes, deactivating the alarm as he goes. He walks round to the driver's door. He unlocks it. He opens it and gets in. He frantically turns the key in the ignition. He switches on the headlights. A group of men wander past, watching. He drives away in his cream Mercedes.",

Her black hair pinned up in an elegant bun, Suze composes herself and looks towards the altar, at Tarquin's smiling face. After the wedding, Rebecca and the rest of the guests wave as the newlyweds are driven off in a white Rolls Royce. Rebecca, standing among the well-dressed crowd in her spotted shrug, smiles fondly. As the people begin to disperse, her face starts to cloud over, as if suddenly thinking of something sad and serious along with the good things. She turns away from the church and starts walking across a city street in her pink bridesmaid dress, with a heavy tulle petticoat and long, white gloves. She walks past the window of Yves St. Laurent. A black China mannequin knocks on the window. Rebecca lifts the hem of her pink dress and considers. A second mannequin knocks on the glass and shows her the orange bag she's carrying. Rebecca compares it to her pink one. The mannequin jiggles the bag seductively. Rebecca's eyes fill with wonder. She smiles eagerly. But then, with a little shake of the head, she walks on. The two doll-like mannequins look at each other. The seated one with the bag stands up. Both clap their hands. The mannequins in all the fashion windows she passes applaud her. Rebecca starts to laugh, swinging her skirt joyfully, then stops in her tracks. Luke is standing in front of her in the middle of the pavement. She looks at him like a kid who's been caught stealing sweets. She shrugs inanely. She steps towards him. He steps towards her. They're in front of Asprey's. She shakes her head hopelessly as he looks intently into her face. A faint smile flickers across his lips. Reaching into his coat pocket, he brings out the green scarf. He wraps the scarf around her neck. Rebecca beams at him. He kisses her on the lips. As they kiss, a pair of ankle boots is placed in a window display. Rebecca spots them in the corner of her eye. A tall, white-faced mannequin tilts her head and winks at her. Rebecca grins and goes back to giving Luke's kiss her full attention. The screen fades to black, leaving just the green scarf. She introduces Alicia to Janne. Janne kisses Alicia's hand. She dances with Luke. Luke spots Graham throwing himself about to the music. Graham lies on his back. Jane turns his legs like a wheel.",

He sits at his computer and logs into company records. Diana enters Cornish's information into a card burner and inserts a blank card. On Ken's computer, he sees Cornish's actual photo. Ken quickly stands. The burner finishes processing and prints out the card. Smiling, Diana hands it to Sandy. He eyes the card. Ken swiftly moves through the offices and approaches the records room doors. He inputs the code and they slide open. As he quickly enters, Ken finds the room vacant. He steps toward the computer with wide eyes. Now, Sandy and Diana exit the building through an unmarked alley door. She grabs the card. Now, Sandy and Diana enter an upscale hotel lobby. They approach reception. In their silver sedan, Julian and Marisol speed across a bridge into St. Louis. As she follows Sandy into the luxury suite, Diana mouth falls open. She grabs a grape from a fruit platter. Loosening his tie, Sandy enters a room and removes his suit coat. He tosses it onto a chair and flops back on the bed. Now, in a frothy bubble bath, Diana blows a handful of suds. Diana finishes off a large bottle of champagne. As Sandy sleeps in the same outstretched position.

Diana shakes the can and sniffs it. Then, sprays her hair. Leaning back and forth, Diana douses her entire mop of hair. She shakes her messy hair around, then faces the mirror. Diana surrounds her head in a cloud of hairspray. Looking up, she spots the giggling stylists, who abruptly stop and look away. Diana blinks rapidly and shifts in place, then turns toward the checkout counter with an armful of products. Striding forward, she stops and lowers her gaze. Diana slowly turns around and approaches the stylists with her lips pressed together. The male stylist steps forward. Diana sits down and he spins her toward the mirror. Now, in the swanky hotel restaurant, Sandy slouches alone at the bar with a glass of water. Sitting up, he glances around the room, then takes a sip.

A bar of light from door falls across PREACHER'S face. From JOHN, just a questioning helpless reaction. JOHN is still. He gawks at his own folly, covers his mouth with his hand and looks up at PREACHER, stiffens, relaxes, and chuckles softly. JOHN starts for the stairs. It stands vibrating, then moves out of shot with receding engine sound o.s., disclosing: ICEY'S skirts in BACKGROUND. They are awfully spic-and-span; they even wear shoes. They wave after the car, bewilderedly. She hustles out of shot. His hand clamps over her mouth. She struggles and whimpers. His hand comes up; she puts out her own, expecting a loving hand-clasp; but PREACHER points to the window. Startled, then again tender, she moves to: She adjusts the shade, looking always towards the bed. She smiles maternally. As we PULL BACK and PAN into FULL SHOT OF BED she comes to the bed and sits on the edge and slips off her mules. PREACHER'S back is to her. With a sounding of bedsprings PREACHER turns. His voice is quiet and cold. WILLA puts her face down to the pillow and moans. PREACHER snaps on a harsh bare bulb at center of room. She obeys. WILLA hesitates. WILLA walks to meet her image in the mirror; her eyes on. Her head drops, facing the mirror. WILLA is in HEAD CLOSE-UP; bulb hangs at center; PREACHER, in his nightshirt, is beyond it. Her mouth trembles; she can't talk. WILLA just opens her mouth. He stands watching her for a moment; then he snaps off the light and gets into bed. WILLA, in the darkness, does not move. She folds her hands in prayer and lifts her eyes. It lies face down on arbor bricks, its back wide open; money spilling out. A little breeze toys with the money. Then we hear a snipping sound o.s. TILT UPWARD into. She sits at the end of the grape-arbor. She finishes cutting a skirted paperdoll out of a hundred dollar bill and lays it down beside a male hundred-dollar paper-doll. She pats the dolls. PEARL starts guiltily and looks towards him, scrambling money together. JOHN'S footsteps o.s. As he stoops toward her, dumb with horror. She continues to gather the money together. He stands at far end of arbor. PREACHER'S watch-chain gleams. The shot SLOWLY CLOSES DOWN on it and becomes still. We see the paper-dolls blow past him. JOHN starts to laugh uncontrollably. His helpless reaction. He holds out his hands to her; she comes to his lap, dropping her doll at his feet.",
    "841": "The detective leaves, while the boss lingers with his arms folded. Sandy gazes at the floor, then rises and watches the men leave. Holding his cell phone, he looks at the salon number displayed in red. He glances up, then down to the number's origin. The detective glances at Daniel, who rubs his face with one hand. Sandy runs off. Sandy's wife helps him pack. Sandy shrugs at his wife. He sets her on the bed. He takes the folded mug shot from his back pocket. She gives him a little nudge. Sandy heads out. He kisses Trish. She hands him his suitcase. Now, a plane sails across the sky. Our view moves over a sunny beach toward a city skyline. Outside Ladies Choice salon. Sandy rolls up his window in a gold Sedan. The plump thief strolls into view in a loud pink print shirt and poofy hair. She walks in slow motion. Sandy observes her go to a tiny blue Fiat with a red stripe on its side. She bounces to the driver's door and gets in. The garishly made-up woman takes a handicapped parking tag off the rear view mirror and tosses it back. Sandy puts his seat belt on as the woman zips out of her parking space. Now, on a freeway, Sandy tails the thief while she plays with her smartphone. She looks in her rear view and catches sight of him. Setting her phone down, the redhead takes her sunglasses off, looks into the driver's side mirror, and gives her car some gas. Odometer needle rises. Sandy presses his accelerator. The speedometer ticks up to 50. The woman tightens her mouth and slams on the brakes with both feet. The sedan bangs the Fiat's rear bumper. In her rear view, she sees Sandy white-knuckling his wheel. She puts her sunglasses on and primps her hair, then gets out. The short woman looks up at Sandy, then punches his throat. She pushes him and goes for her car. He pulls her hair. She delivers a swift kick to his crotch. Sandy sags as she runs to his car. She gets into his sedan. Sandy limps toward her. She reverses while flipping him off. He shambles back to her Fiat and gets in. He discovers the key missing. In the rear view, he sees an empty road. She comes it through from the sides. The sedan T-bones the compact. She pins it to the guardrail. Sandy tries in vain to open the crushed door as she speeds down the highway. He reaches through the sunroof. He finds a pink registration form in the glove box. He takes it out. He reads the address. Now, in a tiny pink house with a jet ski on the lawn, a variety of small expensive products in sets of three or more clutters the kitchen.",
    "862": "He drops a tray. He picks it up as he runs from the church. Valjean is brought back to the church. The bishop looks up. He brings over two candlesticks and hands them to Valjean. The bishop places his hand on Valjean's head. A tomb with carvings of two Christified figures. Beside it, Valjean kneels at the altar. His papers in his hand. Blood stains his temple where he was hit. Having walked away from the altar, he returns and sinks to his knees. Valjean strides out of the church ripping his papers to shreds as he goes to the far corner of the church yard. He throws the pieces into the air. The church in the walled village sits on the top of a hill. One piece of paper flies high in the air towards the sun. Javert in uniform rides in the rain ahead of four other uniformed horsemen. They enter the city. In a dark cobbled slum, a woman takes a wrapped body of a child from a weeping mother. In a factory. A worker snatches a note. Fantine tries to retrieve the note. Valjean is clean-shaven. His hair is dark and neatly trimmed. Smartly dressed, he looks every inch a gentleman. He glances up to an office and sees Javert gazing down at the factory floor. Unnerved, Valjean walks away from the women. The foreman throws Fantine out onto the street. Foreman flings coins at her. Valjean in a courtyard sees the other uniformed horseman who accompanies Javert. Inside, Javert paces in the office. Valjean slowly makes his way up the stairs. The two men bow. Javert removes his hat and hands a paper to Valjean. He hands Javert a rosary. Javert lowers his gaze. They rush out onto the coupled street. A man is trapped under a cart. Valjean is crouched down beside him. Javert watches as Valjean places his shoulder under the shaft. As he did with the flagpole, Valjean grimaces as he gets to his feet. He lifts the cart off the trapped man. Javert's eyes narrow. Val drops the shaft. Javert hesitates then bows his head. Javert turns away. Fantine walks quickly along the streets. She passes people standing in the darkness. She has a shawl wrapped tightly around her. She stops and stares forlornly. She passes a man smoking a long pipe and women seated. She approaches a scruffy man. Fantine's sleek, long dark hair is cut. Fantine is held down as a tooth extractor is pushed into her mouth. A silver-haired man. Fantine glugs from a small bottle. Her hand is placed in a man's. He's wearing a captain's hat. The captain pushes her down and turns her over. He slowly raises the hem of her dress.",
    "868": "Valjean calls to Marius. Cannons are fired splintering the barricade and throwing up clouds of smoke. The students keep shooting at the soldiers. Wood splinters and flies through the air as more cannon balls hit the barricade. Some of the students are injured. Soldiers advance on the barricade and start to climb up it. The students keep shooting. A soldier is slashed with a sword. A student is bayoneted in the back. Students hammer on the door of a house but it's locked. A shutter is pulled closed. They manage to get into a building. Marius is shot. He falls to the ground, his head and arm bleeding. Valjean goes to him and drags him into the building. Enjolras hacks the wooden stars away so the soldiers can't follow. The students climb up to the first floor of the building. Soldiers burst into the building with guns blazing. Marius over his shoulder. Valjean hides behind a door. Soldiers aim their muskets up at the ceiling. Enjolras and the students are huddled in the room above. The shots go up through the floor hitting most of the students. They fall. Valjean sees a low door and yanks it open. He climbs down into a sewer and drags Marius in with him. The soldiers are now upstairs. They aim their weapons at Enjolras and a fellow student, the only ones left standing. Enjolras raises the red flag and soldiers open fire. Enjolras falls back through a window. He hangs upside down from the ledge still clutching the red flag. Later on the cobble street below, Javert, now in uniform, walks through a puddle of blood. The cobbles are strewn with the corpses of soldiers. Javert walks into the building where the protesters took refuge. The dead students are laid neatly side by side on all the floor. His eyes stare out lifelessly from his young, pale face. Javert squats down at the end of the line beside the corpse of Gavroche. Javert looks around, moved by the scene. He removes from his jacket the star shaped Legion of Honor medal with its red ribbon and pins it to Gavroche's coat. Javert frowns and his eyes dart about wildly. He gets up and looks around. He goes to a door, turns the handle, and pushes it open. In the sewer, Valjean is heaving the unconscious Marius along. On ground level, Javert hears Valjean straining. He tries to find the source of the noise. He goes to another door. Javert listens and peers down at a round entrance to the sewers. Valjean slips down a duct tunnel. He and Marius plummet into the cavernous sewers landing unconscious in dark sludge. On ground level, Javert frowns.",
    "87": "The preacher's eyes crinkle and he turns to Pearl, smiling brightly. His eyes snap back to John and his voice is like a whip. His eyes never leave John's. Pearl gapes up at John as he speaks. As he gets up, the cellar door is in the background. They cross him, towards the door. The children precede the preacher, who carries a candle in a holder. Pearl is gaping at John's lie. John is looking left and right, casing the joint. Now they are at the bottom of the stairs. John sees Pearl's expression and takes her hand. He squeezes Pearl's hand harder, and points. John points out a place beneath a shelf laden with Mason jars; it is at the most distant part of the cellar from the stairs. The preacher starts toward it, leaving them at the foot of the stairs, then turns, catching John's ruse. He shepherds them ahead of him. They arrive beneath the shelf. The preacher sets the candle on a barrel near the shelf-prop and sinks to his knees below shot as Pearl gapes at John and John looks stony. She seems about to speak. His hands sweep dust and expose concrete. He straightens on his knees and turns to the children in close background. His sincerity is beyond doubt. He takes his knife out, and springs it open. She starts to sob. The preacher is astounded. His hands fall away from John. He leans back against the wall and talks through laughter. His eyes are all over the place. The preacher makes a lunge across John for the doll; John ducking under his arm, pulls Pearl forward with his left hand; he turns backwards and with his free hand, in one movement, knocks over the candle and pulls out the support on the shelf. Jars shower over him; one crowns him and breaks, shedding guck, which he wipes from his eyes. They start up the stairs. He makes one step forward, steps on a rolling jar, and falls. They are near the top of the stairs. John slips and they nearly fall backward. As John recovers, the preacher enters the shot, his back to us. The children get through the open door as the preacher reaches the top. John slams the door, catching the preacher's hand. The preacher screams. John's astonished eyes peer through the crack in the door; the door loosens; the preacher yanks his hand loose and sucks it, groaning; the door slams to; the bolt is shot home. He snarls like the Big Bad Wolf. Pearl, dangling her doll, cries. John panting, leans against the wall by the door. John is wondering what to do now. A pretty, pastoral shot of the house in light mist, as they run across and leave the shot. Before they disappear, we hear the preacher's fists hammering against the door.",
    "871": "She puts up an umbrella as he helps her out. They climb the spiral staircase inside the building. Nick leans in and kisses Kate full on the lips. Nick looks back briefly as he descends the stairs. Kate grins to herself. In the amber half-light of a darkened room, Kate is fast asleep in bed. The door is ajar. The hallway light comes on, and Zoe slips past the open door clutching a video. Kate stares as she sees Zoe. Wearing pajamas, Kate wanders down the hallway towards a dull, flickering light emanating from the lounge. She pauses outside the open lounge door. Zoe sits on the floor. Zoe watches a home movie of Christine frolicking on a dull, wind-swept beach. She flaps her arms as if pretending to fly as she runs down to the edge of a grey sea. Kate enters the lounge, and joins Zoe on the floor. Now, the TV screen fills with Christine and Zoe's ecstatically happy faces. Christine kisses her smiling daughter on the cheek and beams back at the camera. Attractive, long blonde haired Christine throws back her hair and laughs joyously. Tears well in Zoe's doleful eyes. Kate looks away from the TV and down at Zoe. She puts an arm around her niece. Zoe leans into Kate as the video plays. Christine is running along the beach, waving back at the camera, her jacket and scarf flapping behind her. The grainy video comes to an end. Morning, Kate and Zoe are in Zoe's bed. They lie facing each other, Zoe with her arm on Kate's shoulder. Daylight fills the room. Kate watches a sleeping Zoe. Zoe stares. A smile flickers across Zoe's lips. Then, she closes her eyes again. Kate places an arm around Zoe, and she too closes her eyes. At the restaurant. Bernadette reads a letter. Now, Zoe runs out of her bedroom and down the corridor chased by Kate, who ambushes her coming out of the lounge. Feathers fly as Kate and Zoe gleefully batter each other with their pillows. Kate pushes Zoe backwards onto the sofa. Exhausted, the pair collapse onto the hall floor. Feathers drift down around them. At the restaurant, Nick commands a hectic kitchen. The dining room is packed. Paula and her waiting staff move busily around the tables. Later, she and Nick relax with a brandy. Paula eyes Nick with a smile. Kate's fast asleep in bed. Kate flicks on her bedside lamp. She rises and, wearing her dressing gown, answers the intercom. Nick and Kate sit across from each other at a desk in the lamp-lit lounge. He spoon-feeds the blindfolded Kate some sauce from a container between them. In the soft glow of the lamp, Nick observes Kate with a smile.",
    "878": "Kate arrives home. She looks around with a frown and makes her way through to the kitchen. A plate of cigarette ends sits on the table. She picks it up and empties the cigarette butts into the bin. Kate looks at a clock above the stove. She makes her way down the hall to Zoe's bedroom. Zoe's made herself a den under the bed. Kate nods, then peers under the bed. Zoe's got several stuffed toys with her. Zoe gives a brief nod, and looks away from her aunt. Kate's smile fades, and she looks down sadly. Zoe turns back to Kate. Zoe gives a faint smile. Kate kisses her fingers and touches Zoe's forehead. Kate pulls the valance sheet down, hiding Zoe from view. Kate stands up. She walks slowly out of the bedroom and makes to close the door behind her. She has a change of heart and leaves it open. The next day, Kate and Zoe walk down the street towards the restaurant. Paula looks up as they enter the restaurant. Kate leads Zoe towards the kitchen. In the kitchen, a bored Zoe sits on a worktop, swinging her legs. Kate chats to Leah. Nick has overheard. Nick searches around on a shelf behind Zoe and brings out a bowl and bunch of basil. He places the bowl down next to Zoe and sniffs the basil. He begins to pick the leaves, then holds the bunch out to Zoe. Zoe smells it. Kate sees Nick talking to Zoe. She watches as Nick gives a handful of basil to Zoe. The youngster hesitates for a moment, then begins to help him pick the leaves. Paula walks in. Paula goes back into the restaurant. Later, Nick empties a pan of spaghetti and tomato sauce into a large pasta bowl. Nick walks over to where Zoe's sitting. Sits beside her with the spaghetti. Zoe watches him a little shyly, as Nick sprinkles some of the basil leaves over his meal. Nick winds the spaghetti around his fork and begins to eat. Zoe eyes the food hungrily. A waiter addresses the kitchen. Nick hands the bowl of spaghetti to Zoe and goes back to work. He watches her, as she looks down longingly at the pasta. Zoe looks over at Nick, then back down at the spaghetti. She gingerly picks up the fork and takes a mouthful. Nick continues to watch her as he works. Zoe tucks in hungrily to the spaghetti. Zoe grins at him. Walking back into the kitchen, Kate picks up her apron and ties it around her waist. She gapes in surprise as she sees Zoe devouring the bowl of spaghetti.",
    "883": "Mary prepares to play and the men quickly take their places opposite their partners. As the music starts, the ladies curtsy and the men bow. A group of onlookers gather. Mrs. Bennet turns to glare at her husband. The men stand in one line with the ladies opposite them, then briefly touch hands as they move around the other dancers. Mrs. Gardiner crosses the room and sees Charlotte and Jane sitting down. Charlotte's busy chatting with someone, but Jane looks quietly upset. Later, the girl with red hair is standing with Wickham as Charlotte and Lizzie look on. Wickham smiles at Lizzie as he takes the girl's hand and leads her down through the column of dancers. Lizzie smiles back at him, then turns to look at Charlotte, who has a serious expression on her face. Lizzie turns her attention back to the dance floor where the red haired girl is eyeing Wickham coyly. Charlotte grabs Lizzie's arm. Mary King continues to dance with Wickham, smiling contentedly. Winter has arrived and the ground outside Longbourn is crisp with a white layer of frost. Lizzie's reading a letter. Jane walks out, then she's sitting looking out of her window. A carriage pulls up and Caroline gets out. Caroline climbs back into her carriage and it sets off down the street. Jane stares dolefully out of her window. Back at Longbourn, Lizzie lowers her sister's letter with a pained expression. It's a mild, sunny day and Lizzie is taking a walk in a field near Longbourn. She wanders past post and rail fencing surrounding an old oak tree, idly toying with a leafy twig. As she reaches the grounds of Longbourn, she tosses the twig away and wanders up the graveled driveway to the house. She has a pensive, yet carefree air. Her face framed by the straw brim of her gold-colored bonnet. Lydia comes running out to meet her. In the garden. They continue on past the gardener, who's busily pruning a bush. She casually reaches out to a branch above her head, and pulls off a leaf. Indoors, Mr. Bennet is reading. Hearing a noise from the hall, he looks up from his book to see trunks being moved, and Lizzie standing in her coat and bonnet. She comes in to see him. She goes over to him, and he takes a hand and kisses it. He watches her leave with an endearing smile, then goes back to his book. Lizzie is sharing her carriage with Maria and Sir William Lucas. The horse-drawn carriage continues on past the green canopy of trees. Eventually, it pulls through the gates and into the drive of a sizable, ivy-clad house. Mr. Collins and Charlotte hurry out to meet them as Lizzie, Maria, and Sir William emerge from the cab.",
    "891": "Jane and Bingely stand out amongst the dancers. They move with each other easily, sharing smiles. The dancers move in intricate and formal patterns, circling their partners, then crossing to form lines. The women hold out their arms gracefully forming delicate arcs before gliding back into their starting positions. They separate, then come back. Darcy looks at her defiantly. Whilst his back is turned, Lizzie smiles to herself. Lizzie raises her eyebrows. They're interrupted by Sir William. A look of growing concern crosses Darcy's face. Once again, the dance forces them apart. Lizzie's brow furrows into her frown. Now, opposite to each other. Darcy is beginning to look a little agitated as he circles another dancer. Lizzie looks a little pleased with herself as the dance draws to a close. The gentlemen and ladies bow and curtsy to each other. Darcy takes Lizzie's hand and leads her from the floor. He bows curtly and leaves. Lizzie watches after him, frustratedly. Now, the guests are gathered in a different room. Mr. Bennett joins Mrs. Bennett at the dining table, where she's eating with relish. Jane and Lizzie stand with a happy group, including Bingley. Lizzie smiles and leaves them, meeting Miss Bingley. Miss Bingley swans off. Lizzie looks furious. She strides to a punch bowl and serves herself a cup. A concerned Jane follows her. Mary leaps up from her chair and scurries to the piano. Jane and Lizzie look mortified at Mary's clumsy playing. A furious Miss Bingley signals for her sister to follow her. They brush past Lizzie and Jane, and start maliciously whispering to each other. Darcy and Bingley look at Mary. Mr. Bennet looks embarrassed. Only Mrs. Bennet seems to be really enjoying it. Mr. Darcy stands, towering over Mr. Collins. Darcy walks away. He passes Lizzie, and joins the Bingley sisters. Outside, dogs are reacting to marry's singing. Inside, the Bingley sisters look at Mary with barely disguised contempt. Lizzie gives her father a desperate look. He jumps up from his seat, and joins Mary at the piano. Mary peels off her glasses and leaves the piano, head bowed. Louisa Hurst briskly crosses the room and sits at the piano. Mr. Collins stands awkwardly at the piano, silenced by the playing, he tries to cover up by waving his hands to the music. Lydia comes skipping and swirling into the room. Holding an officer's sword above her head, she collapses in a chair. Lizzie looks mortified. Mrs. Hurst smiles smugly. Mrs. Bennet closes the door on them, then leans in to eavesdrop. She scurries away. He holds up a hand to stop her. She takes a seat. He looks shocked. He rises from bended knee. She hurries out.",
    "893": "Words appear. Wearing 50 black and white stripped uniforms, prisoners march in lockstep single file across the dirt. Each man holding the shoulders of the man in front. A prison guard in a dark blue overcoat squints at them as they pass. Nearby, one prisoner lies motionless at another guard's feet. The line of prisoners continues away from a wall 30 feet high. Guards on either side of them. They march toward a stark building, where a smoke stack reaches into the sky. On a dirt road populate by a few rundown establishments, a Nash sedan stops. The driver's door opens and a tall man with bony features steps out wearing a badge. He opens the back door and helps a raven-haired man in handcuffs step out. Both wearing long overcoats, they walk across the street toward the prison. At the middle of a long high wall, a metal entry gates sits under a lookout tower. As they're near the entrance, the office gives the convict a little shove. The metal gate opens. Just inside, an older guard opens a steel door. As the metal gate closes behind them, the two men passed the guard with no more than a nod from the arriving officer. Inside the prison, inmate's central room filled with work benches, each with its own sewing machine. A prisoner with graying temples lifts a box labeled Mayer Thread Company from a stack. As he carries it across the room, he glances at a presiding guard. With the slight length, the inmate brings the box passed another guard to a work bench. Reaching the bench, he joins a sandy-haired prisoner and sets the box down. They tear off the outer tape. Sitting across from them, a younger inmate glances up. The two men dig through large spools of white thread. They each pulled out a gun, and using the spools to conceal them, passed them to the young inmate and a man sitting next to him. They stealthily tucked the weapons in their pants. From the same box, the older inmate and the sandy-haired man retrieved guns of their own. Crossing between two rows of work benches, the sandy-haired man drops a load of shirts concealing his weapon and grabs one of the guards. The younger inmate punches another guard in the face and holds his gun to his throat. A stocky prisoner repeated strikes a guard with a pipe as the older inmate follows closely behind. Each of the escaping prisoners leads their hostage to the door. The rest of the befuddled inmates stand at their benches. The younger inmate jabs his captive in the gut. Now the newly arrived convict stands behind his presiding officer and another guard at a door.",
    "91": "We hold for a long beat on their regular breathing and snoring. The woman stirs. She reaches for the phone. She hangs up. The man stirs and clears his throat with a long deep rumble. The man sits up, gazes stupidly about. He clears his throat with another deep rumble. Leavings of a huge plate of eggs, ham, toast. Wider, we see Marge now wearing a beige police uniform. She wears a heavy belt holding a revolver, walkie-talkie and various other jangling police impedimenta. Norm is in a dressing gown. As she struggles into a parka. Marge is making her way down the icy front stoop to her prowler. Off-screen we hear the front door open. Marge stamps the snow off her shoes. The reverse shows Marge approaching from her own squad car. Two police cars and an ambulance sit idling at the side of the road, a pair of men inside each car. The first car's driver door opens and a figure in a parka emerges, holding two styrofoam cups. He hands her one of the cups of coffee. Marge looks around as they start walking. Marge is peering into the car. Marge looks up from the car. Marge looks around at the road. She gets up, sweeping snow from her knees. Marge's prowler is parked nearby. She calls up to the road. Marge is on her hands and knees by a body down in the ditch, again looking at footprints in the snow. In the foreground is the head of the state trooper, facing us. Peering at it from behind, still on her hands and knees, is Marge. She gets up, clapping the snow off her hands, and climbs out of the ditch. She is looking at the prowler, which still idles on the shoulder. Marge is driving; Lou sits next to her. Lou gazes out the window, thinking. Jerry and Stan stand bundled in their parkas and galoshes near a row of beached vehicles. Wade sits behind the wheel of an idling Lincoln, waiting for Stan. There is a tap at the horn from Wade, and Stan gets into the Lincoln. Jerry stares down at his laptop. It is a lakeside cabin surrounded by white. A brown Ciera with dealer plates is pulling into the drive. Grimsrud climbs out of the passenger seat as Carl climbs out of the driver's. Grimsrud opens the back door and, with an arm on her elbow, helps Jean out. She has her hands tied behind her and a black hood over her head. With a cry, she swings her elbow out of Grimsrud's grasp and lurches away across the front lawn. Grimsrud moves to retrieve her but Carl, grinning, lays a hand on his shoulder.",
    "912": "Gathering himself, he sniffs, flaring his nostrils, and stares forward with a steely gaze. Red peers out the smeared windshield with a solemn expression. Dillinger stands below an overcast sky. Strands of his greasy black hair hang over his forehead. His gaze drifts to a road, which cuts through a desolate field toward the flat horizon. In a farm house, gang members change clothes while eating. A woman wraps food in newspapers and brings it over to their table. Pete buttons up next to another escapee. Red puts out a cigarette. All of the men leave. Outside, Dillinger walks alone. Without his overcoat, he wears a black vest and a leather gun holster. The woman stops him. They hold eye contact and she lets go. As Dillinger turns and walks away from the farm house, the woman continues to gaze after him. A little boy in overalls comes up and takes her hand. Together, they wander a few steps without taking their eyes off of him. In the car, as Red drives, Dillinger looks back at Pete. He faces forward and glances at Red. A man in a blue suit hurries through lush green woods with a Tommy gun. He trips, then climbs to his feet and runs on. A clean-cut man wearing suspenders swiftly moves after him, toting a rifle. A group of armed lawmen follow behind, charging up a hill. The outlaw races downhill into an apple orchard. At the hill's crest, the clean-cut lawman stops and watches the outlaw run between two rows of trees. He aims his rifle. Floyd runs backwards, firing wildly. The lawman's shot misses. Floyd runs on. Calmly taking a knee, the lawman aims again, rubbing his finger on the trigger. Floyd sprints through the trees, almost out of his pursuer's sight. The lawman's finger engages a secondary trigger, then wraps around the main trigger. The shot blasts through Floyd's belly and he flops on the grass. The shooter gazes up from his sights, then stands and approaches the outlaw with the rest of the men following behind. As the men arrive, Floyd takes out a pistol which the lawman kicks out of his hand. He aims his rifle at the wounded outlaw, who lies on his back. Purvis' piercing stare remains fixed on the dying man. Blood gushes from Floyd's belly wound, saturating his white dress shirt. His head falls back on the grass and his convulsing throat muscles come to rest. The lawmen lower their weapons. Purvis studies the dead outlaw then nods at his men. Purvis slings his rifle strap over his shoulder. His eyes and purses his lips. The Nash sedan comes to a stop. In a clean, white kitchen, a woman standing near the sink folds a newspaper.",
    "913": "Two other women sit at a table. One writes, the other looks out the window. A large man in suspenders peers through the blinds. He turns away from the window and hurries out of the room. Outside, Dillinger and his men step out of their car. As they approach the house, a young blonde woman greets them. He grins and gives the blonde a kiss. They head inside. Later, in a garage, Dillinger sits across from a gunsmith as he disassembles a Tommy gun. He removes the trigger handle and pulls out a coil. Outside a window behind the gunsmith, two cars arrive. Red steps out of the safe house. Dillinger glances at the door where the blonde nods to him. He gets up and leaves the garage. As he crosses to the house, Dillinger tosses a set of keys to Pete, who joins Red to see the new cars. Inside, Dillinger enters the kitchen. A man leans against the refrigerator. Dillinger washes his hands. A woman smokes at the table. Dillinger hands him a stuffed envelope. He goes around the table. He kisses her cheek. Dillinger leaves the kitchen. Three men in fedoras and overcoats ascend a wide staircase, separated from each other by two center railings. Reaching the top, Dillinger stops, scanning a huge bank with angular walls lined with pillars. His two cohorts split off. Pete approaches a guard. He bashes his face and knees him in the gut. Tommy gun in hand, Dillinger gracefully hurtles a counter and grabs a middle-aged man. Ripping the back of his collar, Dillinger parades the bank president around the counter and across the floor. They pass a trembling customer. Dillinger pushes the president forward to a metal gate. One of his men collects cash from a teller. The president sorts keys. Dillinger smacks him in the head with his pistol and points it in his face. The president returns to the door. A robber elbows open a teller cage. The teller frantically gathers cash. Pete hops up on the counter, aiming his machine gun. Outside, Homer discreetly holds a rifle at his side. He sees an arriving police car and backs into a recess by a set of double doors. He knocks with the butt of his rifle. Inside the bank, Dillinger waits as the president fills a sack with money from the safe. In a getaway car, Red checks the time on a pocket watch, then drives away. As policemen run across the street toward the bank, Red's car approaches and Homer casually glances over. Inside, Dillinger pushes the president forward. He notices a few dollars in change set out on the counter and faces the customer it belongs to.",
    "914": "Outside, Homer bashes the cop with the butt of his rifle, uses him as a shield and fires. Inside, a young female teller hurries to Dillinger and they head back down the stairs. Outside Homer shoots up the police car another police car arrives down the block. Red waits in his car as the robbers exit with four hostages. Down the road, lawmen aim rifles over the car's hood. Dillinger and his men, using their hostages as shields cross to the getaway car. Dillinger aims at the police over the president's shoulder. An officer fires first. Homer aims his automatic rifle and with Dillinger, they shoot up the other police car, taking out a couple lawmen. Their car speeds off with Dillinger and Homer on the running boards with their hostages. As they drive down the street, the tails of the crook's overcoats flap in the breeze. The car comes to a stop under a bridge. Dillinger faces Homer's hostage. The two hostages run off. Dillinger notices his young hostage shivering. He wraps his overcoat around her and guides her into the backseat. Red drives off. In the car, Dillinger hands the teller his hat. The car heads down a dirt road leading toward a forest of leafless trees. Homer sits next to the young teller. Pete cracks up. Now in the woods, they tie the president and the young teller to a tree. The bank robbers leave their hostages and stride out of the trees. Reaching their car, they get in and drive away. Now, in a marble hearing room, a square jawed man faces a committee. He tilts his ear toward the chairman. The mustached senator looks Director Hoover in the eye. Hoover whispers to a bespectacled man. Hoover marches out with the bespectacled Suydam and a slender young man. As they walk down a hall, Suydam takes notes. Hoover looks to his young associate. Now a fedora sits on a burgundy leather couch by Purvis, who gazes off thoughtfully. As Hoover exits a nearby office, Purvis stands. They cross an FBI bullpen. The men step onto a sunny veranda, where reporters gather. Hoover faces a microphone. Hoover motions for Purvis to take his place at the mic. Purvis squints decisively at the reporters. Now at his supper club, Dillinger grins as he dines with his friends. He checks his watch and looks toward the door. Rubbing the tip of his nose, he shifts his gaze to the dance floor where a brunette in a red dress dances with a man. Dillinger keeps his eyes fixed on her. His attention shifts as a scrawny guy with glasses approaches. Dillinger stands and shakes his hand. The scrawny Alvin takes a seat beside Dillinger and leans close.",
    "92": "She slides the paper sack toward him. He looks inside. The bottom of the sack is full of fat, crawling earthworms. Marge's prowler is parked in an otherwise empty lot. Marge sits talking with two young women at one end of an elevated dance platform. The club, not yet open for business, is deserted. With one last bang we cut. In extreme close-up an insect is lugging a worm. A pull back from the screen reveals that we are in Marge's house. Marge and Norm are watching television in bed. After a long beat, silence except for the TV, Marge murmurs, still looking at the set. Marge gropes in the dark. He sits in and picks up his phone. Jerry sits dumbly. He angrily snatches it up. He goes back to his food. Gary hands her a flimsy. Marge takes it with one hand and looks, her other hand frozen with a forkful of food. Norm, who has been eating steadily throughout, looks over at Marge with mild interest. He stares for a beat as he finishes chewing, and then swallows and says. Jerry, Wade, and Stan Grossman sit around the kitchen table. The scene is harshly toplit by a hanging fixture. On the table the remains of coffee and a cinnamon filbert ring are present. Marge is at the reception desk. The clerk types into a computer console. Marge is on a public phone. The brown Ciera enters and drives lazy S-curves around the few snow-covered cars parked on the roof of the lot. It stops by one car and Carl emerges. He quickly scans the lot, then kneels in the snow at the back of the parked car and starts unscrewing its license plate. Carl pulls up and hands the attendant his ticket. The attendant frowns uncomprehendingly at the ticket. The attendant is still puzzled. The attendant doesn't say anything. Carl glances back, starts digging for money. He is peeling off one dollar bills. Bewildered, he looks about, then asks a mechanic passing by, his voice raised over the din of the shop. The mechanic points. Jerry looks. Jerry stares, swallows. Marge and Shep face each other at the other end of the floor in a grimy and cluttered glassed-in cubicle. Marge and Shep silently talk. Shep says nothing. Shep stares at her. Jerry is worriedly pacing behind his desk. Marge has stuck in the door. Marge plops into the chair opposite him. Jerry stares at her, his mouth open. As Marge rises, Jerry looks blankly down at the papers on the desk in front of him. Marge enters. She looks around the bar, a rather characterless, lowlit meeting place for business people. It is a bald, paunching man of about Marge's age, rising from a booth halfway back.",
    "926": "He takes the metal case and walks out. He hesitates. He clocks her handbag. He opens it without her seeing. She pouts sexily, and gestures to the case. They look through papers as moped guy looks for them. The papers are all blank. There's a guy on a moped behind them. A small car comes flying round a corner. She streaks across the traffic, causing coffins. The moped guy has to stop. The brunette, with high cheek bones, turns the little car into an alley off the road. Their pursuer tries to work out where they've gone. He grabs her wrist as she fires. Then, as the moped gets closer, he jumps out of the car. He turns to see the moped guy approaching. He flips the bike out from under him, kicks him in the face, then rides off. He's a few cars behind the girl. Bond rides impassively, following the girls little bronze car. They arrive at a quay where boats are being unloaded. Furiously she storms past a guard in dark glasses. Bond rides onto the quay, and clocks the guard in a floral shirt, carrying a sub-machine gun. The girl strides into an office as an official stamps a docket. She stands over the Frenchman. The thin German speaker looks nervous. There's a body floating in the water under the quay. A powerful speedboat approaches. He gives the guard a card and looks up at a security camera before walking off. The German in square shades looks at a card from Universal Exports. Bond activates the tracking function on his phone. Pay attention next time. He approaches the heavyset general with the bushy mustache. He holds up a map. The general eyeballs the little Frenchman and takes the map nodding. The girl glares at them. He waves her over. A burly hand grabs her arm. Bond watches with a frown, then rides away. Camille is led to the speedboat. Bond rides through the busy docks standing in the saddle to look around. Dominic waves an ironic goodbye as the boat with Camille on it pulls away. She looks with sultry hatred in his direction. Bond jumps the bike off the quay into a boat. Rides over some crates, jumps onto another boat then abandons the machine. The launch is heading towards a huge luxury cruiser. Bond runs across the closely packed boats crammed with merchandise. He leaps onto a small launch, pulls the starting cord on the outboard motor and starts to shadow the general's boat. He rams the boat. Dominic watches in disbelief as the crew on the cruise grab weapons and jump into an inflatable. Bond boards the launch. Camille grabs a gun but Bond knocks into the water, grabs her and drags her off the boat into his.",
    "930": "Mathis hands him an envelope. Tousle-headed Bond puts down his champagne glass and heads back to the bedroom. He kisses her naked back. She smiles and turns her face towards him. He pulls her back down on to a bed. DJ plays under a full moon. Trays are being served and cocktails sipped. A Range Rover pulls up at the entrance. Bond gets out, accompanied by Fields in a glamorous black and gold dress. He moves through the press of glamorous party goers. He shakes another hand. CIA agent Felix watches from a sofa. They look down from a stone balustrade. She kisses him and he shoves her hard against the crumbling stonework. The thin German arrives. Fields passes. The CIA men are sitting together. He belts up as he goes around to the driver's side of the Range Rover. Motorcyclists follow them. He parks the car. The two motorcycle cops pull up behind. Bond hands over his license to the cop who is wearing dark glasses at night. As he opens it, the cop draws. Mathis is lying in the trunk. Bond pulls the unconscious man out. With his colleague's gun, throws the other down, calmly shoots him and empties the gun and tosses it aside. Bond cradles him in his arms. Camille watches them. His head slumps against Bond's shoulder. Expressionlessly, Bond feels for a pulse. Camille shifts uneasily. He drops the body in a dumpster, removes Mathis' wallet from his jacket, takes out the cash, and tosses the wallet aside. They walk off, leaving the body slumped amid the rubbish bags in the dumpster. The Range Rover heads down a desert highway. M stares coldly. The Range Rover drives through the dusty, barren. It arrives at a small airstrip. The man, in a leather jacket and brimmed hat is. He turns as Bond his jacket to cover a bloodstain on his shirt. Bond looks at an old propeller transport plane as Camille gets out of the car. The ageing DC-3 Dakota lumbers down the runway, raising a cloud of dust in it. The man in a hat is already on the phone as the old plane takes to the air. A fighter streaks past them and banks for another pass. Bond puts the plane into the dive working the controls furiously as the fighter loops to get behind them. The fighter streaks in. Bond flies down into a valley. Camille looks alarmed and Bond concentrates hard as they skim the valley floor. He lowers the under carriage. They hit the ground hard. He pulls the throttle back open. The fighter hurtles down the valley after them, perilously close to a rocky outcrop. Fields gets out of her seat and moves down the plane's fuselage.",
    "936": "Holmes looks up at him. Watson helps Holmes up and supports him as the pair make their way back across the factory floor. They pass several Howitzers, which stand, ready to be shipped out of the factory. They arm themselves. Watson has a machine gun, Holmes a pistol. Watson leads the way. In the ruins, Moran frees Moriarty from the rubble. Sim spots Holmes and Watson. She runs on ahead of them. Holmes sees some guards. Watson opens fire. Watson lays down covering fire as Sim and the gypsies lead the way out of the factory. As Watson retreats and reloads, Holmes shoots a guard dead. He reloads and follows the others out into a rail yard. One of the gypsies is killed by the rough-looking twins. Holmes and Watson return fire, killing them both. The raiders make their way to the perimeter wall of the rail yard and throw a rope over the top of it. Before they can escape, they're spotted by the guards, who open fire, forcing the fugitives to take cover. Watson returns fire with his machine gun, but the guards respond with a heavy-caliber Gatling gun, forcing Watson and the others to take cover behind some crates. A huge artillery piece is turned on them. The shell goes over their heads and blasts a hole in the perimeter wall. Holmes and the others run for it, out into the woods beyond. In the distance, a railway line runs through the trees and a train is approaching. The captain of the guards rallies his troops and sends them through the breach in the perimeter wall to chase the fugitives down. As the guards shoot through the trees at the fugitives, others in the rail yard adjust the elevation on the mortars and open fire. Explosions erupt around Holmes, Watson, and the others. They keep running, heading towards the railway line. Giving chase, Moran picks up a rifle and takes a shot at Watson. The bullet clips his right flank, but he keeps running. Bullets from the guards rip chunks out of the tree trunks. Holmes returns fire with his pistol, hitting a guard in the chest. Massive explosions erupt amongst the trees as Sims sprints forward. The guards give chase. Moran takes another shot, hitting one of the gypsies. Sims sees the man go down but keeps running. Little Hansel is a heavy-caliber artillery piece. A massive shell is loaded into the breach. The elevation of the barrel is adjusted, and a powder charge is loaded. Final adjustments to the barrel elevation are made, and the gun crew chief gives the order to fire.",
    "937": "A lever is pulled, a ratchet releases, and the powder charge is ignited. The massive gun recoils violently as a huge ball of flame erupts from its muzzle. The shock wave blows one of the gun crew's hat off. In the woods, the shell rips through a tree trunk, splintering it into matchwood. It fells another tree just behind Holmes and misses him by a whisker. The shell explodes ahead of him, shattering the trees, filling the air with needle-sharp splinters. The epic blast blows the fugitives off their feet. The guards keep coming, closing in. Holmes lies still for a few moments, temporarily stunned by the blast. As dirt falls on his face, he comes to. He and Watson get to their feet. Watson immediately tackles a guard. As fierce hand-to-hand fighting breaks out, Moran runs towards the fray. A gypsy shoots a guard just before a mortar shell goes off beside Holmes. As he leans against a tree, a guard comes at him. The bullet hits the tree, then the guard tries to bayonet Holmes. Holmes punches the guard away and reloads the guard's rifle. He hands it to Watson, who uses it to shoot Moran as he appears over a rise. Holmes, Watson, Sim, and the surviving gypsies run to the train and scramble into one of the boxcars. As they're doing so, Moran starts to sit up. He examines his injury. As Holmes climbs up into the boxcar, Moran gets his gun and takes several deep breaths. He loads his rifle and takes aim. He shoots one of the gypsies as he tries to board the train. One of the other gypsies watches from the boxcar as his dead comrade is left behind. Moran stares after the train as it carries Holmes and the others to safety. The track winds along a wooded valley. Morning, the train makes its way across a snow-covered plain with craggy mountains in the distance. Sim sits cradling Holmes in her arms as Watson stitches a wound in his own flank. Holmes closes his eyes. Sim regards Holmes with growing concern. She holds her hand in front of his mouth. Concerned, Watson goes over to her and examines Holmes, who's completely unresponsive. A gypsy does so. Watson pumps away at Holmes' chest. He thumps his chest. Still no response. Watson pounds Holmes' chest again. Sim pulls Watson away from Holmes and hugs him tight. The gypsy pats Watson on the shoulder. Watson looks down sadly at Holmes, who lies motionless in the boxcar. Something suddenly occurs to him. Watson opens the leather pouch which Holmes gave him and takes out a vial and hypodermic needle. Watson uncaps the needle and plunges it into Holmes' chest.",
    "939": "Watson watches as Moriarty heads off. The photographer. Holmes is outside on a balcony, drinking from a hip flask. The rocking back fall stumble into the darkness nearby. Moriarty comes out and joins him. Moriarty goes to a table and picks up a chess timing clock. He puts the clock on another table beside a chessboard. Holmes takes a seat in front of the board. Moriarty fetches a blanket and puts it around Holmes' shoulders. Moriarty picks up a second blanket and drapes it around his own shoulders. Holmes and Moriarty both smile. Then Moriarty's expression hardens. He starts by moving a white pawn. He sets the time clock. Inside, Watson and Sim move amongst the guests. Outside on the balcony, Holmes advances a second black pawn on the game of chess. Inside, Watson and Sim meet up again. They look over at the delegates. Holmes' knight takes one of Moriarty's pawns. Moriarty advances a bishop. A man smokes a cigar. Sim studies the faces of the potential assassins. Hyperemic needle is concealed inside an especially-adapted Winchester cartridge case. Watson glances around the photographer about to take the delegates' photo. Watson deliberately knocks a tray of drinks out of a footman's hands. As it crashes onto the marble floor, everyone looks around in surprise except one man in the corner. Watson peers at the man's hairline and notes that he drops his cigar. Sim stares at the man as he steps away from the delegate he was talking to. She looks over at Watson, who nods. The man reaches inside his jacket with his left hand just as Sim steps up to him. Another man continues assembling the hyperemic cartridge. He shoves her aside and draws a gun. Watson tackles him as he takes a shot. Mycroft steps forward and his arms ready. Soldiers drag him away. The hyperemic cartridge is loaded into a weapon. As Rene is dragged away, Moran surreptitiously shoots him with a hyperemic cartridge fired from a gun hidden in his cane. Something occurs to Watson. He runs out of the ballroom and joins the soldiers guarding Rene. He's collapsed. The soldiers allowed him to tend to Rene who's convulsing on the floor. Watson quickly finds a hyperemic dart lodged in Rene's leg. He pulls it out and tastes the compound it's injected. Moran watches with a smile. Sim runs to Rene. Watson spots Moran leaving. He turns back to Rene who's fading fast. On the balcony. Holmes looks troubled. Unsettled, Holmes sits back in his chair. Moriarty shrugs the blanket of her shoulders and gets up on the table. Holmes removes his blanket and looks at the chessboard. Moriarty feels for his notebook and runs his thumb over the top line in his pocket.",
    "94": "Jerry stares at her. Jerry explodes. He is getting angrily off his feet. He is yanking his parka from a hook behind the opened door and grabbing a pair of galoshes. He stamps out the door. Marge stares. After a long moment her stare breaks. She pulls a clipboard toward her. It holds a form from the General Motors Finance Corporation. She glances idly around the office. There is another picture of Jean. Marge looks at it, looks around, for some reason, at the ceiling. She looks idly around. Her look abruptly locks. Jerry makes a left turn into traffic. She grabs the phone and punches in a number. Grimsrud says nothing. Disgusted, Carl pockets the gun and heads for the door. We are pulling Carl as he walks toward the car. Behind him we see the cabin door opening. Carl turns, reacting to the sound. Grimsrud is bounding out wearing mittens and a red hunter's cap, but no overcoat. He is holding an axe. Grimsrud swings overhand, burying the axe in Carl's neck. In her cruiser, on her two-way. Through it we hear Lou's voice, heavily filtered. We are slowing as we approach a short driveway leading down to a cabin. Parked in front is the brown Cutlass Ciera. Grimsrud stares. Conscious of the noise, she shows with a twist of her shoulder the armpatch insignia. With a quick twist, he reaches back for the log, hurls it at Marge and then starts running away. Marge twists her body sideways, shielding herself. Grimsrud pants up the hill - slow going through the deep snow. Behind him. Grimsrud, cheeks sunk, eyes hollow, looks sourly out at the road. She glances up in the rear-view mirror. Grimsrud's head bobs with bumps on the road; otherwise he is motionless, reaction less, scowling and gazing out. Marge, gazing forward, seems to be talking to herself. She glances up in the rear-view mirror. Grimsrud's hollow eyes stare out. Marge pulls over. She leans back with a creak and jangle of utilities. Outside it is snowing. The sky, the earth, the road - all white. She stares forward, shakes her head. A squad car, gum-balls spinning, punches through the white. It approaches in slow motion. An ambulance punches through after it. Another squad car. It stands next to a highway on a snowy, windswept plain. One or two cars dot the parking lot along with an idling police cruiser. We are looking over the shoulders of two uniformed policemen who stand on either side of the door, their hands resting lightly on their holstered sidearms. One of them raps at the door. One of the policemen upholsters his gun and nods to someone whose back enters.",
    "940": "In his mind, he sees the action about to unfold. The men eye their leader, who makes a cutthroat gesture to them. In his mind, Holmes sees a thug with a pocket watch take out a knuckleduster, a knife being thrust at Holmes, another attacker with a knuckleduster, and a third with a club. The gang's leader has a gun. Holmes opens his eyes and lives the action. A blond thug tosses an apple. Holmes thwarts the knife thrust and spins the thug, forcing the blade into another. He throws the man with the club and snatches the gun from the leader's hand. Holmes catches the apple as it falls and tosses it to the hapless leader. Holmes empties the gun and hands it back. He makes to attack the leader, who shrinks back. Holmes jogs off. On foot, Irene Adler enters the auctioneers, Cromwell and Griff. She hands the package to a mature man, who gives her a letter. The doctor starts to open the package. Irene rises. He holds her back. She sits. Holmes stops a sprung switch. Holmes kisses her and teases the letter from her. The doctor removes a banknote from the package, revealing dynamite. His pipe ignites a tapestry. The auction house clears. Irene heads out. She tries to retrieve the letter. Irene goes. Holmes takes the ticking package from the doctor. He runs to the sarcophagus. The bomb exploded in the closed sarcophagus. The doctor has gone. Outside, the scruffy Holmes draws glances from a well-dressed queue of people. A bearded man in a tweed suit watches him closely. Holmes turns, and the man looks away. Holmes, the back of his Oriental jacket covered in dust from the explosion, spots the doctor slumped against a wall. He feels for a pulse, then notices a tiny dart in the man's thigh. He examines the dart, then turns. The bearded man has disappeared. Holmes places the dart in his bag. The elaborately embossed ceiling of a grand restaurant. Irene Adler is led to a table in the center of the restaurant and sits by a curtain, shielding her from a nearby table. She turns to the waiter. From the table behind the curtain. Her tea is poured. The bearded man in the tweed suit watches the speaker. The bearded man clinks a teaspoon against a glass, and all the clientele and staff, with the exception of him and the man behind the curtain, rise and leave the dining room. Irene stops sipping her tea and looks anxiously around as the place empties. The man behind the curtain draws it open. Irene closes her eyes, then glances down at her cup. The man has a rattled face and sports a beard.",
    "942": "Mycroft winces. As Watson enjoys himself at the gaming tables and Mycroft chats to some other men, Holmes goes upstairs to investigate where he saw a bearded man carrying a nosegay appear from behind the curtains earlier. Holmes parts the curtains and sees nosegays lying on a table. A woman stands with her back to him. He puts coins in a shell-shaped bowl. The high cheekboned brunette turns around. Holmes sits. Madam Sim lights a match from a candle. She picks up a pack of tarot cards. Holmes stares intently at the pack and places a finger on his forehead. He takes the pack from her and flicks through them. He lays the Devil card down on the table. Holmes reaches inside his jacket and takes out the letter. He drops it on the table. Sim looks amazed and picks it up. Inside is a sketch of a man with a goatee beard. That is the price I must pay to change the course of history. She looks up from the letter. He gives her a look and gets up. She reaches for a gun. He picks up an umbrella and in his mind, plans his attack on the Corsac. He swings the brolly, and the Corsac drops down. He knocks a knife from the man's hand. In slow motion, Holmes karate-chops the Corsac about the face. A kick in the groin. Holmes bludgeons the man with the brolly. The Corsac lunges with a knife. Holmes dodges the attack and hooks the umbrella handle around the man's throat. He throws the man over his shoulder and whacks him in the face. Now, for real, Holmes pulls the Corsac down from the rafters with the umbrella and disarms him. Sim kills the Corsac by throwing a knife into his chest. Holmes goes over to her. As Holmes and Sim leave, a man and two couples come in. The Corsac comes round and leaps to his feet. He takes off his heavy coat in which Sim's knife is embedded. Brandishing another blade, he goes after Holmes and Sim. He runs along the edge of a balcony within the building. He somersaults off it down to a lower level, and heads off Holmes and Sim. Holmes throws the Corsac, who back-flips off a wall and comes at him again. Meanwhile, on the ground floor, Watson is still playing cards. At least he's winning. Sim whacks the Corsac over the head with a bottle. Holmes twists his arm and throws him onto a sofa. They struggle, and the Corsac's blade scrapes Holmes' cheek. Holmes recoils. The Corsac goes after Sim. Holmes gives chase and tackles him to the floor. The Corsac springs up and grabs Sim by the hair.",
    "949": "The boys pick themselves up. In the main body of the bus, a technical sergeant has been knocked cold. Nelec picks himself up. Joe tries to open the back door. The alien rocks the bus as Nelec gets on the radio. Joe tries to open the holding cell door but it's locked. Nelec comes to the door. A tentacle reaches in and crushes the driver. Joe pounds on a cracked window above them. Nelec loads an assault rifle. Joe breaks the window with his elbow and climbs out onto the side of the bus. At the front, the giant spider like alien is busy trying to reach in to get Nelec. Joe helps Martin out of the broken window followed by Charles, and then Carrie. Nelec fires at the alien with the assault rifle as it forces its way into the bus. The boys clamor down from the vehicle and run off the road to cover. The alien closes in on Nelec apparently undeterred by the automatic fire. Nelec runs out of ammunition. The alien lunges at him with his needle sharp teeth. Lying in a ditch, the boys watch as the alien leaps of the bus and disappears into the woods. Air Force soldiers grab Louis in the evacuation center. Joe retrieves his locket from Overmyer's body. A car pulls up. He clocks the red bus. Joe drives Donnie's car back into town. Donnie has nodded off. A tank opens fire on them and Joe swerves to avoid the incoming round. More tanks close in. The boys get out of the car and flee. A soldier into his radio. The boys run. They hurry through a back garden shoving a washing line out of their way. They leap a fence then race through a gate onto the street. They see a tank being overturned. Soldiers flee from their own malfunctioning machines which randomly spray shells, missiles, and bullets around them. The boys flee through a playground from an out of control tank. They hurry up a hill and take refuge in a house as the tank smashes up the playground. The boys hurry upstairs in the house. Joe looks out of a window. A shell strikes the house and the blast knocks the boys to the ground. They get back up. Charles is about to strap up Martin's leg, which has been broken in the explosion. Joe and Cary run to the building in the cemetery, where Joe saw earth being thrown about. They try all the doors, but they're firmly locked. They break the doors open and step inside. A tunnel leads into the Earth. Cary unzips his bag. A bunch of fireworks spill out. Joe lights one of the sparklers and tosses it into the tunnel.",
    "95": "He opens a box of chocolates and holds it out for the nurse. The nurse shakes her head, a bit apprehensive about this strange man next to her. Forrest eats a chocolate as he looks down at the nurse's shoes. The black woman stares at Forrest as he looks down at his own shoes. Forrest closes his eyes tightly. A little boy closes his eyes tightly. It is young Forrest as he sits in a doctor's office. Forrest has been fitted with orthopedic shoes and metal leg braces. The doctor sets Forrest down on its feet. Forrest walks around stiffly. Forrest's mother, MRS. GUMP, watches him as he clanks around the room awkwardly. Forrest walks foreground past the doctor and Mrs. Gump. A loud thud is heard as, outside, Forrest falls. Mrs. Gump and young Forrest walk across the street. Forrest walks stiffly next to his mother. A black and white photo of General Nathan Bedford Forrest. The photo turns into live action as the General dons a hooded sheet over his head. The General is in full Ku Klux Klan garb, including his horse. The General rides off, followed by a large group of Klan members dressed in full uniform. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk across the street. Forrest stops suddenly as his brace gets stuck. Forrest's brace is caught in a gutter grate. Mrs. Gump bends down and tries to free Forrest. Two old cronies sit in front of a barber shop and watch. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the sidewalk past the two old men. Mrs. Gump holds tightly onto Forrest's hand. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along a dirt road. A row of mailboxes stands left. Mrs. Gump and Forrest walk along the Gump Boarding House driveway. Mrs. Gump heads Forrest to the porch. She bends down to look Forrest in the eye. The principal sighs, then stands up. Forrest sits outside the principal's office and waits. The principal stands in front of Mrs. Gump. Forrest, sitting left, listens. Forrest sits outside the principal's office. Loud organic male grunts are heard coming from inside the house. Forrest sits on a swing outside the house. Forrest sits on the swing as the grunts continue. The principal steps out of the Gump House and wipes the sweat from his face. Forrest is sitting on the porch. The principal wipes the sweat from his neck, then looks back at Forrest. Forrest grunts, imitating him. The principal, embarrassed, turns and walks away. Forrest lies down on his bed and looks up. A cab driver closes the trunk of the car as two women walk toward the house. A milkman steps down from the porch. A MAN WITH A CANE steps left across the hall.",
    "950": "A Jeep motors along a quiet dark road. Jack is driving. Louis sits beside him. A troubled expression on his face, Louis looks over at Jack. Jack keeps his eyes unflinchingly on the road ahead, but deep emotions boil beneath the surface. Louis looks over at Jack, who gives him the briefest of glances. They stand at the edge of the pit, looking down. It falls about 30 feet before touching the bottom. At the cemetery, Joe and Cary climb down a rope into the tunnel that the alien has built. At the bottom, they light another sparkler and look around the gloomy tunnel. They hurry down the large bore tunnel. Up ahead is faint flickering light. Joe and Cary round a corner in the tunnel. Up ahead of them is a massive chamber cut into the subterranean rocks. They cautiously edge closer and peer into it. It's full of machinery and some kind of industrial scale construction is taking place. As they creep a bit closer, they come across the sheriff hanging upside down from the roof of the tunnel. He's either dead or unconscious. Joe claps his hand over Cary's mouth to stop him from screaming. More bodies hang from the ceiling. They look round at the bodies, all suspended upside down from the ceiling. None of them is moving. The alien appears in the chamber. They watch as it does something behind some machinery. They notice the creature is holding what appears to be a severed human leg. It scuttles off. Joe spots Alice dangling upside down. Joe hurries away back up the tunnel, using a sparkler to light his way. Cary empties out his bag of pyrotechnics. Joe arrives at a fork in the tunnel and chooses which way to go. Cary selects some suitably noisy fireworks and watches as the alien sets to work on whatever it is it's building. Alice is still dangling, motionless, upside down. The fork in the tunnel brings Joe out quite close to her. He watches as the alien continues with its work. Cary tries to get his lighter to spark up. The alien carries on working, oblivious to Cary or Joe. It stops what it's doing and takes Alice down from where she's hanging. Joe watches with mounting alarm. Cary finally sparks his Zippo into life. He lights a firecracker and leaves it beside a pile of other fireworks, then legs it off back down the tunnel. The alien puts Alice down and immediately goes to investigate the noise. Joe breaks cover and runs over to Alice, who lies un-moving on the chamber floor. She's completely unresponsive. Joe hesitates, then slaps her hard. She wakes. She stares at him, then hugs him, tight.",
    "951": "Joe looks taken aback, but pleasantly so. A girl, Tina, sits up nearby. They carefully lower the sheriff. The alien runs along the dark tunnel in pursuit of Cary, who flees up ahead of it. The alien suddenly stops in its tracks. The sheriff is up on his feet. Joe, Alice and Tina follow the sheriff through the alien's maze of equipment. The sheriff shines his flashlight ahead of them. Cary rounds the corner. The alien grabs the sheriff. The others flee. Bringing up the rear, Tina is snatched by the creature and pulled back into the darkness. It comes after Joe and the others. The three friends run on down a dark tunnel until they come to a dead end and are forced to stop. The alien emerges from the shadows. Alice and Cary cower back from it. Joe stands his ground as it draws closer. The alien draws itself up to its full height of about 25 feet and Joe steps towards it. The alien cocks its head to one side. The others look on in horror as the alien picks Joe up. It holds him close to its face to get a look at him. The creature has a skull-like face with huge mandibles. The alien's breath ruffles Joe's hair as it breathes on him. It leans in close and retracts some protective membranes from over its eyes and its expression softens. Hearing the machinery, the alien looks away for a moment, then turns back to Joe. Alice watches warily as the alien puts Joe back on the ground. It turns and runs away back up the tunnel, on its many legs. Joe stares after it, catching his breath. Now back on the surface, Joe, Alice and Cary join troops on a street in town. Strange magnetic force pulls metal items up off the ground and draws them towards the water tower. A bin, oil barrels, a table lamp, a bicycle and numerous other objects are all drawn irresistibly towards the tower. The items stick to the side of the structure. A shop window bursts open and television sets are hoovered up into the air. A soldier finds his rifle relentlessly drawn to the tower. He hangs onto it and is lifted up off the ground. He's pulled about 20 feet into the air before letting go. A car rises up out of the used car lot. Suddenly, the back of one of the military container lorries bursts open and the white cubes flood out of it. Joe, Alice and Cary have to dive onto the ground as the cubes pass overhead. The cubes, cars and other bits and pieces begin to fuse together, forming a gigantic structure on top of the tower.",
    "952": "Joe, Alice, and Cary pick themselves up and watch as a steady stream of metallic bits and pieces stream up towards the water tower and are melded into the ever-growing structure on top of it. Alice smiles as the vast structure begins to take shape. A Jeep drives up and Joe sees his dad and Louis get out of it. Jack looks up at the water tower, then spots Joe. Joe nudges Alice, who looks round and sees her dad with Jack. The dads walk towards them and Joe and Alice go to meet them. Jack cups Joe's face in his hands, then hugs him tight, their faces tense with a mixture of emotion and relief. Eyes closed, they hold each other tight. Alice looks over at her father as he steps up to her. They regard each other for a moment, then hug. Joe looks over Jack's shoulder at the water tower and sees the alien climbing up it. The creature steps into the now fully formed spaceship it's created on top of the water tower and the door closes behind it. The spaceship powers up and several arms on it rotate. Many bright lights on the arms shine out. Joe separates from his father and is just in time to grab his mother's locket, which is being drawn towards the tower. It hangs in the air, pulled by an invisible force. The locket clicks open, revealing the picture inside, which is of Joe's mother, holding him as a baby. Joe lets go of the locket's chain and it floats up towards the water tower. Joe and the others watch as the locket sticks to the side of the tower. Suddenly, the tower explodes in a shower of water, deluging the street below. The spaceship, which resembles the canopy of a palm tree, lifts into the air. The water tower collapses and crashes down into the street, scattering soldiers standing there, and crushing their vehicles. He, Joe, Alice, Louis, and Jack watch as the spacecraft gains altitude in a blaze of bright lights. Hobbling through town, Charles and Martin sit sailing up into the night sky. Still stoned in his car, Donny slumbers on as the spaceship flies by, its lights reflected in his windshield. As they watch it recede into the distance, Joe and Alice hold hands. Smiles spread across their faces. The spacecraft becomes a dot of light high up in the sky. Gradually, it becomes a pinpoint and then dies away altogether. A chalk outline of a body is drawn on the floor. Martin arrives as the detective and talks to a witness. At Romero Chemicals. Martin gets up and puts his hat on. Preston, as the President, makes a call.",
    "954": "It crashes into the Earth a little distance away. Noises emanate from the stricken carriage almost as if some angry beast were charging around inside it. On the remains of the platform, the Cinay camera runs out of film. The yellow Coupe, still largely unscathed, sits in the middle of the devastation. Joe makes his way past it, looking for the others. He climbs up onto some twisted railway tracks. He sees Preston. Thumbs up. Joe spots a blood stain. Joe walks slowly towards the ominous blood stain. The others gather round. Alice appears a little way behind them. Seeing her, Joe smiles. Joe turns back to the blood stained wreckage. He retrieves his makeup box. Alice sees the locket he's holding. He quickly stuffs it in his pocket. Joe picks up one of the strange white cubes which have spilled from the wreckage and pockets it before joining the others on top of a wrecked carriage. They have a good view across the devastation. Joe points to the mangled remains of the white pickup truck. They get down from the carriage. There's a guy at the wheel of the pickup. Alice approaches the un-moving black guy. The boys watch as Alice draws closer to him. She touches his arm and it hangs limply. A document spills from his hand. Alice picks it up and opens it as the boys crowd round. It's a map. Dr. Woodward grabs the map. He sits up stiffly. He looks round at the kids. Woodward pulls out a revolver. People are coming. The kids flee. Alice runs to the Coupe. The boys salvage their stuff including the camera. The boys run back to the car and they all scramble in. Alice drive them away as a large score of men in military uniforms brandishing guns and torches arrive on the scene. The soldiers stare after the car. One of the soldiers picks up a discarded Super 8 film box and studies it. He looks up thoughtfully. In the car. Back in town, the boys get out of the car. Alice hands Joe the white cube he took from the crash site. Their faces grimed from the explosions, Alice and Joe regard each other for a moment. Then Alice gets into the Coupe's driving seat and heads off. Joe and the others watch her go. At home, Joe sits in the bath, clutching the white cube, which has a knobbly surface. He stares thoughtfully into the distance. Seen from a hillside, the lights of Lillian twinkle in the darkness. The next morning, Joe is asleep in bed. Later, he puts out dog food. Clutching a script, he runs over to the Kaznyk's house. Joe joins Charles, who's watching the TV.",
    "956": "He stumbles and runs back into the shop. Something comes after him. It smashes the windows, knocking him to the floor, then grabs him, dragging him back. Next day, Joe is making Alice up as one of the un-dead. Alice gives Joe a questioning look. She nods pensively. The lights in the room flickered. Alice adopts a dead-eyed zombie persona and lurches slowly towards Joe. Waving her arms around jerkily, she draws closer. She lunges at him, pretending to bite his neck. They regard each other, smiling. Alice goes. Charles had been watching them. Jack is at the wrecked gas station. The manager of the station, Eddie, is with him. The sheriff's car is missing from the scene, but fragments of its lights remain. On a used car lot, the engines have been stolen from all the cars. Jack watches suspiciously as a convoy of military lorries passes by on the road. In the back of one, he notes some airmen operating some kind of radio listening device. As dusk approaches, Joe cycles beside a pylon in a field as he looks for his dog. He gets off his bike and looks around. Back in town, Joe cycles up beside a community bulletin board and sticks a flyer on it. As he looks at the board, something strikes him. He takes a step back and sees that the entire board is covered in flyers for lost dogs of all shapes and sizes. Joe returns home to find Jack at the dinner table with his other deputies, Tally, Mina, Rosko, Ross and Jay. Joe drops a torch. The cops look round. The lights flicker. Jack gets on his radio. A telecom engineer's truck drives along a dark road. Rooney is working on a power line outside a junkyard. He works from the cherry picker on the back of his truck. A noise emanates from the junkyard and he looks over at it for a moment, then gets back on with his job. Bits of scrap fly up into the air from the junkyard. Rooney watches with mounting concern as a huge hunk of junk sails overhead and lands in the road. It's a cooker. Rooney operates the controls for his cherry picker and gets it to raise him higher so that he can get a better view of the junkyard. The activity in the yard appears to have stopped. As he peers into the gloom, Rooney notices the headlights of his truck and the streetlight nearby start to flicker. The cherry picker has stopped working. Something suddenly lunges out of the trees and grabs him, jolting his truck and breaking the windscreen. Jack is addressing a meeting of concerned locals. Jack glares at Louis as one of the other deputies leads him away.",
    "961": "Now in a black star-sprinkled sky, a sliver of sunlight crests the Earth. Rays of light shoot off the continents, and a golden word orbits into view. Now letters rain down into two boxes, spelling out a logo. Now in a shadowy stone hallway. A lone figure stands under a vaulted ceiling, silhouetted against a wrought iron and plate glass door. In a fine overcoat, he twiddles a wrapped cough drop in his fingers. Now constituents wave signs. Later David greets suburbanites. Now David rides on a Coast Guard boat as it takes a high splash. In the country, David talks with a farmer, then appears with Mayor Bloomberg outside City Hall. In a bar. Now, before a huge crowd. He chats with Madeleine Albright, Wesley Clark and Jesse Jackson. Outside Fordham University's Keating Hall, a young man in the crowd claps, his gaze sternly interested. He wears a newsboy cap, V-neck, and tie. David smiles at his many supporters. Now indoors, an aide runs to David's campaign chairman. Charlie slaps the newspaper shut. Elsewhere, the young and the newsboy cap studies a slim, hardcover book. He folds it shut, and answers his cell phone. He works his lips under his trim dusting of a moustache. Now in a conservative hotel suite, David steps into view, toting a satchel and duffel bag. He later removes a folder from the satchel and flips it open. Later still, its contents lie untouched on a table as David stares out a window at the city. He gloomily peers toward the sitting area, then picks up a TV remote and hits a button. David watches from the couch. Now on a downtown rooftop, four gentlemanly figures cross to the guard rail, each in a fedora, overcoat and necktie. One is the mustached young man. The eldest one speaks. The older member looks briefly at his mustached peer. In the suite, Charlie joins David. Charlie aims the remote at the TV. Charlie tosses a tie at David. He eyes its blue and red stripes. Later, Charlie and David hang their heads. A woman hands off a slip of paper. David strides off. Charlie catches up to him. David leaves the Elegant Function Room. Then a newscast shows on a TV. Now David stands alone in a grand formal hallway. Head bowed, he holds his hands in his pockets. Later he enters a stately Men's Room. He studies note cards. Switching views over time show David at varying spots on the polished marble floor. He washes his hands. David straightens his New York shaped lapel pin. David looks to the row of closed stall doors. One opens. A lovely woman in a silk spaghetti-strap dress with a black lace bodice emerges bashfully.",
    "963": "He holds her for another moment, then pulls away and glances at her. He forces a faint smile. Elise gives him a tender look. He turns away, and she watches him with concerned eyes. As he trudges out of the emergency room, a discouraged expression crosses her face. Exiting the ER, David walks down a corridor, his pained eyes staring straight ahead. A view from behind shows his lone form filing down the long hospital hallway. Now in a vast hallway lined with marble, Richardson joins Harry at a window overlooking New York City. Harry's gaze stays trained ahead. Meanwhile, Elise sits alone in the hospital waiting room. She blinks back tears, then shakes her head. Now a friend pushes Elise in a wheelchair. They head out. Harry gives him a skeptical look. Richardson puts on his fedora, gives Harry a pat on the arm, and walks off, leaving the younger officer alone at the window of the mid-century high-rise. 11 months later, now on a sunny farm, David walks a green pasture. Later, in front of a barn and silos, he addresses a crowd. Sitting in a campaign bus, Charlie and an aide watch a news report on the vehicle's TV. Charlie heads outside. As David greets his supporters, the campaign chairman sits on a picnic table and reads a newspaper. He browses a page, folds it up, and frowns thoughtfully to himself. As voters disperse, David joins him. Charlie holds out the newspaper. An arts section feature shows photos of Elise, one dancing, the other with a bow. David stares at the photo, his brow cinched. As he leaves, Charlie gazes after him with pursed lips. Seated outside a waterfront warehouse, he wears a sober frown. Now under a dusky sky, David walks across a deserted shipping dock. He carelessly tracks his feet through a large glassy puddle and stops at the dock's edge, gazing toward the low sun. In her apartment, Elise sits at the foot of her bed, eyeing a document. She sets it aside, then lifts her troubled gaze. Now David approaches the ragged bar. As David disappears inside, Harry emerges from a neighboring door. Inside, David sits forlornly at the bar. The bartender hands him a slip of paper. David stares after her, then reads the note. At dusk, under pouring rain, he holds his jacket over his head as he runs along a dock to a warehouse. In the evening, he leans on the wall, waiting. Harry arrives in a fedora and trench coat, sheltered from the rain by an umbrella. He joins David. Harry lowers his gaze and takes a deep breath. He gives a grave shake of the head, then takes a seat on a stack of shipping pallets.",
    "966": "David halts an oncoming car by holding up a hand and pulls Elise safely across the street. Fording through it, he leads Elise out onto a grassy island. Looking up, she sees the Statute of Liberty towering above. David spots a pair of doors, crosses to them and faces Elise. Elise's eyes pool with tears. She hangs her head and then takes in David's earnest expression. A tear rolls down her cheek. She swallows and nodes bravely. Elise goes to him and takes his hand. They face a set of double doors. David takes hold of the right hand knob. They turn the knobs and the doors open to a long hallway with a polished marble floor. As they enter, the doors shut behind them. On the street Thompson and his aide gawk. Their plan book shows David and Elise's pathway has united and intermittent red dots flash in a column. At the bureau, Harry reads the same in his plan book. With a grave look, he steps away. David and Elise push open a pair of doors and enter the bureau reading room. David knocks a staffer out of the way. Leaving Elise behind him, he shoves another. They race along a walkway bordering the room. David finds a door and they hurry through. Thompson and his staff enter the reading room. Bureau members stare as they march down the center aisle. Meanwhile, David and Elise hurry up a palatial spiral staircase. In the reading room, Thompson leads his team to the peripheral walkway, then the door. David glances upward. The flights of stairs seem to continue infinitely. Now in a white marble hall. The staffer holds out a large manila envelope. Harry grimly takes it, heads back down the hall and turns out of view. Now a black garbed intervention team passes through a columned archway. Thompson and his staff jog up the spiraling stairway. At a landing he slides open a door of bronze bars. Now David and Elise reach a hallway. He takes her hand and they hurry on. David peers over his shoulder. They reach a door, glance about, and go through. In a green-carpeted office, a bookish receptionist looks up. The two intruders run through a series of identical offices. David offers a staffer a cordial wave as he and Elise proceed through the offices. Now the black clad intervention team marches into a records archive where rows of bookcases shelve white-spine volumes. David and Elise arrive in another identical records room. Reaching the far end, they find two intervention teams approaching. David leads Elise through more of the bafflingly connected records rooms. Finding a dark green door framed in green marble, he desperately yanks it open.",
    "969": "He slams down the receiver, then creeps to the hallway door. The other door opens. The helmeted men grab David. As he struggles, they wrestle him to the floor and flip him on his back, holding him down. The mustached stranger crouches down. He presses a cloth to David's face. David's view fades to black. Through groggy eyes, he sees the helmeted men carrying him under a high ceiling with bright lights. Later, he finds himself in a stark warehouse. He finds his wrists bound. The white-haired boss uses a phone. He hangs up. They eye David, who sits in a chair. He consults the book. The balding man meets his gaze. The white-haired man smiles at David. He steps over. David bolts and frees his wrists. A point of a finger from Richardson telekinetically lifts a floor tile, tripping David. Two men in body suits grab him under his arms and drag him back to his chair. The mustached stranger observes. David presses his hands to his face and rocks himself. He aims the scold at his underling. As four men exit an SUV, Richardson sits facing David. David's jaw hangs slack. He shifts his eyes. Richardson stands. A man removes his chair. He stares down at David, who nods. Two men grab David. They restrain his arms. Richardson's boyish partner finds the business card in David's wallet. Richardson lights it on fire. Fire consumes the card. The boyish man returns David's wallet. Richardson drops the blazing card. He points a finger at David and waits. Two men escort David to a door. Richardson watches as the men lift David off his feet and toss him through, head first. David lands in Charlie's office. As one door closes, Charlie enters from the other. David stares. David opens the other door, but finds only the small conference room. David scrutinizes his friend. Charlie hangs up his phone. With a puzzled look, David steps into the conference room. Charlie fixes a crooked picture on the wall. As David heads out, Charlie gapes at him, then follows. At the foot of some stairs, the receptionist, Susan, smiles. David shoots an uneasy look at her. Later, in the conference room. Sitting at the long table, David blinks his bemused eyes. As a handful of colleagues listen to a woman's analysis, Charlie paces thoughtfully. He gives a faint shrug. David's eyes focus on Charlie. He smiles, then shifts his gaze to David, who stares at him with a confused expression. Blinking, David focuses, then shrugs his hands. Now David stares at a secretary on a phone as he and a friend pass her cubicle. Charlie leads him inside. Leaning on his desk, he folds his arms.",
    "971": "Turning the corner, he runs down another street and catches up to Elise as she makes another turn on foot. She stops. She grins. Elise squirms, taking a breath, then eyes him. Now, a man runs down a corridor. It's the boyish officer. He opens a door marked Mr. Richardson and finds the veteran officer at his desk. The messenger shows a map book. He grabs his brown fedora. In the hall, he passes Harry who doffs his hat. The boyish officer now sporting his own hat follows Richardson through a door. They arrive in a cafe co-room and spy David and Elise. The boyish officer checks his map book. A host sits them. His book shows pulsing red dots. Outside, David glances aside. At their outdoor table, Elise smiles to herself and peeks at David. The officers share a table. David glances around as a server fills his water glass. Outside, Richardson and his aide follow a walkway to a spot overlooking the outdoor dining area. The aide checks his map book. A red inflection point pulses larger. Charlie arrives. A third officer arrives. Charlie pays the check. Elise grins at David. Richardson and his aide look on. David and Elise go to kiss. Richardson triggers a text to Charlie. His interjection prevents the kiss. David nods amiably, then gives Elise a long kiss on the cheek. A relieved Richardson bows his head. She nods smiling radiantly. Later, by the Brooklyn Bridge. David exits a Town Car and shakes many hands. David takes the podium before a crowd of hundreds. The gathering overlooks the East River. Richardson's aide gets a text. We just moved the rehearsal back to Cedar Lake. David peers across the river to Pier 17. In a quaint eclectic apartment, Elise puts on a hoodie and picks up her cell. A text message reads. Rehearsal back at Cedar Lake, not Pier 17. David's senate race gathering wraps up. David spies Richardson in a window. Both Adjustment officers duck out of sight. David frowns at the Pier 17 structures across the river. Richardson pouts. David stares at the now empty window. Now, a large water taxi crosses the river. David rides aboard it as the skipper pilots it to the pier. David hurries onto the platform and up some stairs. He follows a covered walkway alongside a commercially refurbished warehouse. Finding a studio door chain-locked, he makes a call on his cell. David checks his phone. It reads disconnected, call failed, searching for signal. With a determined gaze, David jogs off the pier. Richardson and his aide observe. The officers follow David in the map book. Now, David rounds a corner, coming face to face with the two officers.",
    "972": "David walks on. They accompany him. David eyes the boyish officer who promptly closes his map book. Under David's unwavering gaze, Richardson frowns a little. David crosses the street to a bistro. The boyish aide checks his book. The Adjustment officers watch David stride briskly outside. Now, David stands by the curb and hails an approaching cab. Its roof light switches to off duty as it drives by. David tries again. A mini-van taxi ignores him. David jogs out into the opposite lane, waving high for another cab that passes him up. Richardson and his aide stand casually by. David jogs away. Richardson and his aide swap a thoughtful look. In his dress shoes, David sprints after a cab. As the cabbie waves and slows, a sedan crashes into his passenger side. David runs over to the damaged cars. David glances to the sedan driver who checks the bloody-faced cabbie. David checks on the other driver. David makes a call. David goes to another cop. The rebuffed cop looks to Richardson, then walks away. They both look aside, but find no one. David strides off, leaving an ambulance and a squad car behind. He checks his watch, takes a few more brisk steps, then breaks into a run. A taxi stops. As they near a traffic light, it changes from green to red. The surrounding cars stop. A man and a woman in the crosswalk scurry out of their way. David sees Richardson and his aide emerge from a door. The taxi leaves the Adjustment Bureau servants behind. In a pub, the officers detour through a side door which ports them to a street. The hostess hurries after them, but finds only a coat closet. The Bureau officers try a residential door, but finds Central Park on the other side. They race up the steps of a townhouse. As David's cab cruises through another intersection, the Bureau officers run through an art gallery bumping a bystander. Heading outside, they see David exit the cab and enter a building. Richardson's hat blows off. As Richardson enters, David opens a door and sees Elise executing a graceful sidestep. Richardson catches his breath. He makes eye contact with David. The boyish aide hands him a cellphone. As Richardson walks off, David's gaze returns to Elise. David stares at Elise. She partners with a man who holds her waist in one hand. Elise balances on one foot, bends over, and briefly flutters her other foot high behind her. As the male dancer dips in a far stepping lunge, Elise rolls fluidly over his back. David enters the studio. Outside, Richardson walks beside a marble facade. He pulls open a brass lobby door, and disappears into a midcentury high-rise, its window's number in the hundreds ascending into the sky, story after story after story.",
    "985": "A maid stands in his way. He pushes her aside and leans into the cot to uncover the infant. Suddenly horrified, Thomas gags. The priest sprinkles holy water on the dying mother. Thomas snatches the baby from its cot and runs. He hurries downstairs. Thomas bounds out of the house, cradling the baby, which is wrapped in a blanket. He tears through the street, stumbling as he pushes past revelers, one of whom swigs from a bottle of booze. Clutching the baby, he stops at the edge of a darkened river. Panting, he turns to see a policeman emerge from a nearby warehouse. The policeman holds a lantern. Thomas looks left along the river path, then breaks into a run. The policeman blows his whistle as he gives chase. Thomas runs into the gloom behind the warehouses and comes out in a dimly lit road. He weaves between slow-moving traffic and scurries into the shadows. The policeman glances left and right, then gathers speed, as Thomas darts through a gateway in a concrete wall. Holding the baby close, he secrets himself in the shadows and glances back to see the policeman hurry past. Thomas heaves a sigh of relief and steps forward into a pool of light emanating from a nearby window. Trembling he turns a corner and approaches the back steps of a clapboard building. He stoops down and puts the baby on the fourth step, then takes money from his jacket and slips it into the baby's blanket. He hides as a young black couple step out onto the back porch. The bespectacled man watches as the woman dabs herself with a cloth. She stifles a smile. Thomas leaves. The man, Tizzy, strikes a pose in his fine suit and bowler hat. The baby lies just feet away on the steps. Queenie opens the blanket to reveal the baby, which has an old and very wrinkled face. She gasps, and Tizzy covers his mouth. Queenie steps closer to inspect it. She carries the baby into the house. Tizzy follows. She heads for her room. It's in the basement. Queenie closes her door on the old lady, who's wearing a pearl necklace, then peels the blanket from over the baby's face. She opens the top drawer of a dresser, places the baby in it, and half-closes the drawer. She opens her room door to Mrs. Hollister. A doctor stands over an aged resident. Two white-haired old women laugh. Queenie quietly approaches Dr. Rose and whispers in his ear. He inspects the baby. He turns to Queenie. They stare down at the naked baby. She carries the baby into the retirement home lounge. She adjusts the blanket. She stares down at him.",
    "989": "Benjamin turns the ship's wheel. Mike grips a cigar between his teeth. Grinning, Mike takes the helm and sharply steers the boat left. Mike and Benjamin stand at the bar in a shady watering hole. Mike sips his liquor. He removes his shirt. He has tattoos over his torso. He strikes a boxing pose with tattoos on it. He kisses his tattooed bicep. Mike grins at Benjamin. A bevy of prostitutes is gathered on the stairs. A beautiful woman steps forward. They climb the stairs. The woman emerges wearily from beneath the rapidly moving covers. Under the sheets. He leaves. Benjamin trots down the stairs and out through the back door, past two scantily clad hookers. As he disappears into a crowded back alley, his father, Thomas, leaves a hooker outside an adjacent building and spots Benjamin. Thomas's motorcar pulls up beside Benjamin as he strolls down a rain-washed street. He considers. Thomas sports a neat mustache. He opens a door to Benjamin, who climbs in. The car pulls away, and Thomas turns to regard his son. Thomas smiles. A waiter. Thomas and Benjamin sit down at a table. The waiter addresses Benjamin. Two whiskeys. Thomas looks away. Thomas and Benjamin clink glasses. Thomas smiles wryly as Benjamin sputters on the whiskey. Later, the bar staff are clearing up. Thomas raises his glass. Thomas coughs his whiskey and grimaces. Benjamin slugs his whiskey. Thomas delivers Benjamin to his front gate. He raises his fedora and teeters towards the front door. Benjamin staggers through the darkened hallway, where Queenie stands with her arms folded. He spasms, then vomits. Daisy is now about nine years old. Very early, Benjamin tiptoes into her room and wakes her. She nods. Daisy joins Benjamin outside in the early morning light. Benjamin sprints on ahead of Daisy. They arrive at Captain Mike's tugboat. The tattooed mariner lies in a deep, alcohol-induced slumber. Mike comes round. Benjamin shakes his head. Mike eyes Daisy. Mike rubs his bare, tattooed chest, then sits up and shoves a cigar in his mouth. The tug makes its way along the river through a thick fog. Benjamin and Daisy stand at the prow, looking out. Benjamin, who wears a woolen hat, glances back at Daisy. In the wheelhouse, Mike sips coffee from an enamel. He peers through the window and sees an ocean liner passing the other way. Daisy and Benjamin climb the steps up to the wheelhouse. Daisy waves to the larger vessel. She and Benjamin share a smile. In the hospital, Caroline turns to Daisy. Daisy stares towards the window. Lightning flashes outside. Caroline sits down with the diary and reads. Benjamin stares at himself in the mirror. Benjamin stares at Mrs. Maple, who sits motionless in a chair, her head resting against the seat back, her eyes dull, her mouth slightly open.",
    "996": "Myrtle lands dead in the road with a gash in her chest. Daisy and Gatsby drive on. The other driver gets out and stares at the scene. The eyes on the ragged billboard for the oculist, a Dr. T.J. Eckleburg, stare blankly in the darkness. Tom drives up with Nick and Jordan. Later, police have arrived. They get out and walk towards Wilson's garage, where a crowd has gathered. Tom sees a bereft Wilson and frowns with concern. Policemen hold the crowd back. One of them lays a sheet over Myrtle's body, which lies on a table. Tom steps closer. Tom reaches out and pulls the sheet back, revealing Myrtle's blood-spattered corpse. He gasps and Nick removes his cap. Tom just stares. Tom holds his hand up to the cop. Tearful, Tom shakes his head and looks at Nick. Tom stands, his head bowed. Tom restrains Wilson. The old cop frowns dubiously. The cop walks away. Wilson sits looking dazed. Tom sits facing him and hands him a drink. Tom stares at him. With tears rolling down his face, Wilson drinks and absently presses the glass against his face. Tom touches Wilson's face. Tom lets Wilson rest his head against his shoulder. Looking a little awkward, Tom rubs Wilson's back, comforting him. Nick covers Myrtle's body with the sheet. Tom drives away with Jordan. They stare ahead. The shiny blue coupe heads on down the dark road. They arrive at the Buchanan mansion. Servants come out. Tom walks up and opens the front door. Nick and Jordan stand on the porch. Tom studies Nick. Nick stares back, frowning. With a dismissive glance, Tom goes inside. Nick glares at Jordan. Shocked, she marches into the house. Looking deeply troubled, his brow pinched, Nick turns and walks off. Nick looks around incredulously and walks over to Gatsby, who's hiding behind a bush. Gatsby's face is suddenly bathed in light. Lights come on in the house and the butler, Henri, comes out onto the porch. He looks around but doesn't see anyone, so goes back inside. Nick stares at Gatsby gravely. Gatsby glances up at the lights in the upstairs windows, then back at Nick. A flashback of Gatsby grabbing the wheel. Gatsby and Daisy watch in horror as Myrtle slams against the windscreen and hurtles through the air. Daisy is in the driving seat. Recounting events, Gatsby looks distraught. Nick stares at him, wide-eyed. Gatsby turns away and sits. Gatsby rests his face against his hand. Nick nods sharply and attempts a smile. Nick surreptitiously walks around to the terrace. He sees Tom and Daisy sitting at the dining table, talking. Daisy sits looking dazed. Tom moves closer and puts his arm around Daisy, who looks lost.",
    "998": "In his room, Nick starts to write. He lays down the open book. Nick stares at the silver pencil resting on the blank page. The doctor walks over to him. Men stand on hills of coal waste, hacking away with pickaxes. A filthy industrial area. Nick's on a packed train with Tom. The train stops. They jump from the train and run off. Tom leads Nick to a garage. She eyes Tom. She smiles. Tom slips her some money. Tom points at Nick. Myrtle eyes Nick. Nick looks nervous. Nick sits in Myrtle's apartment in town, watching her little dog eat leftovers off a plate. The living room is extremely gaudy, with red walls and furnishings and chintzy flower prints everywhere. Nick sits on the edge of the couch, glancing at the ceiling. He frowns at the sound of Tom and Myrtle upstairs. Nick tentatively walks to the door. He puts on his straw boater and opens the door. There's a sexy, young woman wearing lots of dark eye shadow and a green dress leaning on the door frame. Myrtle appears. Weakening, Nick smiles. Tom picks him up. Catherine drapes herself around Nick in a chair. Catherine pops a pill in her mouth and plants a kiss on Nick, transferring the pill into his mouth. In a clinch with Myrtle, Tom watches. Catherine guides Nick's glass to his lips. Catherine cocks an eyebrow at Nick. Tom dances with Myrtle. Nick dances with Catherine. Chester takes pictures. Tom opens champagne. Tom whacks Nick with a pillow. Feathers go everywhere. A guy plays trumpet on a fire escape. Tom picks Nick up and twirls him around. Catherine kisses Nick and pulls his shirt off. The girls strip down to their underwear. Everyone's dancing. Nick sits watching woozily with Catherine slumped against him. Myrtle wiggles her hips, pulls her red dress off her shoulder and holds her arms in the air. Nick sits, drugged. Another version of himself pops a champagne cork. He shakes the bottle, fizzing the champagne up, then pours some into his wide-open mouth. Tom pours champagne into the seated Nick's mouth from a ceramic goblet. Nick sways on the spot with glazed, drunken eyes. Nick's exuberant self rolls about on a bed with Catherine. The woozy Nick goes to a window and looks across at other apartments. A young black woman leans on her window ledge, looking out. He sees himself standing in the street, looking up. His street self walks off. Scenes play out in windows. Nick finds Chester sleeping and wipes cream off his face. Myrtle marches in, followed by Tom. Tom gives Myrtle a vicious backhander across the face. Nick retreats onto the fire escape. The city recedes."
